What is Wellbeing? Wellbeing is comprised of numerous dimensions that influence an individual’s quality and duration of life. This is broader than just the traditional definition of health. Wellness is achieved through the inter- action of physical, mental and social factors that help people to thrive and flourish. There are many models of wellbeing, or wellness. Topics included in a national measure of wellbeing, the Gallup Sharecare Well- being Index project which has surveyed Americans since 2008, include: a sense of purpose, social relationships, financial security, relationship to community and physical health. The Eight Dimensions of Wellness, are highlighted in the Wellness Wheel in Image 1, as promoted by the National Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The intercon- nectedness of factors that impact wellness has strong correlations with 6 The Wellbeing of Somerville Report 2017 / Introduction & User GuideIMAGE 1: The Wellness Wheel Changes in the health care environment since the 2011 report: Since the development of the 2011 report, there have been signif- Emotional icant changes in the health care landscape nationally. The passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in March 2010 with two major aims - to expand health insurance Social Spiritual coverage and to reform the delivery system for health care in the U.S. The law brought into motion changes that increased the number of people covered by health care insurance at the national and the local level. This was partly made possible by federal subsidies and the expansion at the state level of Medicaid programs to include coverage for adults at 138% Occupational Intellectual or less of the federal poverty level. Also, young adults were allowed to be covered under their parents’ coverage as dependents up to age 26. The impacts on the healthcare system are aimed at achieving the goals of improving health outcomes, while lowering costs and improving Financial Physical health insurance access. Some of the strategies put into action by the ACA include: changes to the reimbursement system; linking payment to providers of health services to performance measures; changes in how Environmental health care delivery is organized, with the advent of Accountable Care Organizations intended to provide integrated comprehensive services at Wellness Wheel a set cost for a defined population, initially beneficiaries of Medicare, and both health across the lifespan and the impacts of social determinants later expanded to Medicaid (known as MassHealth in Massachusetts); of health.

For instance, research shows that both positive and negative childhood experiences influence health throughout life. The impacts of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are connected to a long list of possible negative health outcomes, increasingly recognized as a public health issue (CDC). Healthy communities can support resiliency in children through nurturing relationships and by tackling systemic inequality. The life course approach provides a way to strategize effective actions to improve health over the entire lifetime. It also promotes an integrated, holistic and innovative way to look at health and ways that a community can promote health through interventions ranging from before birth to older adults. National health data indicates that some health issues such as infectious disease management have seen improvements, but that health disparities have become persistent and have not been shifted within the present paradigm. This approach also highlights that in order to promote health and wellbeing, health care and public health need to join forces with other providers and perhaps new stakeholders to reduce health inequities through structural systemic changes in existing systems that hinder equal opportunity for optimal health for all. 9Across the life course, interventions can be specifically tailored to each (Macmillan Dictionary).

The median income for Somerville, as reported in the ACS (2011-2015), is $73,106 with 14.7% percent of people living in poverty. An estimated 22.7% of children under 18 were living below the poverty level, as were 14.2% of people 65 and over. An estimated 17% of families with children and 43.2% of families with a female householder and no husband present had incomes below the poverty level. With a limited supply of subsidized housing units for low-income individuals and families, the result of high housing costs has been a decrease in the percentage of housing available to resi- dents (and potential residents) with moderate incomes and resources. Concurrent with these housing changes have been changes to the local retail environment, including the rise in specialty stores, restaurants, social and fitness establishments.

Early Childhood Development (EMC-1) objectives for young chil- dren include increasing the proportion of children who are ready for school in all five domains of healthy development: physical development, social-emotional development, approaches to learning, language and cognitive development. The Somerville Public Schools, in collaboration with community partners, are working toward a strategic continuum of early childhood education services. A multi-sector Early Educa- tion Steering Committee helps guide the movement towards universal Kindergarten readiness. This includes attention to issues including systemic equity, access, multilingual capacity and culturally responsive teaching, community engagement and support and high quality educa- tional programming. In Somerville, there are a range of programs aimed at early learning opportunities, such as the following:Head Start, offered by the Community Action Agency of Somerville, • provided services for 195 children ages 3-5 in 2016-2017. • SomerBaby’s goal is to welcome new babies to Somerville. The pilot City program provided welcome baby bags, useful baby supplies, community resources, and a home visit for up to 100 new parents in the city in the first year, in collaboration with local providers. • The Riverside Somerville Early Head Start program served at least 107 children in 2016-2017. • The Parent Child Home Program of Somerville Family Learning Collabo- rative (SFLC), a home visiting program with a goal of preparing children to enter school “ready to learn,” served 41 children in 2016-2017.

According to the 2011 Massachu- setts Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System Report (PRAMS) report, overall, about 3% of Massachusetts mothers reported “feeling stressed due to their race/ethnic background,” 3% of mothers reported “feeling emotionally upset as a result of how they were treated by others,” and about 3% reported “experiencing physical symptoms related to treatment based on their race/ethnic background.” Minority mothers reported more negative experiences due to racism. Research in recent years is suggesting that intergenerational stress can negatively affect the health of newborn babies, based initially on empir- ical evidence from Holocaust survivors. This work is based on genetics, environment, parenting, and social learning, and is demonstrating that stress can cause detrimental biological changes across generations as transmitted via gametes, the gestational uterine environment, and early postnatal care (Bowers and Yehuda, 2017). Social Safety Network/Social Support Social supports and resultant safety networks can generate from varied sources. Extended family and/or close friends may offer companionship, wisdom, solace and assistance. There has been a rise of “blended” families, with adults bringing children into the home from different marriages, and grandparents living with younger generations or, in some instances, raising grandchildren on their own. For some families with young chil- dren, a faith-based community may provide both spiritual and social supports. For others, support may manifest through virtual communities. One local media venue, the SomervilleMoms listserv, has grown since forming in 2003 to include almost 5,000 members, providing a forum for sharing parenting topics, with a Somerville focus. Literature raises the concern that social media connections may not be protective against social isolation. Interventions such as home visiting programs have been demonstrated to help support new parents, connecting them to resources promoting positive parenting and child development. 41 Birth–Age 4Social media Another important aspect of the work of the Somerville Family Family service providers report high usage of screen time and social Learning Collaborative is leadership development for parents and guard- media by parents/guardians and a rise in screen time for infants and ians. These opportunities include skills building on how to advocate for toddlers, which the providers observe as changing the levels of direct your child, English as a Second Language classes, and parent forums.

Initiatives such as the Talk number of community organizations, such as Parenting Journey, Mystic Time campaign launched in Fall 2017 are geared to promote authentic Learning Center and The Welcome Project also offer opportunities for interaction between parents and children as an alternative to screen time parents to be actively engaged in learning about and promoting their while building protective emotional connections and promoting early own health and wellbeing as they also facilitate the positive development literacy. of their children. Strategies for creating social media plans and screen-free times for adults as well as children can help promote greater interpersonal inter- actions and connections. Social media can have positive impacts on building community connections, essential to creating social networks and support systems. Violence Abuse or a history of domestic violence in the home of a young child is one of the adverse childhood experiences that has been shown to increase risk for health and wellbeing in later life stages. The Somerville Police Department tracks how many domestic assault calls involve youth. From 2010-2016, the range varied from a low of 13% in 2010, to a high of 25% in 2013 and was most recently at 18% in 2016, which equals 35 cases in 2016 that involved youth (of any age). Community Engagement Parents of young children benefit from meeting with other parents, especially as many of them do not have the close familial support that past generations took for granted. Some families do have grandparents nearby, who can assist with childcare and child rearing. Opportunities such as programming for children at the public library or SFLC Play- groups and Parent Groups provide positive development time for infants and toddlers, while also creating community for parents. 42 The Wellbeing of Somerville Report 2017 / Prenatal & Early ChildhoodBirth–Age 4 Recommendations for Prenatal & Early Childhood n Increase access to health promoting resources for all women of child-bearing age, new parents, infants and toddlers • Increase percentage of all pregnant women receiving early and adequate prenatal care, specifically engaging pregnant teens • Reduce teen pregnancies with sensitivity to culturally diverse norms • Support programs, policies and language that recognize the vital role that fathers and male role models have in children’s and families’ lives n C reate lifelong habits to promote mental and behavioral health and prevent Adverse Childhood Experiences. • Convene Prenatal Early Childhood forum to integrate services of health, non-profit, school and clinical providers • Identify, engage and support parents with depression, with • Increase early screening and referral to Early Intervention an emphasis on postpartum depression and connection to supportive community resources, for all • Provide professional development for childcare providers on families how to enhance protective factors that positively influence n C reate lifelong habits to promote a young child’s development and mitigate risk factors physical health for all children n F acilitate a community with strong social networks and support systems • Promote and adopt policies related to evidence-based strat- egies to facilitate children being ready for kindergarten • Improve access to quality, affordable child care for all; define • Utilize the Shape Up Under 5 campaign materials to inform community standards a community wide approach to healthy eating, physical • Explore policies to support equitable family leave activity, sleep and screen time • Bring to scale and sustain culturally and language appro- • Raise awareness and utilization of the City’s lead abatement priate home visiting program for all newborns and their programs parents • Identify links between built environment and housing with • Increase knowledge and skills to promote positive child respiratory health/asthma prevention for young children development and build social networks for caregivers The Wellbeing of Somerville Report 2017 43School Age/Adolescent Introduction also without their primary caretakers continues to be very important, as risks for accidents, injuries and abuse (at one’s own hand or that of F ollowing the earliest years of life, the time between the ages of others’) remain high during these years. 5-18 years continues to be a period of rapid growth and develop- ment.

As indicated on the map, the highest concentra- tion of youth (5-17 years) is found in census blocks where family public housing is located. A number of census blocks have less than 3% of their population in this life stage group. The racial/ethnic demographics of the Somerville school age popula- tion are more diverse than the overall population in the city. The capacity of local service organizations to meet changing language and cultural needs is compounded by the growing disparity in wealth. This can impact the perception of need in a community like Somerville, at the same time that the support needs for some residents are on the rise.

Good physical health at a young age can be a protective factor against many health problems in the future, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory difficulties.

Additionally, to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables, the public schools have participated in the national Farms to Schools move- ment and set up salad bars and offer fruit or vegetable snacks. Between 2003 and 2015, there was a 37% increase in middle school students reporting they had eaten 3 servings of vegetables during the previous day (from 8.4% to 11.5%) and a 13% decrease in the percent of students who reported having had no servings of vegetables on the day prior (from 37.2% to 32.4%) (Somerville MS YRBS).Much of a student’s opportunity for physical activity during the day comes during school hours or through school sponsored programs.

As a result of their immigration experience, many students feel anxious and depressed and report being bullied by their peers. Many of these students have less formal education than their peers, as well as less medical or dental care history. Unaccompanied minors and other immigrants at Somer- ville High School are not the only population in Somerville that have experienced ACEs. However, these students are among those who most benefit from culturally sensitive and trauma-informed approaches. Trauma-informed school environments are those that create a sense of safety and stability through routines, clear expectations and modeling emotional regulation.

An issue impacting Somerville is the introduction of ultrafine particles to neighborhoods in close proximity to Interstate 93. Such exposures have been linked to elevated levels of asthma, respiratory infections and heart disease. These outcomes disproportionately affect those living in the I-93 area. Young children are vulnerable to cumula- tive impacts of local air pollution, especially if they are also experiencing secondhand smoke or other allergens in the home environment.

Mental Health There can be many factors that make the mental health of early adults particularly tenuous, such as facing the expected challenges of estab- lishing a career, securing housing and developing lifelong relationships. Larger external forces also have an impact, such as the 2007-2009 Great Recession’s changes in the economic situations affecting the transition from early adulthood, or changes in immigration policy that affect the options for youth who arrived in the U.S. as children. Early adults may be especially vulnerable to racial, social and economic inequities, making this period even more stressful. Prior expectations and aspirations regarding independence are challenged by the high cost of living and stagnant wage growth in the region, making it more likely that adults of this age are sharing housing or still living at home and/or dependent on their families financially, potentially adding to overall stress. Research indicates that when communities adopt “through any door” models of providing resources, individuals are more comfortable in asking for help and more likely to access services. Such a model is one in which individual service providers are part of a network of care designed to prioritize client needs and in recognition of the interconnectedness of factors that support wellbeing. An example of this is when a mental health provider makes referrals for needs such as housing, jobs or phys- ical health screenings in order to support the overall wellbeing of clients. 74 The Wellbeing of Somerville Report 2017 / Early AdultMindfulness and Compassion 9000 The Center of Mindfulness 7,786 8000 and Compassion (CMC) is an 7000 6000 5,579 interdisciplinary center with 5,071 5000 4,765 Cambridge Health Alliance 4,139 4,137 4000 3,385 3,101 which aims to enhance the 2,826 3000 health and wellbeing of CHA 1,805 2000 1,483 and the local community by 1000 467 0 integrating mindfulness and compassion into healthcare.

Food Security The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or “Food Stamps”) is available to support a portion of food budgets for those who meet income and other qualifications. Though data is not avail- able specifically for early adults, in 2015, 9.3% of the 32,000 Somerville households received some SNAP benefits. This is an increase of 4.9% from 2010. The highest percentage of distribution of SNAP beneficiaries, between 2010-2015, was in the Black/African-American population 83 Ages 18–24(28.8%) and Hispanic population (19.5%); Black/African Americans and Natural and Built Environment Asians participation doubled during this period (American Community Survey).

The City of Somer- ville is noted for its efforts to create a built environment that promotes healthier choices. The local natural environment has seen much change over centuries of development, with concentrated effort required to reclaim or restore natural resources such as the Mystic River and urban trees, which add to the character and livability of the city, and provide access to greenspaces within the urban setting. One of the goals of SomerVision calls for creating 125 acres of new open space by 2030, a challenging goal in this densely packed city that at the same time needs more housing. Housing (safe, affordable and accessible) Like the national trend, detailed by Richard Fry in multiple Pew Research Center reports, some Somerville early adults live at home or with family members to make it affordable. There is a long history in Somerville of renting larger apartments to groups of young people. This started near the universities, but has spread through much of the city. Young people now compete directly for available housing with fami- lies that have more than two children in an increasingly tight market. Sometimes, young people or even families have been victims of landlords looking to maximize profits while compromising safety by creating base- ment units or units without basic amenities, particularly impacting new arrivals or those who do not speak English well. According to Harvard researcher David Williams, known for his work in health equity, where we live, work and play has a greater impact on how well and how long we live than medical care. 84 The Wellbeing of Somerville Report 2017 / Early AdultSafe and Secure Neighborhoods Arrests of 16-20 year olds in Somerville have decreased dramatically In 2014, Somerville was the first Massachusetts city to from 151 in 2010 to 69 in 2016.

Cambridge. In 2013, it made the nation’s Top 10 list. The Transit Score is 62/100, rating the public’s access to public transportation (Walk Score). In 2014, Somerville was the first Massachusetts city to pass an ordi- nance for Complete Streets to support a safe, convenient and healthier community. The ordinance calls for city streets to be equitably available for all forms of transportation including cars, bikes and pedestrians, and has required changes in the way the city plan, designs, implements and maintains it streets. Somerville has developed a visibly bike-friendly infrastructure and related polices that encourages many early adults to bike. The addition of Hubway bike sharing stations throughout the city has made biking even more accessible for some residents. Car sharing options, as well as ride-hailing systems, have further revolutionized transportation for the younger generation, who have little need to own a car in Somerville. Environmental Health Environmental factors can lead to a variety of negative health outcomes. A concerning issue impacting Somerville is the introduction of ultrafine particles in areas in close proximity to Interstate 93, which research ties to elevated levels of asthma, respiratory infections and heart disease. These outcomes disproportionately affect those living in the I-93 area as well as bicyclists and walkers. A study by Jarjour et al. (2013) found that while there are negative effects on bicyclists, these individuals still have better health outcomes than those who get no exercise. 85 Ages 18–24Social and Community Context As mentioned earlier in this report, many in this age group are expe- riencing a prolonged transition to independence and a delayed adoption of traditional roles and milestones of adulthood that impacts their social and community context. The vast influence of social media also intrudes into daily life, affecting social interactions—and reportedly having impacts on mental health for young people. Race This age group is growing up in a more diverse U.S. population cohort than their parents. Fifty years after the U.S. Supreme Court removed legal barriers barring interracial marriages, the percentage of interracial and interethnic marriages had risen to 17% of all marriages in 2015. White and Hispanic/Latino couples have the highest rate of interracial marriage, at 42% of all interracial marriages, while marriages between Climate Change U.S. born Blacks and Whites are 11% of the total of intermarried couples With significant turnover of students and young adults in Somerville, (Livingston and Brown, 2017). younger residents who are new to Somerville may be less informed about local climate risks and may not be aware of emergency alerts and services A prominent issue extending across the life course is the discrepancy available, leaving them vulnerable to climate variations. Early adults who in opinion on race relations between the White and Black population in live in rented apartments may have less capacity to make improvements the US. One telling figure shows that 70% of Black Americans believe to their homes and therefore could be more vulnerable to heat waves and that racial discrimination is the reason why it is harder to get ahead, flooding. while only 36% of White Americans believe that racial discrimination makes it harder for Black Americans to get ahead (On Views of Race, Access to Nature and Open Space Pew, 2016). Additionally, Whites are less likely to fault institutional Many young adults between the age of 20-35 enjoy being active in racism as compared to Blacks, with 70% of the White population finding Somerville because of various local social recreational opportunities. that prejudice against individuals is the most pressing issue at hand.

Domestic assault can occur at any age, but early adults can be especially vulnerable to exploitation. Human trafficking is an issue that can often impact vulnerable young adults, attracting international, national and state attention. There is a national Blue Campaign, to help increase awareness and educate the public on human trafficking, with a focus on first responders and law enforcement. Human Trafficking is described by the US Homeland Security as “a modern-day form of slavery involving the illegal trade of people for exploitation or commercial gain.” This may involve sexual exploitation, or labor related exploitation, with 4,460 cases reported in the U.S. in 2017 by the National Human Trafficking Hotline. In 2017, they reported 40 cases connected to Massachusetts, but since this is an issue about which many victims have been silenced, the exact magnitude of this issue in Somerville is still unclear. the life of the community.

Such changes can have an impact on physical and mental health. While these changes may help build resiliency and protective factors for some, others feel the stress to get a job, make money, be successful quickly and the overall weight of taking on life responsibilities. Today’s young adults can often struggle with the multitude of options available, triggering anxiety, depression, a sense of despair and/or a lost sense of belonging. This age cohort has seen the growth of personal computers and the internet, cable access and MTV as well as increased access to fast foods and ready-made foods.

Overall nationally, the older U.S. population is growing, more than doubling between 1975 and 2015, as the baby-boomers age. Data estimates from 2011-2015 indicated that 4.2% of the total U.S. popula- tion was over 75 years of age (Health, United States, 2016). The race/ethnicity distribution of older adults in Somerville, according to 2015 government estimates was: 88.8% White, 5.6% Black or Afri- can-American, 4.7% Asian, and 3.6% of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race). The race/ethnicity distribution in Massachusetts, according to 2015 US Census estimates was: 79.6% White, 7.1% Black or Afri- can-American, 6.0% Asian, and 10.6% of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race). In 2015, just over 75% of the U.S. older adult population was non-Hispanic White, 8.8% was non-Hispanic Black, and 7.9% was Hispanic/Latino (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). Based on the most recent available data, from 2015, 29.5% of Somerville residents 65 or older were not U.S. citizens, 23.4% spoke English less than “very well,” 38.2% had a disability, and 14.2% lived below 100% of energy across the world, while also escalating the nuclear arms race for the poverty level (American Community Survey (ACS)).

Most Americans over the age of 65 are eligible for Medicare, to assist with medical coverage. Additionally, low income seniors and people with disabilities have access to Medicaid support. At the time of this publication, the future of health care access for immi- grants is not certain, as proposed legislation would severely impact the eligibility of immigrants and/or create waiting periods for accessing federal healthcare supports. Somerville adults age 65 or older have the highest rates of health insurance coverage of all age groups, with only 0.4% without coverage. The number of Somerville residents served by Medicare in 2015 included 27.0% who were Medicare Managed Care enrollees (where individuals pay extra premiums to help cover costs beyond Medicare coverage) and 23.5% who were dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (due to income eligibility).

Older adults have higher rates of diabetes than other age groups, across the U.S., with more than a quarter of Americans 65 and older with this diagnosis. Diabetes can be linked to higher risk factors for cardiovascular disease, as well as higher levels of nursing home placement. Other risk factors include a higher rate of dementia and cognitive deficits, neuropa- thies, falls, depression and vision impairment (Kirkman et al., 2017). Based on Chart 4, rates of hospitalizations between 2010-2012 (3-year • average) for Diabetes Mellitus were higher in Somerville than the state rate for Hispanics/Latinos, Whites and Asians. Hispanics/Latinos and Blacks have the highest rates of hospitalizations, compared to Whites, with Asians having the lowest rate (UHDDS). • Additional state data indicates that Diabetes Mellitus has been the leading cause of hospitalizations for residents 65 and older in both Somerville and the state as a whole.

Falls National statistics on falls and older adults indicate more than a third of people over 65 will fall each year and the risks increase with age. Falls are often associated with fractures and potential reduced mobility and/or independence and are the leading cause of injury deaths in older adults.

As a result of some of these vulnerabilities, older individuals – across all income brackets – have a greater reliance on support services, including senior centers and cooling centers during high heat events. Elderly residents that live alone may be more socially isolated and lack reliable access to transportation, which can make it more difficult for them to access support services or evacuate during emergency events. The City of Somerville currently provides transportation to seniors and disabled resi- dents during storm events and high heat days; climate change is likely to increase demand for these types of services as such events become more frequent.

According to a PEW report, Black adults over fifty have the worst perception on race relations in the US, with 65% believing that relations are “generally bad,” compared to 58% for those who are 18-50 (Wormald, 2016).

Nearly 50% of Medicare recipients that died in 2014 had received end of life care from hospice, an increase greater than 20% since 2000 (Price et al., 2017).

Similar surveys are conducted at the state and local leveks on varied schedules, accessing similar risk factors. These health risk behav- iors include: • Behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence • Sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infec- tions, including HIV infection • Alcohol and other drug use • Tobacco use • Unhealthy dietary behaviors • Inadequate physical activity Walk Score/Bike Score/ Walk Score is a number between 0 and 100 that measures the walkability of any address, usually between two points. Bike Score is a number between 0 and 100 that measures the bikeability of any address, usually between two points Wellbeing Wellbeing is comprised of numerous dimensions that influence an individual’s qual- ity and duration of life. Wellbeing integrates mental health (mind) and physical health (body) resulting in more holistic approaches to disease prevention and health promo- tion. Wellbeing is a valid population outcome measure beyond morbidity, mortality and economic status that tells us how people perceive their life is going from their own per- spective. Results from cross-sectional, longitudinal and experimental studies find that wellbeing is associated with: self-perceived health; longevity; healthy behaviors; mental and physical illness; social connectedness; productivity; factors in the physical and social environment. Wellbeing can provide a common metric that can help policy makers shape and compare the effects of different policies measuring, tracking and promoting wellbeing can be useful for multiple stakeholders involved in disease prevention and health promotion. Wellbeing is associated with numerous health, job, family and eco- nomically related benefits.

What is Wellbeing? Wellbeing is comprised of numerous dimensions that influence an individual’s quality and duration of life. This is broader than just the traditional definition of health. Wellness is achieved through the inter- action of physical, mental and social factors that help people to thrive and flourish. There are many models of wellbeing, or wellness. Topics included in a national measure of wellbeing, the Gallup Sharecare Well- being Index project which has surveyed Americans since 2008, include: a sense of purpose, social relationships, financial security, relationship to community and physical health. The Eight Dimensions of Wellness, are highlighted in the Wellness Wheel in Image 1, as promoted by the National Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The intercon- nectedness of factors that impact wellness has strong correlations with 6 The Wellbeing of Somerville Report 2017 / Introduction & User Guide",

The passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in March 2010 with two major aims - to expand health insurance Social Spiritual coverage and to reform the delivery system for health care in the U.S. The law brought into motion changes that increased the number of people covered by health care insurance at the national and the local level. This was partly made possible by federal subsidies and the expansion at the state level of Medicaid programs to include coverage for adults at 138% Occupational Intellectual or less of the federal poverty level. Also, young adults were allowed to be covered under their parents’ coverage as dependents up to age 26. The impacts on the healthcare system are aimed at achieving the goals of improving health outcomes, while lowering costs and improving Financial Physical health insurance access. Some of the strategies put into action by the ACA include: changes to the reimbursement system; linking payment to providers of health services to performance measures; changes in how Environmental health care delivery is organized, with the advent of Accountable Care Organizations intended to provide integrated comprehensive services at Wellness Wheel a set cost for a defined population, initially beneficiaries of Medicare, and both health across the lifespan and the impacts of social determinants later expanded to Medicaid (known as MassHealth in Massachusetts); of health.

For instance, research shows that both positive and negative childhood experiences influence health throughout life. The impacts of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are connected to a long list of possible negative health outcomes, increasingly recognized as a public health issue (CDC). Healthy communities can support resiliency in children through nurturing relationships and by tackling systemic inequality. The life course approach provides a way to strategize effective actions to improve health over the entire lifetime. It also promotes an integrated, holistic and innovative way to look at health and ways that a community can promote health through interventions ranging from before birth to older adults. National health data indicates that some health issues such as infectious disease management have seen improvements, but that health disparities have become persistent and have not been shifted within the present paradigm. This approach also highlights that in order to promote health and wellbeing, health care and public health need to join forces with other providers and perhaps new stakeholders to reduce health inequities through structural systemic changes in existing systems that hinder equal opportunity for optimal health for all. 9",

The median income for Somerville, as reported in the ACS (2011-2015), is $73,106 with 14.7% percent of people living in poverty. An estimated 22.7% of children under 18 were living below the poverty level, as were 14.2% of people 65 and over. An estimated 17% of families with children and 43.2% of families with a female householder and no husband present had incomes below the poverty level. With a limited supply of subsidized housing units for low-income individuals and families, the result of high housing costs has been a decrease in the percentage of housing available to resi- dents (and potential residents) with moderate incomes and resources. Concurrent with these housing changes have been changes to the local retail environment, including the rise in specialty stores, restaurants, social and fitness establishments.

        "Protective Factors Breastfeeding naturally supports early nutritional needs adding protection against infectious diseases and childhood obesity. Increasing the proportion of infants who are breastfed is important to improving the health of the next generation and is one of the Maternal and Child Health indicators. It is a recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of a child’s life (AAP, 2012). Currently, breastfeeding support (LC-04) is measured nationally by the percentage of babies born in Baby Friendly Hospitals that elect to follow ten “Steps to Successful Breast- feeding” (www.babyfriendlyusa.org).

        "baby over the short and long term. According to the 2011 Massachu- setts Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System Report (PRAMS) report, overall, about 3% of Massachusetts mothers reported “feeling stressed due to their race/ethnic background,” 3% of mothers reported “feeling emotionally upset as a result of how they were treated by others,” and about 3% reported “experiencing physical symptoms related to treatment based on their race/ethnic background.” Minority mothers reported more negative experiences due to racism. Research in recent years is suggesting that intergenerational stress can negatively affect the health of newborn babies, based initially on empir- ical evidence from Holocaust survivors. This work is based on genetics, environment, parenting, and social learning, and is demonstrating that stress can cause detrimental biological changes across generations as transmitted via gametes, the gestational uterine environment, and early postnatal care (Bowers and Yehuda, 2017). Social Safety Network/Social Support Social supports and resultant safety networks can generate from varied sources. Extended family and/or close friends may offer companionship, wisdom, solace and assistance. There has been a rise of “blended” families, with adults bringing children into the home from different marriages, and grandparents living with younger generations or, in some instances, raising grandchildren on their own. For some families with young chil- dren, a faith-based community may provide both spiritual and social supports. For others, support may manifest through virtual communities. One local media venue, the SomervilleMoms listserv, has grown since forming in 2003 to include almost 5,000 members, providing a forum for sharing parenting topics, with a Somerville focus. Literature raises the concern that social media connections may not be protective against social isolation. Interventions such as home visiting programs have been demonstrated to help support new parents, connecting them to resources promoting positive parenting and child development. 41 Birth–Age 4",

Strategies for creating social media plans and screen-free times for adults as well as children can help promote greater interpersonal inter- actions and connections. Social media can have positive impacts on building community connections, essential to creating social networks and support systems. Violence Abuse or a history of domestic violence in the home of a young child is one of the adverse childhood experiences that has been shown to increase risk for health and wellbeing in later life stages. The Somerville Police Department tracks how many domestic assault calls involve youth. From 2010-2016, the range varied from a low of 13% in 2010, to a high of 25% in 2013 and was most recently at 18% in 2016, which equals 35 cases in 2016 that involved youth (of any age). Community Engagement Parents of young children benefit from meeting with other parents, especially as many of them do not have the close familial support that past generations took for granted. Some families do have grandparents nearby, who can assist with childcare and child rearing. Opportunities such as programming for children at the public library or SFLC Play- groups and Parent Groups provide positive development time for infants and toddlers, while also creating community for parents. 42 The Wellbeing of Somerville Report 2017 / Prenatal & Early Childhood",

As indicated on the map, the highest concentra- tion of youth (5-17 years) is found in census blocks where family public housing is located. A number of census blocks have less than 3% of their population in this life stage group. The racial/ethnic demographics of the Somerville school age popula- tion are more diverse than the overall population in the city. The capacity of local service organizations to meet changing language and cultural needs is compounded by the growing disparity in wealth. This can impact the perception of need in a community like Somerville, at the same time that the support needs for some residents are on the rise.

Mental Health There can be many factors that make the mental health of early adults particularly tenuous, such as facing the expected challenges of estab- lishing a career, securing housing and developing lifelong relationships. Larger external forces also have an impact, such as the 2007-2009 Great Recession’s changes in the economic situations affecting the transition from early adulthood, or changes in immigration policy that affect the options for youth who arrived in the U.S. as children. Early adults may be especially vulnerable to racial, social and economic inequities, making this period even more stressful. Prior expectations and aspirations regarding independence are challenged by the high cost of living and stagnant wage growth in the region, making it more likely that adults of this age are sharing housing or still living at home and/or dependent on their families financially, potentially adding to overall stress. Research indicates that when communities adopt “through any door” models of providing resources, individuals are more comfortable in asking for help and more likely to access services. Such a model is one in which individual service providers are part of a network of care designed to prioritize client needs and in recognition of the interconnectedness of factors that support wellbeing. An example of this is when a mental health provider makes referrals for needs such as housing, jobs or phys- ical health screenings in order to support the overall wellbeing of clients. 74 The Wellbeing of Somerville Report 2017 / Early Adult",

Food Security The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or “Food Stamps”) is available to support a portion of food budgets for those who meet income and other qualifications. Though data is not avail- able specifically for early adults, in 2015, 9.3% of the 32,000 Somerville households received some SNAP benefits. This is an increase of 4.9% from 2010.

The City of Somer- ville is noted for its efforts to create a built environment that promotes healthier choices. The local natural environment has seen much change over centuries of development, with concentrated effort required to reclaim or restore natural resources such as the Mystic River and urban trees, which add to the character and livability of the city, and provide access to greenspaces within the urban setting. One of the goals of SomerVision calls for creating 125 acres of new open space by 2030, a challenging goal in this densely packed city that at the same time needs more housing. Housing (safe, affordable and accessible) Like the national trend, detailed by Richard Fry in multiple Pew Research Center reports, some Somerville early adults live at home or with family members to make it affordable. There is a long history in Somerville of renting larger apartments to groups of young people. This started near the universities, but has spread through much of the city. Young people now compete directly for available housing with fami- lies that have more than two children in an increasingly tight market. Sometimes, young people or even families have been victims of landlords looking to maximize profits while compromising safety by creating base- ment units or units without basic amenities, particularly impacting new arrivals or those who do not speak English well.

In 2014, Somerville was the first Massachusetts city to pass an ordi- nance for Complete Streets to support a safe, convenient and healthier community. The ordinance calls for city streets to be equitably available for all forms of transportation including cars, bikes and pedestrians, and has required changes in the way the city plan, designs, implements and maintains it streets. Somerville has developed a visibly bike-friendly infrastructure and related polices that encourages many early adults to bike. The addition of Hubway bike sharing stations throughout the city has made biking even more accessible for some residents. Car sharing options, as well as ride-hailing systems, have further revolutionized transportation for the younger generation, who have little need to own a car in Somerville. Environmental Health Environmental factors can lead to a variety of negative health outcomes. A concerning issue impacting Somerville is the introduction of ultrafine particles in areas in close proximity to Interstate 93, which research ties to elevated levels of asthma, respiratory infections and heart disease. These outcomes disproportionately affect those living in the I-93 area as well as bicyclists and walkers. A study by Jarjour et al. (2013) found that while there are negative effects on bicyclists, these individuals still have better health outcomes than those who get no exercise. 85 Ages 18–24",

The vast influence of social media also intrudes into daily life, affecting social interactions—and reportedly having impacts on mental health for young people. Race This age group is growing up in a more diverse U.S. population cohort than their parents. Fifty years after the U.S. Supreme Court removed legal barriers barring interracial marriages, the percentage of interracial and interethnic marriages had risen to 17% of all marriages in 2015. White and Hispanic/Latino couples have the highest rate of interracial marriage, at 42% of all interracial marriages, while marriages between Climate Change U.S. born Blacks and Whites are 11% of the total of intermarried couples With significant turnover of students and young adults in Somerville, (Livingston and Brown, 2017). younger residents who are new to Somerville may be less informed about local climate risks and may not be aware of emergency alerts and services A prominent issue extending across the life course is the discrepancy available, leaving them vulnerable to climate variations.

Domestic assault can occur at any age, but early adults can be especially vulnerable to exploitation. Human trafficking is an issue that can often impact vulnerable young adults, attracting international, national and state attention. There is a national Blue Campaign, to help increase awareness and educate the public on human trafficking, with a focus on first responders and law enforcement. Human Trafficking is described by the US Homeland Security as “a modern-day form of slavery involving the illegal trade of people for exploitation or commercial gain.” This may involve sexual exploitation, or labor related exploitation, with 4,460 cases reported in the U.S. in 2017 by the National Human Trafficking Hotline. In 2017, they reported 40 cases connected to Massachusetts, but since this is an issue about which many victims have been silenced, the exact magnitude of this issue in Somerville is still unclear. the life of the community.

Overall nationally, the older U.S. population is growing, more than doubling between 1975 and 2015, as the baby-boomers age. Data estimates from 2011-2015 indicated that 4.2% of the total U.S. popula- tion was over 75 years of age (Health, United States, 2016). The race/ethnicity distribution of older adults in Somerville, according to 2015 government estimates was: 88.8% White, 5.6% Black or Afri- can-American, 4.7% Asian, and 3.6% of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race). The race/ethnicity distribution in Massachusetts, according to 2015 US Census estimates was: 79.6% White, 7.1% Black or Afri- can-American, 6.0% Asian, and 10.6% of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race). In 2015, just over 75% of the U.S. older adult population was non-Hispanic White, 8.8% was non-Hispanic Black, and 7.9% was Hispanic/Latino (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). Based on the most recent available data, from 2015, 29.5% of Somerville residents 65 or older were not U.S. citizens, 23.4% spoke English less than “very well,” 38.2% had a disability, and 14.2% lived below 100% of energy across the world, while also escalating the nuclear arms race for the poverty level (American Community Survey (ACS)).

        "Access to Healthcare Health Insurance Coverage Medical Health Insurance coverage (LC-40) is one of the predictors of health and wellbeing. Most Americans over the age of 65 are eligible for Medicare, to assist with medical coverage. Additionally, low income seniors and people with disabilities have access to Medicaid support. At the time of this publication, the future of health care access for immi- grants is not certain, as proposed legislation would severely impact the eligibility of immigrants and/or create waiting periods for accessing federal healthcare supports. Somerville adults age 65 or older have the highest rates of health insurance coverage of all age groups, with only 0.4% without coverage. The number of Somerville residents served by Medicare in 2015 included 27.0% who were Medicare Managed Care enrollees (where individuals pay extra premiums to help cover costs beyond Medicare coverage) and 23.5% who were dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (due to income eligibility).

Older adults have higher rates of diabetes than other age groups, across the U.S., with more than a quarter of Americans 65 and older with this diagnosis. Diabetes can be linked to higher risk factors for cardiovascular disease, as well as higher levels of nursing home placement. Other risk factors include a higher rate of dementia and cognitive deficits, neuropa- thies, falls, depression and vision impairment (Kirkman et al., 2017).

Cancer Age is a risk factor for developing cancer, with a 10 times greater incidence of cancer in those 65 or older than younger age groups. It is estimated that as the population ages, cancer will outstrip cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of death nationally.

Falls National statistics on falls and older adults indicate more than a third of people over 65 will fall each year and the risks increase with age. Falls are often associated with fractures and potential reduced mobility and/or independence and are the leading cause of injury deaths in older adults.

        "YRBS- Youth Risk Behavior Survey National survey conducted every two years to monitor priority health risk behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of death, disability and social problems among youth and adults in the United States. Similar surveys are conducted at the state and local leveks on varied schedules, accessing similar risk factors. These health risk behav- iors include: • Behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence • Sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infec- tions, including HIV infection • Alcohol and other drug use • Tobacco use • Unhealthy dietary behaviors • Inadequate physical activity Walk Score/Bike Score/ Walk Score is a number between 0 and 100 that measures the walkability of any address, usually between two points. Bike Score is a number between 0 and 100 that measures the bikeability of any address, usually between two points Wellbeing Wellbeing is comprised of numerous dimensions that influence an individual’s qual- ity and duration of life. Wellbeing integrates mental health (mind) and physical health (body) resulting in more holistic approaches to disease prevention and health promo- tion. Wellbeing is a valid population outcome measure beyond morbidity, mortality and economic status that tells us how people perceive their life is going from their own per- spective. Results from cross-sectional, longitudinal and experimental studies find that wellbeing is associated with: self-perceived health; longevity; healthy behaviors; mental and physical illness; social connectedness; productivity; factors in the physical and social environment. Wellbeing can provide a common metric that can help policy makers shape and compare the effects of different policies measuring, tracking and promoting wellbeing can be useful for multiple stakeholders involved in disease prevention and health promotion. Wellbeing is associated with numerous health, job, family and eco- nomically related benefits. Individuals with high levels of wellbeing are more productive at work and are more likely to contribute to their communities (adapted from https:// www.cdc.gov/hrqol/wellbeing.htm). 175",
