    "ALL TEXT": "JSIERRA Â· CLUB 16 June 2022 Vanessa Countryman, Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549-0609 Comments on S7-10-22 Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors To whom it may concern, Attached are the signatures and comments of 14,954 individuals who signed onto the following statement through the Sierra Club. The Securities and Exchange Commission's new draft rule for climate risk disclosure is a critical step in fulfilling its mandate to protect investors and capital markets. Far too many corporations do not disclose the climate risks they face, and they make climate-related commitments without disclosing information investors need to verify that they are living up to those commitments. Without this disclosure, investors cannot tell if companies will continue to be profitable and resilient as the economy transitions to clean energy. This is unfair to countless individuals like me who need to protect our savings for the long term. By setting a clear standard for businesses to disclose data about their preparations for the shift to a clean energy economy, as well as actions to address extreme weather and other climate change impacts, this rule will provide investors with the vital information they need to protect our financial futures. I applaud the Commission for addressing major gaps in corporate transparency and fulfilling its mission to protect investors. Although the rule addresses many climate risk transparency problems, it is not strong enough on one in particular: requirements for disclosure of emissions from clients, customers, and suppliers (Scope 3 emissions). While the draft rule likely would require some companies to disclose these emissions, many others would be able to evade key disclosures that investors want and need. The final rule MUST establish a clear Scope 3 disclosure requirement for all large public companies, and require that the accuracy of these disclosures be independently verified. Investors should not be left in the dark about this important source of climate risk. I look forward to the SEC's continued efforts to provide transparency regarding the threats that climate change poses to the savings of investors across our economy. 3,028 of these signers, you might also notice, added their own additional personal comments. If there are any questions about this statement or our positions on this matter do not hesitate to contact us.

        "JSIERRA Â· CLUB 16 June 2022 Vanessa Countryman, Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549-0609 Comments on S7-10-22 Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors To whom it may concern, Attached are the signatures and comments of 14,954 individuals who signed onto the following statement through the Sierra Club. The Securities and Exchange Commission's new draft rule for climate risk disclosure is a critical step in fulfilling its mandate to protect investors and capital markets. Far too many corporations do not disclose the climate risks they face, and they make climate-related commitments without disclosing information investors need to verify that they are living up to those commitments. Without this disclosure, investors cannot tell if companies will continue to be profitable and resilient as the economy transitions to clean energy. This is unfair to countless individuals like me who need to protect our savings for the long term. By setting a clear standard for businesses to disclose data about their preparations for the shift to a clean energy economy, as well as actions to address extreme weather and other climate change impacts, this rule will provide investors with the vital information they need to protect our financial futures. I applaud the Commission for addressing major gaps in corporate transparency and fulfilling its mission to protect investors. Although the rule addresses many climate risk transparency problems, it is not strong enough on one in particular: requirements for disclosure of emissions from clients, customers, and suppliers (Scope 3 emissions). While the draft rule likely would require some companies to disclose these emissions, many others would be able to evade key disclosures that investors want and need. The final rule MUST establish a clear Scope 3 disclosure requirement for all large public companies, and require that the accuracy of these disclosures be independently verified. Investors should not be left in the dark about this important source of climate risk. I look forward to the SEC's continued efforts to provide transparency regarding the threats that climate change poses to the savings of investors across our economy. 3,028 of these signers, you might also notice, added their own additional personal comments. If there are any questions about this statement or our positions on this matter do not hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Ben Cushing Campaign Manager, Fossil-Free Finance Sierra Club",
