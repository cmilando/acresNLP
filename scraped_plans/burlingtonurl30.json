This National Research Council report presents an overview ofthe scientific consen- sus about the current and future climate changes affecting U.S.transportation,including the limits of scientific understanding of the timing, magnitude, and location of the effects;identifies the potential impacts on U.S.transportation and the options for adap- tation;and recommends research and actions to prepare for climate change.The report also summarizes previous work on strategies for reducing the transportation-related emissions ofcarbon dioxide—the primary greenhouse gas—which contribute to climate change.

In September 2007, the National Research Council (NRC) released a report examining the U.S. Climate Change Science Program,which oversees federal research on climate change in the United States. The report noted that understanding of the physical climate sys- tem has progressed rapidly but that the use of this knowledge to support decision making,manage risks,and engage stakeholders is inadequate. The transportation sector is a good case in point. Little consensus exists among transportation professionals that climate change is occur- ring or warrants action now. Addressing climate change requires an examination of plausible future scenarios, a long-term perspective, the capacity to deal with uncertain and changing information, and responses that may extend beyond jurisdictional boundaries and trans- portation modal responsibilities. These are significant challenges for transportation professionals. This report is intended to help illuminate the nature of the potential impacts of climate change of greatest rele- vance for U.S. transportation and to suggest appropriate adaptation strategies and organizational responses. ixx Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation This study was requested by the Executive Committee of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) and was conducted with the Division on Earth and Life Studies (DELS).It was funded by a broad range of organizations, including TRB, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program,the U.S.Department ofTransportation (USDOT),the Transit Cooperative Research Program, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. TRB and DELS formed a committee of 13 members comprising experts in climate science, meteorology, transportation planning and engineering, trans- portation operations and maintenance, risk analysis, and economics to conduct the study.1The committee was chaired by Henry G.Schwartz,Jr., retired president and chairman of Sverdrup/Jacobs Civil,Inc.,and mem- ber of the National Academy of Engineering. To carry out its charge, the committee reviewed the literature in the field,requested numerous briefings,commissioned five papers to explore various aspects of the potential impacts of climate change on U.S.trans- portation, and held a 1-day conference to explore these issues with a broader audience. The commissioned papers provided the committee with important information on various aspects of the impacts of climate change on transportation. The first paper, by Thomas C. Peterson, Marjorie McGuirk, Andrew H. Horvitz, and Tamara Houston of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Michael F. Wehner of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, helped set the stage by identifying the climate factors of greatest relevance for trans- portation, summarizing current understanding of projected climate changes for various U.S. regions, and describing potential impacts on transportation.A paper by Michael D. Meyer of the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute ofTechnology exam- ines the role of transportation design standards in light of potential impacts from climate change.A third paper,by Stephen C.Lockwood of Parsons Brinckerhoff, reviews operational strategies for addressing cli- mate change. A fourth paper, by Lance R. Grenzeback of Cambridge Systematics,Inc.,and Andrew Lukmann ofthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology—a case study of the transportation sector’s response to and recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita—examines the vulnerabili- 1George Philander, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, participated as a member of the committee through 2006, when he resigned because of extended foreign travel and new commitments.Preface xi ties and strengths ofvarious transportation modes in the event ofa shock to the system.A final paper,by James A.Dewar and Martin Wachs of the Rand Corporation,2 provides a survey of approaches to decision making under uncertainty,drawing on examples from other sectors and suggest- ing possible new approaches for transportation planning and decision making. The papers were reviewed by the committee and discussants at a 1-day conference (see next paragraph) and revised by the authors.They are listed in Appendix C.Because of their length and printing costs,the papers are available only in electronic form.The reader is cautioned that the inter- pretations and conclusions contained in the papers are those of the authors.The key findings endorsed by the committee appear in the body of the report. The committee recognizes that five papers cannot cover the full range of issues facing the transportation sector as it begins to consider the potential impacts of climate change. Thus, a conference was held midway through the study to examine the papers with a broader audi- ence of climate scientists and academicians and practitioners from all transportation modes and to engage the transportation community in particular in considering the potential impacts of climate change.Each paper was presented and critiqued by a commentator,followed by discus- sion by the authors and invited participants. The conference concluded with a summary by two rapporteurs—one from the climate science and one from the transportation community. Of the 144 individuals invited to the conference, 51 attended. Their names and affiliations, along with the conference agenda, can be found in Appendix D. The commentary and critiques of conference participants were considered in both finaliz- ing the authored papers and preparing this final report. The committee also supplemented its expertise with briefings at its meetings from a wide range of experts. In particular, the committee thanks Eric J. Barron, Distinguished Professor of Geosciences and Dean of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, Pennsylvania State University (now at the University of Texas at Austin), who provided the committee with an overview of the scientific consensus on climate change, continuing uncertainties, and implications for transportation. The committee also thanks Michael Savonis,Team Leader for Air Quality, 2The authors both work for the Rand Corporation, but the paper was prepared by the authors as individuals.xii Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and Joanne Potter, Senior Associate, Cambridge Systematics, Inc., for their briefing on the Gulf Coast Study sponsored by USDOT and the U.S. Geological Survey—an in-depth look at the potential impacts of climate change in this vulnera- ble region;Paul Pisano,Team Leader,FHWA,for his presentation on the U.S. Surface Weather Research Program; Ian Buckle, Director of the Center for Civil Engineering Earthquake Research,University of Nevada at Reno,for his briefing on the development ofearthquake standards and the relevance of this effort to the revision of transportation design stan- dards to address the potential impacts of climate change;Mark Hinsdale, Assistant Vice President, Capacity Management and Network Planning, CSX Corporation, for his overview of the impacts of Hurricane Katrina on rail infrastructure; and Lourdes Maurice, Chief Scientific and Technical Advisor for Environment, and Mohan Gupta, Operations Research Analyst,Federal Aviation Administration,for their overview of potential impacts of climate change on the aviation system. This report has been reviewed in draft form by individuals chosen for their diverse perspectives and technical expertise,in accordance with pro- cedures approved by NRC’s Report Review Committee. The purpose of this independent review is to provide candid and critical comments that assist the authors and NRC in making the published report as sound as possible and to ensure that the report meets institutional standards for objectivity,evidence,and responsiveness to the study charge.The content of the review comments and draft manuscript remain confidential to protect the integrity of the deliberative process.

The earth’s climate is always in a state of flux, but what is of concern today is the rapid rate of change and the unabated contribution of human activity to its occurrence.Many studies have already examined the potential impacts of climate change on broad sectors of the economy, such as agriculture and forestry, but few have studied the impacts on transportation. The primary focus of this report is on the consequences of climate change1 for the infrastructure and operations of U.S.transportation.2 The report provides transportation professionals with an overview ofthe scien- tific consensus on those current and future climate changes of particular relevance to U.S.transportation,including the limitations ofpresent scien- tific understanding as to their precise timing, magnitude, and geographic location;identifies potential impacts on U.S.transportation and adaptation options; and offers recommendations for both research and actions that can be taken to prepare for climate change. The report also summarizes 1Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or its variability over an extended period, typically decades or longer, that can be attributed to either natural causes or human activity. Weather refers to the familiar hour-by-hour, day-by-day changes in temperature, cloudiness, precipitation, and other atmospheric phenomena. 2In this report, infrastructure refers to both transportation networks (e.g., road and rail systems) and facilities (e.g., bridges, tunnels, ports). All modes of transportation are covered—highways (including bridges and tunnels), rail (including private rail lines and public transportation), marine and air transportation, and pipelines. 12 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation previous work on strategies for reducing transportation-related emissions of carbon dioxide (CO )—the primary GHG—that contribute to climate 2 change,a relatively well-researched area (see Appendix B). Climate change will have significant impacts on transportation,affect- ing the way U.S. transportation professionals plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain infrastructure. Decisions taken today, particularly those related to the redesign and retrofitting ofexisting or the location and design ofnew transportation infrastructure,will affect how well the system adapts to climate change far into the future.Focusing on the problem now should help avoid costly future investments and disruptions to operations. The primary objective of this report is to provide guidance for transporta- tion decision makers on how best to proceed. CLIMATE CHANGES OF GREATEST RELEVANCE FOR U.S. TRANSPORTATION Climate change is not just a problem for the future.Recent global climate changes,such as warming temperatures and rising sea levels,likely reflect the effects of GHG emissions into the atmosphere over the past century. Even if drastic measures were taken today to stabilize or eliminate GHG emissions, the effects of climate change would continue to be experi- enced,and U.S.transportation professionals would have to adapt to their consequences. On the basis of current knowledge, climate scientists have identified five climate changes of particular importance to transportation and esti- mated the probability oftheir occurrence during the 21st century (detailed in Box S-1): • Increases in very hot days and heat waves, • Increases in Arctic temperatures, • Rising sea levels, • Increases in intense precipitation events,and • Increases in hurricane intensity. Climate scientists have the greatest confidence in projected changes in mean temperature and other climate factors at the global or continental scale;confidence in these projections diminishes as the geographic scale isSummary 3 BOX S-1 Climate Change Impacts of Greatest Relevance for U.S. Transportation Increases in very hot days and heat waves. It is highly likely (greater than 90 percent probability of occurrence) that heat extremes and heat waves will continue to become more intense, longer lasting, and more frequent in most regions during the 21st century. In 2007, for example, the probabil- ity of having five summer days at or above 43.3°C (110°F) in Dallas was about 2 percent. In 25 years, this probability increases to 5 percent; in 50 years, to 25 percent; and by 2099, to 90 percent. Increases in Arctic temperatures. Arctic warming is virtually certain (greater than 99 percent probability of occurrence), as temperature increases are expected to be greatest over land and at most high northern latitudes. As much as 90 percent of the upper layer of permafrost could thaw under more pessimistic emission scenarios. The greatest temperature increases in North America are projected to occur in the winter in northern parts of Alaska and Canada as a result of feedback effects of shortened periods of snow cover. By the end of the 21st century, projected warming could range from as much as 10.0°C (18.0°F) in the winter to as little as 2.0°C (3.6°F) in the summer in the northernmost areas. On an annual mean temperature basis for the rest of North America, projected warming ranges from 3.0°C to 5.0°C (5.4°F to 9.0°F), with smaller values near the coasts. Rising sea levels.It is virtually certain (greater than 99 percent probability of occurrence) that sea levels will continue to rise in the 21st century as a result of thermal expansion and loss of mass from ice sheets. The projected global range in sea level rise is from 0.18 m (7.1 in.) to 0.59 m (23.2 in.) by 2099, but the rise will not be geographically uniform. The Atlantic and Gulf Coasts should experience a rise near the global mean, the West Coast a slightly lower rise, and the Arctic Coast a rise of only 0.1 m (3.9 in.). These estimates do not include subsidence in the Gulf and uplift along the New England Coast. Nor do the global projections include the full effects of increased melt- ing of the Greenland and Antarctic ice masses because current understanding of these effects is too limited to permit projection of an upper bound on sea level rise. Increases in intense precipitation events.It is highly likely (greater than 90 per- cent probability of occurrence) that intense precipitation events will continue to become more frequent in widespread areas of the United States. (continued)4 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOXS-1 (continued) Climate Change Impacts of Greatest Relevance for U.S. Transportation Increases in hurricane intensity. Increased tropical storm intensities, with larger peak wind speeds and more intense precipitation, are projected as likely (greater than 66 percent probability of occurrence). No robust pro- jections concerning the annual global number of tropical storms have yet emerged from modeling studies, but more detailed analyses focused on the Atlantic Ocean suggest no significant increases in the annual number of Atlantic tropical storms. Note:The primary sources for these data are the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Summary for Policymakers on the Physical Science Basis(Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report); the Peterson et al. 2006 paper commissioned for this study (see Appendix C); numerous other sources that can be found in Chapter 2 (see Table 2-1 and the text discussing each of these impacts); and the committee’s own assessments about the certainty of some impacts, based on the literature. reduced. Nevertheless, climate scientists are now able to project climate changes for large subcontinental regions, such as the eastern United States—a scale better suited to transportation infrastructure, which is regional and local.Projections of future climate are often shown as grad- ual changes, such as the rise in global temperatures projected over this century.However,these changes are unlikely to be experienced in such a smooth manner because those induced by human activity will be ampli- fied in some years by naturally fluctuating conditions, reflected in potentially sudden and dramatic changes at the regional or local level.For example,many climate scientists caution that warming temperatures may trigger weather extremes and surprises,such as more rapid melting of the Arctic sea ice or more rapid rises in sea levels than are projected by cur- rent models. Finding: The past several decades of historical regional climate patterns commonly used by transportation planners to guide their operations and investments may no longer be a reliable guide for future plans.In particular,future climate will include new classes (in terms of magnitude and frequency) of weather and climateSummary 5 extremes,3 such as record rainfall and record heat waves, not experienced in modern times as human-induced changes are superimposed on the climate’s natural variability. POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON TRANSPORTATION Transportation professionals are keenly aware of the effects of weather on system performance. Transportation infrastructure was designed for typical weather patterns,reflecting local climate and incorporating assumptions about a reasonable range oftemperatures and precipitation levels. Finding: Climate change will affect transportation primarily through increases in several types ofweather and climate extremes, such as very hot days; intense precipitation events; intense hurri- canes; drought; and rising sea levels, coupled with storm surges and land subsidence.The impacts will vary by mode oftransporta- tion and region of the country, but they will be widespread and costly in both human and economic terms and will require signif- icant changes in the planning,design,construction,operation,and maintenance of transportation systems. The infrastructure will be affected most by those climate changes that cause environmental conditions to extend outside the range for which the system was designed (see Table S-1 for illustrative impacts ofkey climate changes). Finding: Potentially, the greatest impact of climate change for North America’s transportation systems will be flooding ofcoastal roads, railways, transit systems, and runways because of global rising sea levels, coupled with storm surges and exacerbated in some locations by land subsidence. Fully 53 percent of the U.S.population now lives in counties with coastal regions,many among the most densely populated in the nation.As retire- ment magnets and tourist destinations with rapidly growing economies, coastal communities will continue to experience development pressures, 3The exact threshold for what is classified as an extreme varies from one analysis to another, but an extreme event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the top or bottom 10 percent of all occurrences. For the purposes of this report, all tornadoes and hurricanes are considered extreme.noitatropsnarT no stcapmI evitartsullI dna segnahC etamilC laitnetoP 1-S ELBAT erutcurtsarfnI no stcapmI fo selpmaxE snoitarepO no stcapmI fo selpmaxE egnahC etamilC laitnetoP dna stnioj noisnapxe egdirb no noisnapxe lamrehT -toh ro edutitla-hgih ta stimil daol ffo-tfil no tcapmI syad toh yrev ni sesaercnI secafrus devap ,shtgnel yawnur tneiciffusni htiw stropria rehtaew sevaw taeh dna -netfos ,.g.e( ytirgetni tnemevap gnidrager snrecnoC daolyap no stimil ro snoitallecnac thgilf ni gnitluser diuqil fo noitargim ,gnittur detaler-ciffart ,)gni htob ro ,)snoitcirtser thgiew ,.e.i( tlahpsa ot eud ytivitca noitcurtsnoc fo sdoirep no stimiL seitimrofed kcart-liaR snrecnoc ytefas dna htlaeh ,sdaor fo ecnedisbus gnisuac ,tsorfamrep fo gniwahT eerf-eci erom dna nosaes tropsnart naeco regnoL citcrA ni sesaercnI dna ,senilepip ,)ni-evac( stroppus egdirb ,sdeb liar snoiger nrehtron ni strop serutarepmet snoitadnuof yawnur a ro etuor aes nrehtron a fo ytilibaliava elbissoP sdaor eci rof nosaes retrohS egassap tsewhtron ni syawnur tropria dna ,senil liar ,sdaor fo noitadnunI gniyl-wol dna latsaoc ot snoitpurretni tneuqerf eroM ,slevel aes gnisiR saera latsaoc segrus mrots ot eud ecivres liar dna levart yawdaor mrots htiw denibmoc -nut dnuorgrednu fo gnidoolf ereves ro tneuqerf eroM ro noitaucave gniriuqer ,segrus mrots ereves eroM segrus erutcurtsarfni gniyl-wol dna slen snrettap tnempoleved ni segnahcstroppus egdirb dna esab daor fo noisorE eht fo lareves ta snoitcirtser ro erusolc rof laitnetoP segdirb rednu ecnaraelc decudeR gnitceffa ,senoz latsaoc ni eil taht stropria 05 pot etadommocca ot seitilicaf trop dna robrah ni segnahC eht ni snoitalupop ytisned-tsehgih eht ot ecivres segrus mrots dna sedit rehgih setatS detinU -bus ,senil liar ,syawdaor fo gnidoolf ni sesaercnI ciffart dna syaled detaler-rehtaew ni sesaercnI esnetni ni sesaercnI syawnur dna ,slennut naenarret snoitpursid stneve noitatipicerp -pus deb-liar ot segamad ,tuohsaw daor ni sesaercnI setuor noitaucave fo gnidoolf desaercnI taht sedilsdum dna sedilsdnal dna ,serutcurts trop rehtaew evitcevnoc ot eud syaled enilria ni sesaercnI skcart dna syawdaor egamad -mad dna sdebdaor enilepip fo gniruocs ni sesaercnI senilepip ot ega seruliaf erutcurtsarfni fo ytilibaborp retaerG ecivres ria ni snoitpurretni tneuqerf eroM gnorts tneuqerf eroM skced egdirb fo ytilibats ot taerht desaercnI evisnetxe erom yllaitnetop dna tneuqerf eroM senacirruh egamad evaw morf erutcurtsarfni robrah no stcapmI snoitaucave ycnegreme )5–4 yrogetaC( segrus mrots dna levart gnitpurretni ,senil liar dna sdaor no sirbed eroM gnippihs dna8 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation increasing the exposure of people and businesses to harm from extreme weather.The Atlantic and GulfCoasts are particularly vulnerable because they have already experienced high levels oferosion,land subsidence,and loss of wetlands.Seven of the 10 largest U.S.ports (by tons of traffic),as well as significant oil and gas production facilities,are located on the Gulf Coast,an area whose vulnerability to disruption and damage was amply demonstrated during the 2005 tropical storm season. Sea level rise and coastal flooding also pose risks for the East Coast, as well as the Pacific Northwest and parts of the California Coast. The vulnerability of transportation infrastructure to climate change will extend beyond coastal areas.For example,watersheds supplying water to the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes, as well as the Upper Midwest river system,are likely to experience drier conditions,resulting in lower water levels and reduced capacity to ship agricultural and other bulk commodities,although a longer shipping season could offset some of the adverse economic effects.Thawing permafrost in Alaska is already creating settlement and land subsidence problems for roads,rail lines,runways,and pipelines.Higher temperature extremes (mainly heat waves) in some U.S. regions could lead to more frequent buckling of pavements and misalign- ment of rail lines. More severe weather events with intense precipitation could increase the severity of extensive flooding events,such as the storms that plagued the Midwest during the 1993 flooding of the Mississippi and Missouri River system,the Chicago area in 1996,and the Houston region during Tropical Storm Allison in 2001.Flooding of a waterway system can knock out barge operations on the river itself,rail operations on rights-of- way adjacent to the river,and even highway approaches to bridges crossing flooded rivers. Not all climate change impacts will be negative. For example, the marine transportation sector could benefit from more open seas in the Arctic, creating new and shorter shipping routes and reducing transport time and costs. In cold regions, expected temperature rises, particularly decreases in very cold days and later onset of seasonal freezes and earlier onset ofseasonal thaws,could mean reduced costs ofsnow and ice control for departments of transportation and safer travel conditions for passen- ger vehicles and freight. Recommendation 1:Federal,state,and local governments,in collaboration with owners and operators of infrastructure,Summary 9 such as ports and airports and private railroad and pipeline companies, should inventory critical transportation infra- structure in light ofclimate change projections to determine whether,when,and where projected climate changes in their regions might be consequential. These inventories would need to be updated periodically as new scientific knowledge about climate change becomes available. This would be a relatively low-cost activity because a large portion of the necessary information and tools [e.g., geographic information systems (GIS)] is likely to be available. The inventorying process itself should also help identify with greater precision the data needed from climate scientists on transportation-relevant climate changes. DECISION FRAMEWORK Transportation decision makers have an opportunity now to prepare for projected climate changes. Finding:Public authorities and officials at various governmental levels and executives ofprivate companies are continually making short- and long-term investment decisions that have implications for how the transportation system will respond to climate change in the near and long terms. Recommendation 2:State and local governments and private infrastructure providers should incorporate climate change into their long-term capital improvement plans, facility designs, maintenance practices, operations, and emergency response plans. Taking measures now to evaluate and protect the most vulnerable infrastructure should pay off by diminishing near-term maintenance expenditures and reducing the risk of catastrophic failure,with its toll on human life and economic activity (see Box S-2, which presents a six-step approach for determining appropriate investment priorities). Such mea- sures might include strengthening or elevating some coastal roads,rail lines, and bridges,particularly those that serve as evacuation routes,or upgrad- ing parallel routes where they are available.In the longer term,relocation10 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX S-2 Decision Framework for Transportation Professionals to Use in Addressing Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Infrastructure 1. Assess how climate changes are likely to affect various regions of the country and modes of transportation. 2. Inventory transportation infrastructure essential to maintaining network performance in light of climate change projections to determine whether, when, and where the impacts could be consequential. 3. Analyze adaptation options to assess the trade-offs between making the infrastructure more robust and the costs involved. Consider monitoring as an option. 4. Determine investment priorities, taking into consideration the criticality of infrastructure components as well as opportunities for multiple benefits (e.g., congestion relief, removal of evacuation route bottlenecks). 5. Develop and implement a program of adaptation strategies for the near and long terms. 6. Periodically assess the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and repeat Steps 1 through 5. of rights-of-way farther inland or installation of costly storm barrier sys- tems to protect selected areas (e.g.,parts ofNew York City or Miami) might be considered.Prudent choices today could avoid some of these costs. Finding: The significant costs of redesigning and retrofitting transportation infrastructure to adapt to potential impacts of climate change suggest the need for more strategic, risk-based approaches to investment decisions. Traditionally,transportation decision makers have not taken full advan- tage of quantitative, risk-based approaches that incorporate uncertainty and probabilistic assessments in making investment and design deci- sions. Nor will past trends provide a reliable guide for future plans and designs as they relate to climate. Recommendation 3: Transportation planners and engineers should use more probabilistic investment analyses and designSummary 11 approaches that incorporate techniques for trading off the costs of making the infrastructure more robust against the economic costs offailure.At a more general level,these tech- niques could also be used to communicate these trade-offs to policy makers who make investment decisions and authorize funding. One model is the California Seismic Retrofit Program, which uses a risk- based approach for analyzing vulnerability to earthquakes and the criticality ofhighway bridges to determine priorities for retrofitting and replacement. Adapting such techniques to address climate change will require continuing education of current planners and engineers and training of future profes- sionals.It will also require educating policy makers to gain their support and may well necessitate new eligibility criteria in funding programs and new funding sources so the investments identified by the application of these techniques can be made. DATA AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS Transportation decision makers note that one of the most difficult aspects of addressing climate change is obtaining the relevant informa- tion in the form needed for planning and design purposes.Specifically, as noted earlier,climate change is understood with greatest confidence as a global phenomenon,while transportation planners need local and regional climate projections.They also need a better understanding of how projected climate changes, such as changes in temperature and precipitation, will affect the environment (e.g., soil moisture, runoff) in which the infrastructure is situated, which will vary from region to region. Finding:Transportation professionals often lack sufficiently detailed information about expected climate changes and their timing to take appropriate action. Simply put,transportation professionals,climate scientists,hydrologists, and others have not communicated well. Recommendation 4: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation12 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation (USDOT), the U.S. Geological Survey, and other relevant agencies should work together to institute a process for better communication among transportation professionals, climate scientists, and other relevant scientific disciplines, and estab- lish a clearinghouse for transportation-relevant climate change information. All professions should benefit from the collaboration.Transportation pro- fessionals would be encouraged to define with greater precision the climate data needed to make better transportation decisions,such as tem- perature and precipitation thresholds at finer-grained geographic scales or climate conditions that would create unacceptable performance outcomes. Climate scientists would be challenged to elaborate on the possibilities and limitations ofprojecting the impacts ofclimate change at the levels ofgeo- graphic specificity that are most useful for transportation planners.And hydrologists and others would be challenged to consider how the environ- ment would influence these effects and their impacts on transportation infrastructure. Finding: Better decision support tools are also needed to assist transportation decision makers. Recommendation 5: Ongoing and planned research at fed- eral and state agencies and universities that provide climate data and decision support tools should include the needs of transportation decision makers. For example, the research program of the USDOT Center for Climate Change and Environmental Forecasting could be charged with expanding its existing research program in this area and provided the necessary fund- ing.Needed tools include highly accurate digital elevation maps in coastal areas for forecasting the effects of flooding and storm surge heights; GIS that can be used to map the locations of critical infrastructure, overlaid with information on climate change effects (e.g.,sea level rise,permafrost melt);greater use of scenarios that include climate change in the develop- ment of long-range regional transportation plans to pinpoint likely vulnerabilities and ways to address them; and better network models for examining the systemwide effects of the loss of critical transportation infrastructure links.Summary 13 ADAPTATION OPTIONS Numerous studies have examined ways of mitigating the transportation sector’s contribution to global warming from GHG emissions. Far less attention has been paid to the potential impacts of climate change on U.S. transportation and how transportation professionals can best adapt to cli- mate changes that are already occurring and will continue to occur into the foreseeable future,even if drastic mitigation measures were taken today. Operational Responses Climate extremes and abrupt changes, such as storms and precipitation of increased intensity,will require near-term operational responses from transportation providers. U.S. transportation providers already address the impacts of weather on transportation system operations in a diverse range of climatic conditions.For example,snow and ice control accounts for about 40 percent of annual highway operating budgets in the north- ern states. Likewise, hurricane planning has become a major focus of transportation operations in the Gulf Coast states,where transportation providers are forging close relationships with emergency responders to handle severe weather events. As climate changes induce new extremes, operational responses are likely to become more routine and proactive than today’s approach of treating severe weather on an ad hoc, emergency basis. For example, if hurricanes increase in intensity,as is likely to be the case,establishment of evacuation routes and use of contraflow operations may become as com- monplace as the current use of snow emergency routes in the Northeast and Midwest.More accurate and timely weather prediction and commu- nication of storm warnings in real time to those potentially in harm’s way will become more important. Finding: Projected increases in extreme weather and climate underscore the importance ofemergency response plans in vulner- able locations and require that transportation providers work more closely with weather forecasters and emergency planners and assume a greater role in evacuation planning and emergency response. Recommendation 6: Transportation agencies and service providers should build on the experience in those locations14 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation where transportation is well integrated into emergency response and evacuation plans. Monitoring and Use of Technology Monitoring infrastructure conditions,particularly the impacts of extreme climate changes, offers an alternative to preventive retrofitting or recon- struction of some facilities. In Alaska, for example, the Alyeska Pipeline Company constantly monitors the right-of-way of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to spot land subsidence problems, particularly along the 800 miles of pipeline elevated on vertical supports.Alaskan engineers also closely monitor bridge supports that are experiencing damage from earlier winter runoff and increased stream flow. In the future, sensors and other smart technologies could be embedded in the infrastructure to monitor cli- mate conditions and impacts. Finding: Greater use of technology would enable infrastructure providers to monitor climate changes and receive advance warn- ing of potential failures due to water levels and currents, wave action, winds, and temperatures exceeding what the infrastruc- ture was designed to withstand. Recommendation 7:Federal and academic research programs should encourage the development and implementation of monitoring technologies that could provide advance warning of pending failures due to the effects of weather and climate extremes on major transportation facilities. Sharing of Best Practices As the climate changes,many U.S.locations will experience new climate- induced weather patterns. Finding:The geographic extent ofthe United States—from Alaska to Florida and from Maine to Hawaii—and its diversity ofweather and climate conditions can provide a laboratory for identifying best practices and sharing information as the climate changes. Recommendation 8: The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO),the FederalSummary 15 Highway Administration, the Association of American Railroads,the American Public Transportation Association, the American Association of Port Authorities, the Airport Operators Council,associations for oil and gas pipelines,and other relevant transportation professional and research organizations should develop a mechanism to encourage sharing ofbest practices for addressing the potential impacts ofclimate change. This effort should build on existing technology transfer mechanisms, such as AASHTO’s technology-sharing program. Technology should be defined broadly to include probabilistic decision-making tools,as well as monitoring technologies,new materials,and operating and maintenance strategies. Design Changes Environmental factors are integral to the design of transportation infra- structure. Conditions such as temperature, freeze–thaw cycles, and duration and intensity of precipitation determine subsurface and founda- tion design,choice ofmaterials,and drainage capacity.Engineers,however, have given little thought to whether current design standards are sufficient to accommodate climate change. For example, will drainage capacity be adequate for expected increases in intense precipitation events? Many infra- structure components are currently designed for the 100-year storm—an event ofsuch severity that it occurs,on average,once in 100 years.But pro- jections indicate that what is today’s 100-year precipitation event is likely to occur every 50 or perhaps even every 20 years by the end of the current century.What new materials might be needed when very hot temperatures and heat waves become more frequent? Are infrastructure components sufficiently strong to withstand the forces of larger and more frequent storm surges and more powerful wave action, the effects of which were vividly demonstrated when Hurricane Katrina simply lifted bridge decks off their supporting structures? Finding:Reevaluating,developing,and regularly updating design standards for transportation infrastructure to address the impacts of climate change will require a broad-based research and testing program and a substantial implementation effort.16 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Developing consensus standards is a time-consuming process.Changes in design practices tend to be incremental,and building to higher standards must be weighed against the cost involved.Thus there is a need for a selec- tive,risk-based approach to making changes in standards that focuses first on long-lived facilities,such as bridges and large culverts.A good model is the congressionally mandated National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program,begun in 1977,which established a research effort and a coordi- nation mechanism designed to reduce the risks to life and property from earthquakes through standards that would afford different levels ofprotec- tion for different levels of risk. If a similar program is to be launched to address climate change in a timely manner,it should be initiated soon. Recommendation 9: USDOT should take a leadership role, along with those professional organizations in the forefront of civil engineering practice across all modes,to initiate immedi- ately a federally funded, multiagency research program for ongoing reevaluation of existing and development of new design standards as progress is made in understanding future climate conditions and the options available for addressing them.A research plan and cost proposal should be developed for submission to Congress for authorization and funding of this program. The initial focus should be on essential links in transportation networks, particularly those vulnerable to climate change in coastal or other low- lying areas in riverside locations. Recommendation 10: In the short term, state and federally funded transportation infrastructure rehabilitation projects in highly vulnerable locations should be rebuilt to higher stan- dards,and greater attention should be paid to the provision of redundant power and communications systems to ensure rapid restoration of transportation services in the event of failure. The development of appropriate design standards to accommodate climate change is only one of several possible adaptation strategies. Finding: Federal agencies have not focused generally on adapta- tion in addressing climate change.Summary 17 Recommendation 11: USDOT should take the lead in devel- oping an interagency working group focused on adaptation. This initiative would not necessarily require new funding beyond that rec- ommended above.Better collaboration among agencies could help focus attention on adaptation issues and shape existing research programs. Transportation Planning and Land Use Controls One ofthe most effective strategies for reducing the risks ofclimate change is to avoid placing people and infrastructure in vulnerable locations. Transportation planners currently consider expected land use patterns when forecasting future travel demand and infrastructure needs.However, they rarely question whether such development is desirable, much less what effects climate change might have on the provision and development of infrastructure in vulnerable locations.In part,this situation stems from governance arrangements.States,regional authorities,and the private sec- tor are responsible for large-scale transportation investment decisions,but local governments and a few states control land use decisions through comprehensive plans,zoning ordinances,permitting,and building codes. Finding: Transportation planners are not currently required to consider climate change impacts and their effects on infrastruc- ture investments,particularly in vulnerable locations. Recommendation 12: Federal planning regulations should require that climate change be included as a factor in the devel- opment of public-sector long-range transportation plans; eliminate any perception that such plans should be limited to 20 to 30 years;and require collaboration in plan development with agencies responsible for land use, environmental pro- tection, and natural resource management to foster more integrated transportation–land use decision making. Current surface transportation legislation encourages such collabora- tion.During reauthorization,requiring transportation planners to both consider climate change and collaborate with land use planners in the preparation ofpublic-sector long-range plans could go a long way toward putting these issues on the table.At the same time,any strategy employing land use controls to address climate change would need to build consen-18 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation sus among key decision makers in transportation and land use,probably at the regional level—a challenging proposition. Finding: Locally controlled land use planning, which is typical throughout the country, has too limited a perspective to account for the broadly shared risks of climate change. Insurance Private insurers may be able to accomplish what government cannot in terms of land use control.Some major insurers,for example,are refusing to write new or renew existing homeowners’policies in areas already vul- nerable to hurricanes and other severe storms,which could intensify in a warming climate.Florida,Texas,Louisiana,Mississippi,Hawaii,New York City, and Long Island are among the areas affected thus far. Some states have stepped up to become insurers of last resort for coastal homes and businesses,but the high costs ofproviding coverage are unlikely to be sus- tainable.Moreover,the provision of insurance in hazard-prone areas that is not actuarially based is bad public policy. The federal government is the insurer of last resort for homeowners in specially designated flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program ofthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides homeowners with below-cost insurance. In return, the local community must adopt and enforce floodplain management measures, including building code ordinances for new construction and rebuilding after a dis- aster,to reduce flood damage.Critics contend that in practice,the program has resulted in more development than would otherwise have occurred in these areas.Moreover,the accuracy of flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) used to determine program eligibility is woefully inadequate, despite a mapping modernization program.Flood hazard area boundaries are keyed to the 100-year storm,and base elevation data are inadequate. Finding:The National Flood Insurance Program and the FIRMs used to determine program eligibility do not take climate change into account. Recommendation 13:FEMA should reevaluate the risk reduc- tion effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program and the FIRMs,particularly in view of projected increases inSummary 19 intense precipitation and storms. At a minimum, updated flood zone maps that account for sea level rise (incorporating land subsidence) should be a priority in coastal areas. New Organizational Arrangements The impacts of climate change do not follow modal,corporate,or jurisdic- tional boundaries, yet decision making in the transportation sector is structured around these boundaries.Transportation planning is conducted primarily at the regional level,often through a bottom-up process that starts with local jurisdictions.Railroads,trucking,and waterborne commerce are largely private enterprises with varying levels offederal participation.Thus, existing institutional arrangements are not well suited to addressing cli- mate change.Some models of cross-jurisdictional cooperation exist,such as regional authorities for specific facilities (e.g.,the Alameda Corridor) and multistate emergency response agreements.In addition,there are models of state-mandated regional authorities, as is the case for regional air quality improvement authorities.Organizational arrangements suited to address- ing the impacts of climate change may require state or federal action. Finding: Current institutional arrangements for transportation planning and operations were not organized to address climate change and may not be adequate for the purpose. Recommendation 14: Incentives incorporated in federal and state legislation should be considered as a means of address- ing and mitigating the impacts of climate change through regional and multistate efforts. For example,states could use updated FIRMs or their own state maps to identify geographic areas vulnerable to climate change and craft policies for restricting transportation investments and limiting insurance in these locations. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS The committee finds compelling scientific evidence that climate change is occurring and that it will trigger new, extreme weather events and could possibly lead to surprises,such as more rapid than expected rises in20 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation sea levels or temperature changes. Every mode of transportation will be affected as climate change poses new and often unfamiliar challenges to infrastructure providers. The committee urges that the transportation community start now to confront these challenges. A strong federal role is needed to implement many of the committee’s recommendations that require broad-based action or regulation, such as creation of a clearinghouse for information on transportation and climate change, the research program to reevaluate existing and develop new design standards for addressing climate change,creation of an interagency working group on adaptation, changes in federal regulations regarding long-range planning guidelines and infrastructure rehabilitation require- ments,and reevaluation of the National Flood Insurance Program. Many of the committee’s recommendations, however, need not await federal action.Local governments and private infrastructure providers can begin to identify critical infrastructure that is particularly vulnerable to cli- mate change. Professional organizations can begin to amass examples of best practice, and planners and climate scientists at local universities and research institutes can begin to collaborate on the development ofregional scenarios of likely transportation-related climate changes and the data needed to analyze their impacts.The most important step,however,is for transportation professionals to acknowledge that the time has come to confront the challenges posed by climate change and to incorporate the most current scientific knowledge into the planning,design,construction, operation,and maintenance of transportation systems.1 Introduction C limate scientists are projecting changes in the global climate with potentially profound impacts on agriculture and forest productivity, ecosystems, water resources, and energy, as well as related socioeconomic effects.1 Increases in annual globally averaged mean temperatures, in the number of warm days and nights over mid- and high-latitude land areas, and in temperature and precipitation extremes all are projected to occur with a high degree of confidence2 during the 21st century. These changes will bring about the retreat of sea ice and the thawing of glaciers and ice caps, particularly at high northern latitudes; rising sea levels; and greater flooding and higher storm surges along vulnerable coastal and riverine areas.The finer the geographic resolution and the longer the temporal pro- jections, the greater are the uncertainties surrounding estimates of future climate change.The respective roles of human and natural causes in these changes have now been well established (IPCC 2007b). Numerous studies have examined the link between climate change and the transportation sector. These studies have been conducted primarily 1Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or its variability over an extended period, typically decades or longer, that can be attributed to either natural causes or human activity (IPCC 2007a). This definition is drawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was jointly established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme in 1988 to assess the available scientific and socioeconomic information on climate change and its impacts and on options for mitigating those impacts and developing adaptive responses. 2 Climate scientists express uncertainty in a variety of ways. To encourage greater uniformity in communicating uncertainty, lead authors of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report were provided guidance on how to treat issues of uncertainty and statistical confidence in a consistent manner (IPCC 2005). The term “high degree of confidence” means consistency across model projections and/or consistency with theory and/or changes in the mean. See Chapter 2 for a more detailed discussion of uncertainty. 2122 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation from the perspective of transportation’s contribution to global warming through the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide (CO ) 2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere.3CO from com- 2 bustion of fossil fuels is the largest source of U.S.GHG emissions.In 2005, the most recent year for which data are available,the transportation sector accounted for 33 percent of U.S. CO emissions from fossil fuel combus- 2 tion,4exceeded only by electricity generation by the electric power industry at 41 percent (USEPA 2007, Table 3-7).5 CO emissions from U.S. trans- 2 portation activities are expected to increase over the next several decades, primarily as a result ofgrowth in road travel,fueled by population and eco- nomic growth (World Business Council for Sustainable Development 2004). However, these emissions are likely to be regulated. In a landmark decision in April 2007 (Massachusetts et al., Petitioners, v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate GHG emissions and that CO can be construed as an air 2 pollutant under the statute. Far less attention has been paid to the consequences ofpotential climate changes for U.S.transportation infrastructure and operations.6,7For exam- ple, projected rising sea levels, flooding, and storm surges could swamp marine terminal facilities,airport runways near coastlines,subway and rail- road tunnel entrances, and roads and bridges in low-lying coastal areas. 3 CO and other GHGs allow sunlight to enter and prevent heat from leaving the earth’s atmosphere— 2 the so-called greenhouse effect, loosely analogous to the operation of a greenhouse window. Higher concentrations of CO and other GHGs than occur naturally trap excess heat in the atmosphere and 2 warm the earth’s surface (Staudt et al. 2005). 4 Emissions from combustion of both aviation and marine international bunker fuels (i.e., fuel loaded on transport vehicles in the United States but consumed in international operations) are excluded from this total. See Appendix B for a more detailed discussion of the transportation sector’s contribution in general, and the U.S. contribution in particular, to worldwide GHG emissions, particularly emissions of CO from fuel combustion. 2 5 The total is larger if emissions from the extraction, production, and distribution of transport fuels and from the manufacture, distribution, and disposal of transportation vehicles are summed to produce a total life-cycle emissions estimate (see the discussion in Appendix B). 6 In this report, infrastructure refers to both transportation networks (e.g., road and rail systems) and facilities (e.g., bridges, tunnels, ports). 7 In fact, a recent assessment of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) found that the scientific community is not well structured to develop information that would enable adaptive response for any sector in the United States (NRC 2007). The CCSP integrates federal research on climate and global change, as sponsored by 13 federal agencies.Introduction 23 Across the northern portions ofthe contiguous United States,warmer tem- peratures and reduced lake ice will likely lead to increased evaporation from bodies of water and their surrounding watersheds,potentially lower- ing lake and river levels and reducing vessel-carrying capacity. Shipping across the Great Lakes and the Upper Midwest river system would thereby be impaired, although a longer shipping season would offset some of the adverse economic effects.Thawing permafrost in Alaska is already creating settlement and land subsidence problems for roads, rail lines, runways, and pipelines.Greater temperature extremes (mainly heat waves) in some U.S.regions could lead to buckling ofpavements and misalignment ofrail lines. More intense precipitation could increase the severity of flooding events, such as the storms that plagued the Midwest during the flooding of the Mississippi River in 1993 and the Chicago area in 1996. More intense tropical storms, like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005,are likely to become more frequent.However,no significant increases in the annual number of Atlantic tropical storms are projected. The vulnerability8ofthe transportation sector to these impacts has not been thoroughly studied,nor has it been widely considered by transporta- tion planners and decision makers in planning, designing, constructing, retrofitting, and operating the transportation infrastructure. Many trans- portation professionals are unaware of the problems climate change could create.Others are hesitant to take action in view ofthe uncertain outcomes and long time frames involved and the lack of clear guidelines and stan- dards for addressing the effects of climate change and related hazards. STUDY CHARGE, SCOPE, AND AUDIENCE The Executive Committee of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) requested and provided funding for this study, which was undertaken jointly with the Division on Earth and Life Studies of the National 8 One in-depth assessment of impacts in the Gulf Coast region, entitled Impacts of Climate Change and Variability on Transportation Systems and Infrastructure: Gulf Coast Study,was ongoing during the course of this study. It became available for public comment only after the committee had completed its deliberations. The public review version of the Gulf Coast study can be accessed at www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap4-7/public-review-draft/default.htm.24 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Academies. The expert committee formed to conduct the study was charged9 to • Provide federal,state,and local transportation officials in the United States with an overview of the scientific consensus regarding climate change,including uncertainty about its nature and extent; • Summarize previous work on strategies for reducing transporta- tion’s impact on climate change; • Summarize possible impacts on transportation,such as those due to rising sea levels,higher mean temperatures with less extreme low temperatures and more heat extremes,and more frequent intense precipitation events; • Analyze options for adapting to these impacts,including the possi- ble need to alter assumptions about infrastructure design and operations,the ability to incorporate uncertainty into long-range decision making,and the capability of institutions to plan and act on mitigation and adaptation strategies at the state and regional levels; • Identify critical areas for research;and • Suggest policies and actions for preparing for the potential impacts of climate change. The committee’s charge can be viewed more broadly as a risk manage- ment problem with hazards to address (potential impacts of climate change) and vulnerable10 assets to protect (transportation infrastructure). Seen in this framework, the objective is to minimize risk by reducing the hazards (i.e.,identify mitigation measures to reduce the potential effects of climate change) and protecting the assets (i.e., identify adaptation mea- 9 A more detailed statement of task is included as Appendix A. 10 In this report, the term “vulnerability” is defined as “the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity” (IPCC 2007a, 21). The committee notes that there is a large literature on vulnerability as it relates to many hazards and cites Turner et al. (2003) as an example of a broad vulnerability framework and its application to several different types of hazards and affected communities in case studies.Introduction 25 sures11 to strengthen the infrastructure and increase its resilience to changing climate conditions through more stringent design standards and construction codes and retrofitting or relocation of at-risk facilities).12 The primary focus ofthis report is on adaptation strategies rather than on strategies to mitigate transportation-related GHG emissions.The topic of adaptation, particularly as it relates to transportation, has not received the attention or research effort devoted to the issue of mitigation. In- vestigating both topics fully was beyond the resources available for this study. In fact, at the time of this writing, TRB had initiated a new study focused entirely on mitigation.13 Nevertheless, in response to its charge and drawing heavily on existing studies,committee member George Eads, with the consensus of the full committee, summarized current and pro- jected contributions of the transportation sector to GHG emissions and examined numerous technological and nontechnological mitigation strategies (see Appendix B).The analysis did not attempt to pick winners and losers by comparing the costs and benefits of alternative mitigation approaches.Indeed,the data for doing so were not available.That level of analysis would require a separate study or even a series of studies. The committee was mindful of the potential interaction between miti- gation and adaptation strategies as shown in Figure 1-1.For example,ifthe fuel consumption and CO emissions and concentrations oftransportation 2 vehicles could be substantially reduced by the introduction of new tech- nologies, this would lessen the human-caused contribution to climate change and its impacts on transportation infrastructure. Reductions in travel demand or shifts to less GHG-emitting travel modes (e.g., public transit for personal travel and rail for freight travel) would operate in a sim- ilar fashion.The summary of Appendix B notes,however,that a common 11 Adaptation strategies refer to human attempts to protect or adapt systems so as to reduce the risks and moderate the potential harm from and exploit the beneficial opportunities of the impacts of climate change. Mitigation strategies refer to human intervention to reduce the sources of GHGs that contribute to climate change. 12 Until researchers can quantify both the severity of expected outcomes and their probabilities, however, a full risk assessment is not possible. 13 The study on potential energy savings and GHG reductions will review policies and strategies to affect behavior and improve fuel economy for passenger and freight vehicles across all modes; develop scenarios to illustrate potential savings over a 25- to 50-year time horizon for the United States; and analyze the safety, economic, transportation finance, and environmental consequences of energy-saving measures.26 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Adaptation Strategies Greenhouse Gas Impacts on U.S. Polic ies/ Emissions and Transportation Actions Concentrations Infrastructure Mitigation Measures FIGURE 1-1 Role of mitigation measures and adaptation strategies in addressing climate change impacts on U.S. transportation infrastructure. (Bolded areas denote the primary focus of this study.) characteristic of these mitigation measures is the considerable time they would take to be fully effective14 and the fact that they would affect only future GHG emissions and concentration levels.Complementary adapta- tion strategies are thus essential ifthe transportation sector is to address the consequences ofGHG emissions and concentration levels that have already occurred. The report begins with an overview of the current state of knowledge about climate change and its potential impacts,with a particular focus on North America, to set the stage for assessing the consequences for the transportation sector and identifying prudent adaptation strategies.The objective of this review is not to advance the state of climate science but stcapmI ecudeR Climate Mediating Changes Environmental Effects Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations 14 The appendix notes that the time required to develop, commercialize, and disseminate new vehicle technologies is probably shorter than the time required to alter the fundamental drivers of demand for personal and freight transport—growth in real income, population growth, urbanization, and changes in urban form. Nevertheless, both new technology and shifts in demand are needed if future levels of transportation-related GHG emissions—a major source of total GHG emissions— are to be significantly reduced.Introduction 27 to inform transportation professionals about climate change—including uncertainty as to its precise timing and geographic locations—so they can begin to consider appropriate responses. The report encompasses all modes of transportation—highways (including bridges and tunnels), rail (including private rail lines and public transportation), marine and air transportation, and pipelines. Its primary focus is on the direct impacts of climate change on transporta- tion infrastructure and system operating performance,although indirect impacts are noted (e.g.,potential shifts in the location ofeconomic activ- ities and use of transportation modes,pollution impacts).These indirect impacts are highly uncertain because they depend on assumptions about population and economic growth, the rate of technological innovation, and policy decisions (e.g.,government regulations and controls on coastal land use and development,private-sector decisions about business oper- ations and logistics). The geographic scope of the study is confined to the United States but extends beyond the contiguous 48 states to include Alaska,Hawaii,and the U.S.territories.15The range of weather and climate conditions16embraced by this area is broad—from the permafrost conditions of Alaska to the tropical conditions ofPuerto Rico and Hawaii.Thus,the United States can expect a wide range of climate changes and their impacts.International studies were reviewed for techniques and approaches that might be appro- priate to the United States.However,the committee found few studies that address the impact of climate change on transportation and adaptation strategies. The audience for this report is the transportation community broadly defined. The overall goal of the report is to demonstrate to decision makers responsible for transportation infrastructure—both public and private—why they should plan for climate change.At the same time,an attempt is made to moderate expectations about the level of precision with which the report can provide guidance on specific impacts of cli- mate change and their time frames. 15 Information on climate change effects and impacts, however, is not always available for smaller geographic areas. 16 Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or its variability over an extended period, typically decades or longer, that can be attributed to either natural causes or human activity. Weather refers to the familiar hour-by-hour, day-by-day changes in temperature, cloudiness, precipitation, and other atmospheric phenomena.28 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation WHY CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS When asked to consider climate change, transportation professionals fre- quently protest that dealing with a problem whose time horizon is decades and centuries and whose effects are uncertain is impractical. Moreover, they maintain, resources are insufficient to address day-to-day mainte- nance problems, much less to make investments on the basis of changes that may or may not occur years or even generations into the future. So why should transportation professionals take note of climate change? First,it is not just a problem for the future.Recent changes,such as global warming and resulting sea level rises,reflect the effects of GHG emissions that were released into the atmosphere over the past century. What appears to be new is the greater certainty of scientists that human activity is already warming the climate and that the rate ofchange is likely to be greater than at any time in modern history (IPCC 2007b). Second, climate change will not necessarily occur gradually. Climate scientists expect that higher temperatures will be amplified by normal vari- ability in climate, leading to new extremes far outside current experience [e.g.,the heat wave in Europe in 2003 (Stott et al.2004) and the near record heat of 2006 in the United States (Hoerling et al.2007)].Higher tempera- tures are also likely to trigger surprises,such as more rapid than expected melting ofArctic sea ice and rising sea levels. Third, although transportation professionals typically plan 20 to 30 years into the future,many decisions taken today,particularly about the location of infrastructure,help shape development patterns and mar- kets that endure far beyond these planning horizons. Similarly, decisions about land use, zoning, and development often create demand for long- lived transportation infrastructure investments. Thus, it is important for transportation decision makers to consider potential impacts of climate change now in making these investment choices because those impacts will affect how well the infrastructure adapts to climate change. Fourth, professionals in many fields—among them finance, building (where protecting against earthquakes,wildfires,or wind risk is a concern), nuclear power, and water resources (in the design of dams and canals)— are continually making decisions in the face of uncertain information about risks and outcomes. In fact, the highway and bridge engineering community, through the auspices of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials,has developed design guidelines andIntroduction 29 standards for earthquake resistance on the basis ofprobabilistic seismic haz- ard assessments that take many uncertainties into account. Similarly, addressing climate change requires more quantitative assessments,such as the development of probabilistic climate change scenarios at the level of geographic and modal specificity needed by transportation planners and engineers, which can be incorporated into planning forecasts and engi- neering design guidelines and standards. Finally, transportation professionals already consider weather- and climate-related factors in designing and operating the transportation infrastructure. For example, many transportation networks and facilities are designed with adequate drainage and pumping capacity to handle a 100-year storm.17Materials and maintenance cycles are geared to assump- tions about temperature and precipitation levels. Evacuation plans and routes have been identified in hurricane- and other storm-prone locations on the basis of current elevations and assumptions about storm surges and wave action.But what if the 100-year storm were to become the 50- or 30-year storm,or design thresholds were frequently to be exceeded,or evacuation routes themselves were to become vulnerable (see Box 1-1)? Such changes could necessitate different design criteria,asset management policies,maintenance cycles,and operating strategies.Recent severe weather events—such as the Mississippi River floods of1993,Category 3 or greater hurricanes (e.g., Ivan, Katrina, Rita), the California wildfires of 2003— provide ample opportunities for transportation professionals to observe the vulnerabilities of the infrastructure to shocks to the system that could become more commonplace in the future. They also illustrate the dilemma facing transportation decision makers of whether to rebuild, rebuild differently,or relocate critical transportation infrastructure. STUDY APPROACH AND KEY ISSUES A wide range of climate changes could affect transportation infrastruc- ture and result in changes in the way U.S. transportation professionals plan, design, operate, and maintain the infrastructure. The committee adapted a figure from a workshop conducted by the U.S.Department of 17 A 100-year storm is defined as the amount of rainfall during a specified length of time that has a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year or, put another way, has a recurrence interval of 100 years.30 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX 1-1 What If? • What if design lives for infrastructure and return periods were to be exceeded routinely? Many facilities are built to withstand a 100-year storm. The design of other facilities, such as bridges, assumes a 50-year storm and does not take into account the effect of wave action, vividly illustrated by Hurricane Katrina (Meyer 2006). What if the 50-year storm, or even the 100-year storm, were to be exceeded routinely, reducing pro- jected recurrence periods to much below one in 50 or one in 100 years? • What if multiple severe weather events were to occur? Each year, Florida and the Gulf Coast brace for hurricanes, and California prepares for wild- fires or heavy rains. Emergency personnel are generally able to handle these events, and transportation managers find alternative routes to keep freight moving, largely because the events occur sequentially and at rel- atively infrequent intervals. But consider the impact of a Category 4 or 5 hurricane directed at Houston and its critical petrochemical infrastruc- ture at the same time that torrential rains and mudslides prevent access to the Port of Los Angeles. How would emergency responders and the economy fare in the face of multiple and simultaneous intense storms that climate change could bring with greater frequency? • What if critical evacuation routes were themselves to become sub- merged by rising seas and storm surge? Population increases in coastal areas are projected to more than double in the next 20 years. Many sea- side communities count on coastal highways for evacuation in a major storm. Some of these highways also act as flood barriers. What if the current accelerating rate of sea level rise were to continue into the fore- seeable future? Highways in low-lying areas that provide a vital lifeline could themselves become compromised by encroaching seas and storm surge. Some communities could be cut off in a severe storm or would be forced to evacuate well in advance of the storm’s known trajectory to avoid that risk. In the longer term, it may be possible to relocate some coastal highways farther inland and still provide a means of egress for vulnerable communities.Introduction 31 Transportation (USDOT 2003) on the potential impacts of climate change on transportation (Potter and Savonis 2003) to provide a concep- tual framework for this study (Figure 1-2). The first task is to identify potential climate change effects, focusing on those of greatest relevance for transportation (see Column 1). This task also includes indicating what is known from climate scientists about the certainty ofthese effects, particularly at the regional and local levels, and the time frame over which they are likely to unfold. The second task (see Column 2) involves describing the impacts of the effects of climate change on transportation.These impacts can be consid- ered in several different ways—by type of climate change effect (e.g., sea level rise, temperature extremes), by transportation mode, by geographic area, and by type of impact. With regard to the latter, impacts on trans- portation can be direct (i.e.,affecting the physical infrastructure as well as 1. Potential Climate 2. Impacts on U.S. 3.

[Note in Column 2 that the impacts of climate change on U.S. transportation infrastructure will be influenced by the environment in which the infrastructure is located (e.g., soil moisture, stream flow), which will vary from region to region.] (Source: Adapted from Potter and Savonis 2003, 29.)32 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation the operating performance of the system) or indirect (e.g., affecting the location ofeconomic activities or levels ofpollution).Finally,these impacts will be influenced by changes in the environment in which the infrastruc- ture is situated.For example,changes in temperature and precipitation will affect soil moisture and runoff,which in turn will affect peak stream flows, sediment delivery to coasts, and the sustainability of the landforms upon which the infrastructure is built,with considerable regional variability.The tasks listed in Columns 1 and 2 require good communication among cli- mate scientists, transportation professionals, and other relevant scientific disciplines. The final task (see Column 3) requires developing possible adaptation strategies.A range ofapproaches is suggested—from the identification of at-risk critical infrastructure,to the monitoring ofconditions (both climate and infrastructure),to changes in operating and maintenance practices,to changes in infrastructure design and redesign,to relocation of vulnerable infrastructure.The strategies listed in this column require action primar- ily by transportation decision makers—planners,designers,engineers,and operating and maintenance personnel. Figure 1-2 links together potential climate change effects, impacts on U.S.transportation infrastructure,and possible adaptation strategies,but it does not fully address several key points.First,issues of scale affect the certainty with which the effects ofclimate change on transportation infra- structure can be examined at present.Climate change projections are most accurate at the global level, but transportation infrastructure is largely local and regional.Nevertheless,the ability to predict climate change at the local and regional levels is improving. Furthermore, the effects of climate change are not point specific;their impacts may differ even within a region, depending on location.For example,sea level rise will affect coastal regions, but the seriousness of the impact will depend on the elevation,the amount of land subsidence,and the extent of protection (e.g.,levees) provided and the redundancy of vulnerable infrastructure in the affected areas. The network character of transportation infrastructure adds another layer ofcomplexity.Adverse impacts ofclimate change on transportation facilities in one region,for example,may shift activity to another location or route,either temporarily,as was the case for freight movement in the wake ofHurricane Katrina,or in the longer term (e.g.,shifts in port activ- ity resulting from new shipping routes opening as a result of warming and deepening seas),with net effects that may be positive or negative.Introduction 33 Differences in time frames are another complicating factor. Some cli- mate changes will unfold over decades and centuries, ostensibly allowing time for transportation decision makers to plan and respond.Others are likely to increase the sensitivity of the climate system and could bring surprises and abrupt changes that would make planning difficult.18 The lifetime of transportation infrastructure can be as little as 10 to 20 years (e.g., some pavement surfaces), allowing engineers to adapt to some cli- mate changes as they unfold. Many other transportation networks and facilities are longer-lived. Major bridges and pipelines, for example, have lifetimes of50 to 100 years,while the right-of-way ofmajor transportation networks (e.g.,rail lines,roads) is easily that long-lived.Thus,many of the investment decisions made by transportation professionals today will have a significant effect on how well the infrastructure adapts to climate change. Finally, like so many other problems, climate change will not be experienced in isolation. It will manifest itself in the context of other demographic,social,and economic trends,often aggravating existing con- ditions.For example,many coastal areas are likely to experience increased development pressures as a result of population growth,greater affluence, and tourist demands.Many ofthese areas are already vulnerable to erosion and storm damage.As sea levels rise with global warming,coastal storms with higher tides and storm surges are likely to create the conditions for more severe coastal flooding and erosion, placing more people in harm’s way and increasing the difficulty of evacuating in an emergency. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT The remainder of this report addresses the committee’s charge.Chapter 2 reviews the current state of knowledge about climate change, including projected changes over the next century, and those factors of particular relevance to U.S. transportation. Chapter 3 is focused on the potential impacts ofclimate changes on transportation infrastructure.The chapter begins with an overview ofthe vulnerability ofthe infrastructure to these changes; it then examines the likely impacts of the most critical climate changes by transportation mode,reviews the handful ofstudies that have examined the impacts of climate change on transportation,and draws a 18 Evidence exists for abrupt climate changes that can occur within a decade.

Chapter 4 describes how the transportation sector is organized and explains why climate change poses a difficult challenge to decision makers.It concludes with some suggestions for a more strategic, risk-based approach to investment decisions. Chapter 5 considers adap- tation strategies—both engineering and operational measures,as well as changes in transportation planning and land use controls, development of new technologies, improved data and analysis tools, and organiza- tional changes. In the sixth and final chapter, the committee offers its recommendations for policies and actions to address the impacts of cli- mate change on transportation and for needed research.

For each climate variable, past projections and key uncertainties are also discussed. The chapter ends with a series of findings. OVERVIEW OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE The Greenhouse Effect and Atmospheric Composition The natural “greenhouse”effect is real and is an essential component ofthe planet’s climatic processes.A small proportion (roughly 2 percent) of the atmosphere is, and long has been, composed of GHGs (water vapor, car- bon dioxide,ozone,and methane).These gases effectively prevent part of the heat radiated by the earth’s surface from otherwise escaping to space. The response of the global system to this trapped heat is a climate that is warmer than it would be without the presence of these gases; in their 36Understanding Climate Change 37 absence, the earth’s temperature would be too low to support life as we know it.Among the GHGs,water vapor is by far the most dominant,but other gases augment its effect through greater trapping of heat in certain portions of the electromagnetic (light) spectrum. In addition to the natural greenhouse effect outlined above,a change is under way in the greenhouse radiation balance.Some GHGs are prolif- erating in the atmosphere because of human activities and increasingly trapping more heat.Direct atmospheric measurements made over the past 50 years have documented steady growth in the atmospheric abundance of carbon dioxide (CO ).In addition to these direct,real-time measurements, 2 ice cores have revealed the atmospheric CO concentrations of the distant 2 past.Measurements using air bubbles trapped within layers of accumulat- ing snow show that atmospheric CO has increased by nearly 35 percent 2 over the Industrial Era (since 1750),compared with its relatively constant abundance over at least the preceding 10,000 years (see Figure 2-1). The predominant causes of this increase in CO are the combustion of fossil 2 fuels and deforestation. Further, the abundance of methane has doubled over the Industrial Era, although its increase has slowed during the past decade for reasons not clearly understood. Other heat-trapping gases are also increasing as a result of human activities.Scientists are unable to state with certainty the rate at which these GHGs will continue to increase because ofuncertainties in future emissions,as well as in how these emis- sions will be taken up by the atmosphere, land, and oceans. They are certain,however,that once in the atmosphere,these gases have a relatively long residence time, on the order of a century (IPCC 2001). This means they become well mixed across the globe. There is no doubt that the composition of the atmosphere is affected by human activities. Today GHGs are the largest human influence on atmospheric composition. The increase in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere implies a positive radiative forcing (i.e.,a tendency to warm the climate system). Increases in heat-trapping GHGs are projected to be amplified by feed- back effects, such as changes in water vapor, snow cover, and sea ice. As atmospheric concentrations ofCO and other GHGs increase,the resulting 2 rise in surface temperature leads to less sea ice and snow cover,causing the planet to absorb more of the sun’s energy rather than reflecting it back to space, thereby raising temperatures even further. Present evidence also suggests that as GHGs lead to rising temperatures, evaporation38 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation FIGURE 2-1 Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide over the past 10,000 years (large panels) and since 1750 (inset panels). Measurements are from a combination of ice cores (going back 10,000 years) and atmospheric samples in the 20th century. (Source:IPCC 2007, Figure SPM-1, p. 15. Reprinted with permission of the IPCC Secretariat, Geneva, Switzerland.)Understanding Climate Change 39 increases, leading to more atmospheric water vapor (Soden et al. 2005; Trenberth et al.2005).Additional water vapor,the dominant GHG,acts as a very important feedback to increase temperature further.The most uncer- tain feedback is related to clouds, specifically changes in cloud frequency, location,and height.The range ofuncertainty spans from a significant pos- itive feedback to no feedback,or even a slightly negative feedback.Present understanding suggests that these feedback effects account for at least half of the climate’s warming (IPCC 2001;Karl and Trenberth 2003).The exact magnitude of these effects remains a significant source of uncertainty in understanding the impact of increasing GHGs. Increases in evaporation and water vapor affect global climate in other ways besides causing rising temperatures,such as increasing rainfall and snowfall rates and accelerating drying during droughts. Particles suspended in the atmosphere (aerosols) resulting from human activities can also affect climate.Aerosols vary considerably by region.Some aerosol types (e.g.,sulfate) act in a way opposite to the GHGs by reflecting more solar radiation back to space than the heat they absorb,and thereby causing a negative radiative forcing or cooling ofthe climate system.Other aerosols (e.g.,soot) act in the same way as GHGs and warm the climate.In contrast to the long-lived nature of CO , aerosols are short-lived and 2 removed from the lower atmosphere within a few days.Therefore,human- generated aerosols exert a long-term forcing on climate only because their emissions continue each day of the year.The effects of aerosols on climate can be manifested directly by their ability to reflect and trap heat,but also indirectly by changes in the lifetime of clouds and in the clouds’reflectiv- ity to sunshine. The magnitude of the negative forcing of the indirect effects ofaerosols is highly uncertain,but it may be larger than that oftheir direct effects (IPCC 2001). Emissions of GHGs and aerosols continue to alter the atmosphere by influencing the planet’s natural energy flows (see Box 2-1),which can cause changes in temperature and precipitation extremes, reductions in snow cover and sea ice,changes in storm tracks,and increased intensity of hur- ricanes (IPCC 2007). There are also natural factors that exert a forcing effect on climate [e.g.,changes in the sun’s energy output and short-lived (a few years) aerosols in the stratosphere following episodic and explosive volcanic eruptions].Ifall the possible influences ofnatural and human cli- mate forcings over the past several decades are considered, increases in GHGs have had a larger influence on the planet’s radiation flow than all the40 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX 2-1 What Warms and Cools the Earth? The sun is the earth’s main energy source. Its output appears nearly constant, but small changes during an extended period of time can lead to climate changes. In addition, slow changes in the earth’s orbit affect how the sun’s energy is distributed across the earth, creating another variable that must be considered. Greenhouse gases warm the earth: Water vapor (H O), supplied from oceans and the natural biosphere, 2 accounts for two-thirds of the total greenhouse effect but acts primarily as a feedback. In contrast to other greenhouse gases, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere generally cannot be controlled by humans. Water vapor introduced directly into the atmosphere from agricultural or other activities does not remain there very long and is overwhelmed by natural sources; thus it has little warming effect. Carbon dioxide (CO ) has natural and human sources. CO levels are 2 2 increasing as a result of the burning of fossil fuels. Methane (CH )has both human and natural sources and has risen signif- 4 icantly since preindustrial times as the result of an increase in several human activities, including raising of livestock; growing of rice; use of landfills; and extraction, handling, and transport of natural gas. Ozone (O ) has natural sources, especially in the stratosphere, where 3 changes caused by ozone-depleting chemicals have been important; ozone also is produced in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmo- sphere) when hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide pollutants react. Nitrous oxide (N O) has been increasing from agricultural and industrial 2 sources. Halocarbons continue to be used as substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as refrigerant fluids, and CFCs from pre–Montreal Protocol usage as refrigerants and as aerosol-package propellants remain in the atmosphere. Scientists have a high level of understanding of the human contributions to climate forcing by carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and CFCs and a medium level of understanding of the human contributions to climate forcing by ozone (Forster et al. 2007). (continued)Understanding Climate Change 41 Some aerosols (airborne particles and droplets) warm the earth: Black carbon particles, or “soot,”produced when fossil fuels or vegetation is burned, generally have a warming effect by absorbing solar radiation. Some aerosols cool the earth: Sulfate (SO ) aerosols from burning of fossil fuels reflect sunlight back 4 to space. Volcanic eruptions emit gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO ), which, once in the at- 2 mosphere, forms SO aerosols and ash. Both reflect sunlight back to space. 4 Scientists currently have a low level of understanding of the human contri- butions to climate forcing by aerosols (Forster et al. 2007). Changes in land cover, ice extent, and cloud cover can warm or cool the earth: Deforestationproduces land areas that reflect more sunlight back to space; replacement of tundra by coniferous trees that create dark patches in the snow cover may increase absorption of sunlight. Sea ice reflects sunlight back to space; reduction in the extent of sea ice allows more sunlight to be absorbed into the dark ocean, causing warming. Clouds reflect sunlight back to space but can also act like a greenhouse gas by absorbing heat leaving the earth’s surface; the net effect depends on how the cloud cover changes.

Human activities also have a large-scale impact on the earth’s land sur- face. Changes in land use due to urbanization and agricultural practices, although not global,are often most pronounced where people live,work, and grow food and are part of the human impact on climate. Land use changes affect,for example,how much of the sun’s energy is absorbed or reflected and how much precipitation evaporates back into the atmo- sphere.Large-scale deforestation and desertification in Amazonia and the Sahel,respectively,are two instances in which evidence suggests the likeli-42 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation hood of a human influence on regional climate (Andreae et al. 2004; Chagnon and Bras 2005).In general,city climates differ from those in sur- rounding rural green areas,causing an “urban heat island”due to greater heat retention ofurban surfaces,such as concrete and asphalt,as well as the waste generated from anthropogenic activities1 (Bornstein and Lin 2000; Changnon et al. 1981; Jones et al. 1990; Karl et al. 1988; Landsberg 1983; Peterson 2003). What Is a Climate Model and Why Is It Useful? Many of the scientific laws governing climate change and the processes involved can be quantified and linked by mathematical equations. Fig- ure 2-2 shows schematically the kinds of processes that can be included in climate models. Among them are many earth system components, such as atmospheric chemistry, ocean circulation, sea ice, land surface hydrology,biogeochemistry,2and atmospheric circulation.The physics of many,though not all,of the processes governing climate change are well understood and may be described by mathematical equations. Linking these equations creates mathematical models of climate that may be run on computers or supercomputers. Coupled climate models can include mathematical equations describing physical,chemical,and biogeochem- ical processes and are used because the climate system is composed of different interacting components. Coupled climate models are the preferred approach to climate modeling, but they cannot at present include all details ofthe climate system.One rea- son is that not all details of the climate system are understood,even though the major governing processes are known well enough to allow models to reproduce observed features, including trends, of global climate. Another reason is the prohibitive complexity and run-time requirements of models that might incorporate all known information about the climate system. Decisions on how to build any given climate model include trade-offs among the complexity of the model and the number of earth system components included,the model’s horizontal and spatial resolution,and the number of 1The global effects of these urban heat islands have been analyzed extensively and assessed to ensure that they do not bias measurements of global temperature. 2Biogeochemistry refers to the biological chemistry of the earth system, such as the uptake of atmospheric carbon by land and ocean vegetation.Understanding Climate Change 43 FIGURE 2-2 Components of the climate system and their interactions, including the human component. All these components must be modeled as a coupled system that includes the oceans, atmosphere, land, cryosphere, and biosphere. GCM = General Circulation Model.

Consequently, there is a hierarchy of models of varying complexity, often based on the degree to which approximations are required for each model or component processes omitted. Approximations in climate models represent aspects ofthe models that require parameter choices and “tuning.”As a simple example,imagine rep- resenting a single cumulus cloud in a global climate model.The cloud may encompass only a few hundred meters in vertical and horizontal space—a much finer resolution than can be run on today’s coupled atmosphere and ocean climate models.As a result,ifsuch clouds are to be incorporated into the climate model, some approximations must be made regarding the clouds’statistical properties within, say, an area 100 or 1,000 times larger than the cloud itself.This is referred to as model parameterization,and the process of selecting the most appropriate parameters to best simulate observed conditions is called model tuning. Similar methods are also required in today’s state-of-the-science weather forecasting models. An important difference between weather forecasting models and climate models is that the former are initialized with a specific set of observations representing today’s weather to predict the weather precisely xdays or hours into the future.By contrast,the initial conditions ofclimate models are much less important.Also,climate models are not intended to predict specific future weather events. Rather, they are used to simulate many years of“weather”into the future with the intent of understand- ing the change in the collection of weather events at some point in the future compared with some point in the past (often the climate of the past 30 years or so). Scientists are thus interested in properties of climate,such as average rainfall and temperature and the degree of fluc- tuation about that average.This comparison enables scientists to study the output of climate model simulations to understand the effect of various modifications of those aspects of the climate system that might cause the climate to change. A key challenge in climate modeling is to isolate and identify cause and effect.Doing so requires knowledge about the changes and variations in the external forcings controlling climate and a compre- hensive understanding ofclimate feedbacks (such as a change in the earth’s reflectivity because ofa change in the amount ofsea ice or clouds) and nat- ural climate variability.A related key challenge in climate modeling is the representation of sub-grid-scale processes, such as in some storms, and land-terrain effects.Understanding Climate Change 45 Model simulations of climate over specified periods can be verified and validated against the observational record. Likewise, model parame- terization schemes for particular processes of interest can be tested by comparison with observations and with higher-resolution, smaller-scale models. Models that describe climate variability and change well can be used as a tool to increase understanding of the climate system.Once eval- uated and validated, climate models can then be used for predictive purposes.Given specific forcing scenarios,the models can provide viable projections offuture climate.In fact,climate models have become the pri- mary means of projecting climate change, although ultimately, future projections are likely to be determined through a variety ofmeans,includ- ing the observed rate of global climate change. How Do We Know the Global Air Temperature Is Increasing? A comprehensive analysis of changes in temperatures near the earth’s sur- face and throughout much ofthe atmosphere is presented in the April 2006 CCSP Synthesis and Assessment Report 1.1 (Karl et al.2006).This report addresses the nagging issue of differences in the rate of warming between measurements derived near the surface (typically 2 m above the surface) and those taken from higher in the atmosphere (i.e.,the lower troposphere, or the atmosphere below roughly 12 km).The surface air temperatures are derived from several different analysis teams,using various combinations of ocean ships and buoys, land observations from weather reporting sta- tions,and satellite data.Atmospheric data sets have been derived by using satellites,weather balloons,and a combination of the two. Considering all the latest satellite, balloon, and surface records, the CCSP report concludes that there is no significant discrepancy between the rates of global temperature change over the past several decades at the surface compared with those higher in the atmosphere. The report does acknowledge, however, that there are still uncertainties in the tropics, related primarily to the data obtained from weather balloons.Many devel- oping countries are struggling to launch weather balloons routinely and process their measurements,and it is unclear whether scientists have been able to adjust adequately for known biases and errors in the data. Globally, data indicate that rates of temperature change have been similar throughout the atmosphere since 1979, when satellite data were first available,and that the rates ofchange have been slightly greater in the46 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation troposphere than on the earth’s surface since 1958 (when weather balloons first had adequate spatial coverage for global calculations).The global sur- face temperature time series shown in Figure 2-3 indicates warming on even longer time scales,with acceleration since 1976. Instrumental temperature measurements are not the only evidence for increasing global temperatures.The observed increased melting of glaciers can be used to estimate the rate of temperature increase since the late 19th century.Estimates ofnear-surface temperature based on glacial melting are very similar to estimates based on instrumental temperature data.A 15 to 20 percent reduction in Arctic sea ice since the 1970s,a 10 percent decrease in snow cover since the 1970s,and shortened periods of lake and river ice cover (about 2 weeks shorter since the 19th century) have been observed. Also, ocean heat content has significantly increased over the past several decades (IPCC 2007).

Since the 1980s, the scientific community has been actively working on detecting climate change and determining how much of the change is attributable to human activities.As described above,one set of tools often used for detection and attribution is mathematical computer models ofthe climate.Outstanding issues in modeling include specifying forcing mecha- nisms (e.g.,the causes ofclimate variability and change) within the climate system; addressing complex GHG feedback processes (e.g., methane and carbon) and properly dealing with indirect aerosol forcings and complex physical feedback processes (e.g.,energy and water sources); and improv- ing simulations of regional weather, especially extreme events. Today’s inadequate or incomplete measurements of the various forcing mecha- nisms,with the exception of well-mixed GHGs,add uncertainty when one is trying to simulate past and present climate. Confidence in predicting future climate depends on using climate models to attribute past and pres- ent climate changes to specific causes. Despite these issues, a substantial and growing body of evidence (IPCC 2007) shows that climate models are useful tools for understanding the factors leading to climate change. Recent CO emission trends are upward,with increases of0.5 to 1 per- 2 cent per year over the past few decades.Concentrations of both reflective and nonreflective aerosols are also estimated to be increasing.Net positive radiative forcings3 from GHGs dominate the net cooling forcings from aerosols,and the global temperature change over the past 25 to 30 years has exceeded the bounds of natural variability estimated from climate simula- tions with no human-caused changes. This has been the case since about 1980.As an example ofhow models are used to detect human influence on the climate system,Figure 2-4shows that,without including all the known forcing mechanisms (natural and human or anthropogenic), the models cannot replicate observed global temperature changes. Moreover, many aspects of the climate system other than global surface temperatures have been tested for human influences. 3Radiative forcing can be thought of as the change in heat flow [expressed in watts per square meter (W/m2)] at the tropopause due to an internal change or a change in the external forcing of the climate system, such as a change in the concentration of CO or the output of the sun. The 2 tropopause is the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere, represented by a rather abrupt change from decreasing to increasing temperature with height.48 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation FIGURE 2-4 Comparison of observed global change in surface temperature with simulations by climate models using natural and anthropogenic forcings. Decadal averages of observations are shown for 1906 to 2005 (black line) plotted against the center of the decade and relative to the corresponding average for 1901–1950. Solid shading shows the 5 to 95 percent range for 19 simulations from five climate models using only the natural forcings due to solar activity and volcanoes.

A proxy climate indicator is a local record that is interpreted, on the basis of physical and biophysical principles, to represent some combination of climate-related variations back in time. Climate-related data derived in this way are referred to as proxy data. Examples of proxies are tree ring records, characteristics of corals, and various data derived from ice cores.Understanding Climate Change 49 perature,in sea ice extent and other components of the cryosphere,and in ocean heat content; and new studies on extreme weather and climate events. Thus, there is high confidence that the observed warming, espe- cially during the period since the 1970s, is due mainly to human-caused increases in GHGs (Allen 2005;Gillett et al.2002;Hegerl et al.2001;IPCC 2007; Karl et al. 2006; Karoly and Wu 2005; Stone and Allen 2005; Stott et al.2001;Tett et al.2002;Zhang et al.2006;Zwiers and Zhang 2003).How climate warming will be manifested over the next 50 to 100 years and which factors will have the greatest potential impact on transportation are discussed in the following section. CLIMATE CHANGES RELEVANT TO U.S. TRANSPORTATION Climate variability and change impact transportation mainly through changes in weather extremes,such as very hot days,very cold days,or severe storms;changes in climate extremes,5such as increases in the probability of intense precipitation events and extended droughts;and sea level rise.The U.S. transportation system was built for the typical weather and climate experienced locally,including a reasonable range ofextremes,such as flood- ing events occurring as rarely as once in 100 years.Moderate changes in the mean climate have little impact on transportation infrastructure or opera- tions because the system is designed to accommodate changing weather conditions.However,changes in weather and climate extremes can have a considerable impact on transportation, especially if they push environ- mental conditions outside the range for which the system was designed. Weather and climate extremes of relevance to transportation have been changing over the past several decades and are projected to continue to change in the future,with both negative and positive effects on the trans- portation system. Table 2-1 lists the potential climate changes of greatest relevance for transportation, including the level of uncertainty associated with each. The following subsections address these changes in turn,largely summa- rizing the findings of a paper commissioned for this study (by Peterson 5The exact threshold for what is classified as an extreme varies from one analysis to another, but an extreme event would normally be as rare as, or rarer than, the top or bottom 10 percent of all occurrences (CCSP 2007). For the purposes of this report, all tornadoes and hurricanes are considered extreme.50 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation TABLE 2-1 Level of Uncertainty Associated with Potential Climate Changes of Greatest Relevance to Transportation Potential Climate Change of Relevance to U.S. Transportation Level of Uncertainty Temperature Increases in very hot days and heat waves Very likely Decreases in very cold days Virtually certain Increases in Arctic temperatures Virtually certain Later onset of seasonal freeze and earlier onset of seasonal thaw Virtually certain Sea level rise Virtually certain Precipitation Increases in intense precipitation events Very likely Increases in drought conditions for some regions Likely Changes in seasonal precipitation and flooding patterns Likely Storms Increases in hurricane intensity Likely Increased intensity of cold-season storms, with increases in Likely winds and in waves and storm surges Note: Italicized uncertainty designations are those identified by IPCC (2007).

Each subsection highlights past trends, future projections, and key uncertainties. (The reader is referred to the paper by Peterson et al. 2006 for more detail and additional figures to support the discussion.) Note that the discussion generally progresses from those climate changes about which there is most certainty to those about which there is less. Changes in Temperature An increase in air temperature allows more water vapor in the atmosphere, which defines the upper bounds of the amount of precipitation that can occur during short-term (e.g.,hourly to 1-day) extreme precipitation events. Surface moisture,ifavailable (as it always is over the oceans),effectively acts as the “air conditioner”ofthe surface,as heat used for evaporation moistens rather than warms the air.Therefore,another consequence of global heat- ing of the lower troposphere is accelerated land-surface drying and moreUnderstanding Climate Change 51 atmospheric water vapor (the dominant GHG).Human-induced warming has been linked to the water vapor increases in both surface observations (Willett et al.2007) and satellite observations over the oceans (Santer et al. 2007).Without an increase in precipitation,accelerated drying increases the incidence and severity of droughts (Dai et al. 2004), whereas additional atmospheric water vapor increases the risk of heavy precipitation events (Trenberth et al. 2003). Increases in global temperature also cause sea surface temperatures to rise, one of several important factors affecting hurricane intensity. Changes in Temperature Including Extremes U.S.temperatures have been rising over the past century,with more rapid increases since 1970 than earlier,as shown in Figure 2-5.It is unlikely that North American temperature changes since 1950 are due to natural cli- mate variability alone (Karoly et al. 2003). The warming has not been uniform across the continent. In general, the western portion of the FIGURE 2-5 Area-averaged mean temperature time series for the contiguous United States.

Alaska has warmed the most rapidly,with temperatures in some regions increasing by more than 0.6°C (1.1°F) per decade since 1970. These warming trends are projected to continue over the next cen- tury on the basis of reasonable scenarios for future GHG emissions. Figure 2-6 shows the temperatures projected for the eastern United States for three different scenarios, each scenario having been run by multiple models. Other areas of the United States show similar warm- ing trends [see Figure 6 in the commissioned paper by Peterson et al.2006 (Appendix C)]. It is interesting to note that for the next 30 years, the uncertainties are primarily model related and not due to different emis- sions scenarios. Even if atmospheric concentrations remained at current levels, the models would still project similar warming over the next couple of decades (IPCC 2007). FIGURE 2-6 Annual surface air temperature anomaly, from the 1990–1999 average, for the eastern United States and for three different emissions scenarios (SRES = Special Report on Emission Scenarios). (Source:Peterson et al. 2006, Figure 5.) Cº Cº YearUnderstanding Climate Change 53 Increases in Very Hot Days and Heat Waves The next century is likely to bring more very hot days and heat waves [see Figure 9 in the paper by Peterson et al.2006 (Appendix C)].The number of days with temperature above 32.2°C (90°F) and 37.7°C (100°F) has been increasing since 1970,but it is not quite as high today as during the early 1950s,when several areas,particularly the south-central United States, had severe droughts.By 2090–2099,it is expected that the average temper- ature on the hottest day of the year will be 2.5°C to 4.5°C (4.5°F to 8.1°F) warmer than the hottest day of the year in the 1990s.Not only will there be hotter and more very hot days, but it is likely that the continental United States will have significantly more heat waves with sustained high temperatures for 5 consecutive days or longer. There are several ways to conceptualize the change in very hot days. For example, the 20-year return value for the hottest day of the year in 2090–2099 can be compared with the same value for the 1990s. The 20-year return value is the temperature that is reached or exceeded on average once every 20 years over a long period oftime.Such temperatures are truly rare events because they are expected to be reached only three or four times during the course of a human lifetime.Over most of the con- tinental United States, the present-day 20-year return value temperatures would be reached or exceeded seven times or more in a 20-year interval by the end of the 21st century. Hence, the rare high-temperature event be- comes commonplace in this scenario. Figure 2-7 depicts another way of considering the change in very hot days expected in the next century,with Dallas, Texas, as an example. The figure shows the probability of having 1 to 20 days during the summer when the temperature exceeds 43.3°C (110°F).The probability increases substantially 25,50,and 90 years in the future. Similar plots are presented for Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Honolulu in the paper by Peterson et al.2006 (see Appendix C). Decreases in Very Cold Days The number of very cold days has been decreasing in the United States since about 1970 (see Figure 2-8).This trend is also expected to continue into the future across the continent.For example,in the Washington,D.C., area, there is currently a 75 percent chance that 3 days each winter will have maximum temperatures at or below freezing.By the end of the cen- tury,this probability is projected to drop to 20 percent.54 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 100 Current Year: 2007 + 25 Years: 2032 80 + 50 Years: 2057 + 90 Years: 2097 60 40 20 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Number of Days FIGURE 2-7 Current and future probability of having 1 to 20 days during the summer at or above 43.3(cid:2)C (110(cid:2)F) in Dallas, Texas. (Source:Peterson et al. 2006, Figure 10b.) ytilibaborP Later Onset ofSeasonal Freeze and Earlier Onset ofSeasonal Thaw It is not just extremes of temperature that can have an impact on trans- portation. In particular, the number of days from the last freeze in the spring to the first freeze in the fall is expected to increase.Figure 2-9shows a corresponding period—the length of time between the first day in the year that the maximum daily temperature reaches 21.1°C (70°F) and the last day of the year when this occurs. This interval has been increasing since 1970 and can be expected to increase further in the future. While there is considerable year-to-year variability in the number offreeze–thaw days (i.e., days when an observation station’s maximum temperature is above freezing and its minimum temperature below freezing),no distinct trend has been observed in this quantity. Changes in Sea Level Sea level is projected to rise over the next century,but there is significant uncertainty as to how much and how fast. The IPCC Third Assessment Report includes a range of estimates that sea levels will rise 0.1 to 0.9 m above 1990 levels by 2100 (IPCC 2001).To put this in context,the IPCCFIGURE 2-8 U.S. nationally averaged anomaly of the number of days at or below the coldest 10 percent of January maximum and minimum temperatures at each station (percentiles were calculated on a 1961–1990 base period).

Several analyses have identified a number of factors that as yet have uncertain likelihoods but could easily contribute to nonlinear and abrupt rises in sea level (IPCC 2007; Schoof 2007; Vaughan et al. 2007). Such extrapolations are tentative, however, because the extent to which the trends of the past decade are due to natural variability in the climate sys- tem is unknown. Global warming affects sea level through two mechanisms:thermal expansion of seawater and melting of ice present on land surfaces. Other factors also play a role in sea level, such as the amount of water held back by human-made land reservoirs,leading to sea level falls,but these factors are less important.There are still problems in reconciling the observed changes of the past century with the estimated contribu- tions from these different sources (Munk 2002).Most of the projected sea level rise is due to thermal expansion,but should the melting of the polar ice caps accelerate, sea level would rise much higher. The rapid melting of Greenland, which would have a very large impact, is possi- ble, but too little is known to assess its likelihood (IPCC 2007). Current model projections of sea level rise are based on the observed rate of melting during 1993–2003, but these rates could increase or decrease in the future. More important to transportation than the global change in sea level is the local apparent change in sea level (Burkett 2002; Titus 2002). Estimates of local apparent sea level rise take into account the vertical movement of land and coastal erosion.Coastal erosion,in turn,is driven by sea level rise.To estimate local sea level rise,land subsidence in the Gulf Coast and uplift along the New England coast are important factors (NRC 1987). Figure 2-10 illustrates that because of these factors, different regions can have quite different local sea level rise. Impacts ofSea Level Rise on Shoreline Location Predicting rates of shoreline retreat and land loss is critical to planning future coastal infrastructure. According to the Bruun rule, shorelinesUnderstanding Climate Change 57 Year FIGURE 2-10 Trends in sea level from global changes in seawater volume and local changes in land surface elevation for representative locations in the United States.

Thus, for a 0.5-m worldwide sea level rise, sandy shores could retreat 75 m.Although the Bruun rule is useful as a conceptual model,rigorous application ofcoastal geology and climatol- ogy models is necessary for risk analysis at specific locations. Exacerbation ofStorm Surge by Sea Level Rise Storm surge is the abnormal rise in sea level accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm,above the level of the normal or astronomic tide. Storm surge can be exacerbated by tidal piling,a phenomenon of abnor- mally high water levels from successive incoming tides that do not completely drain because of strong winds or waves persisting through successive tide cycles.Flooding due to coastal storms results from a com- bination of storm surge and intense precipitation.Storm surge is of great concern to port operations, mooring facilities, and moored vessels, as well as to coastal infrastructure that is vulnerable to flooding. Storm surge has been estimated or modeled by using the United States Army Corps of Engineers’ Waterways Experiment Station model; the National Weather Service’s Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hur- ricanes model; and more recently the Advanced Circulation Model (ADCIRC) (Westerink et al. 1994). These models use wind fields from past storms as input;these historical input data are updated infrequently. When updated, these models show wider areas of 100-year floodplains. For example,a recent analysis with the ADCIRC model using input data through the 2005 hurricane season showed greater storm surge and higher flooding. The magnitude of the 100-year storm surge flood (previously established using data for 1900–1956) would now recur at an interval of 75 years on the basis of data for 1900–2005 (Levinson 2006). Changes in Precipitation Changes in the Intensity ofHeavy and Extreme Precipitation Basic theory and climate model simulations as well as empirical evidence (see Figure 2-11) confirm that warmer climates,owing to increased water vapor,lead to more intense precipitation events even when total precipi- tation remains constant, with prospects for even stronger events when precipitation amounts increase. Figure 2-12 depicts the aggregate land-Understanding Climate Change 59 FIGURE 2-11 Diagram showing that warmer climates have a higher percentage of total rainfall coming from heavy and very heavy events.

This leads to more frequent events that are currently rare. For example, by the end of the 21st century, a conservative projection of climate change has the recurrence period (or average expected waiting time) for the current 1-in-20-year,heaviest daily precipitation event reduc- ing to every 6 to 8 years over much of North America (Kharin et al.2007; Wehner 2005). The practical implications of addressing these changes are seen in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) recent update of the Ohio River Basin’s 100-year daily precipitation return period. These data are used to help set engineering design standards related to excessive rainfall.Over the past several decades,increases in the amount of precipitation occurring during the heaviest daily precipitation events have been observed in many areas ofthe central and eastern United States (Groisman et al.2004;Groisman et al.2005;Karl and Knight 1998). In fact, over the 20th century, annual precipitation averaged across the United States increased by about 7 percent,but very intense precipitation events (above the 95th percentile) increased by nearly three times that rate (20 percent).The observed behavior supports one of the most con- fident projections that scientists can make about future precipitation. Considerable analysis has shown that because water vapor has increased in the atmosphere and will continue to do so with added anthropogenic GHG emissions,the intensity of precipitation will continue to increase in much of the United States (and elsewhere).In many regions of the world, increases in extreme precipitation are occurring even when total precipi- tation is relatively constant (Alpert et al. 2002; Groisman et al. 2003; Groisman et al.2005).In areas where overall precipitation increases,the increase in the intensity of very heavy precipitation events will be even greater. There are several different ways to think about how the increase in the intensity of heavy and extreme precipitation events might be manifested. One option is to consider changes in a 20-year return event. In the A1b emissions scenario,the present-day 20-year precipitation event would take place 2 to 4 times as frequently by the end ofthe 21st century [see Figure 27c and text in Peterson et al.2006 (Appendix C) for an explanation ofthe emis- sions scenarios].Another useful measure is the Simple Daily Intensity Index, which equals the total annual precipitation divided by the number ofdays with precipitation in that year.Figure 2-13a shows that this quantity has increased over the United States,indicating that on days that precipitation62 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 -0.2 -0.4 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Year SRES A2 SRES A1B 0.5 0.5 SRES B1 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0 0 2000 2020 2040 2060 2080 2100 Year FIGURE 2-13 (a) Upward trend in the Simple Daily Intensity Index (i.e., total precipitation per year divided by the number of days with precipitation) indicating that, on a U.S. area-averaged basis, when precipitation does occur, it tends to be heavier.

Median model projections for the future over the continental United States (Figure 2-13b) indicate that the Simple Daily Intensity Index is expected to continue to increase over the next century. Changes in the Severity and Frequency ofDrought Drought is a recurring feature of the climate system;major droughts have occurred in the past and are expected in the future.At any given time, at least part ofthe United States is in drought,with proportions ranging from 5 to 80 percent of the nation’s total land area. U.S. droughts show pro- nounced multiyear to multidecadal variability,but there is no convincing evidence for systematic long-term trends toward more or fewer events. Drought calculations have shown that over the United States,the increase in temperatures that may have led to increased evaporation has been com- pensated by a general increase in precipitation during the past few decades (Dai et al. 2004), with the result that there has been no general trend in drought intensity nationwide (Figure 2-14).Over the United States,climate model projections of precipitation change by the end of the 21st century show a tendency for increasing winter precipitation and decreasing sum- mer precipitation as global temperatures increase. Locations that do experience decreased precipitation in addition to the continuing increase in temperatures,such as the recently observed record-high January–June of 2006 (NOAA 2006), could have greater drought severity and frequency, especially during periods of dry weather due to increases in evaporation. Long-term warming trends have already led to changes in the timing of snowmelt and stream flows,especially in the West,resulting in earlier peak stream flows and diminished summertime flows. For the continental United States, the most extensive drought in the modern observational record occurred from 1933 to 1938. In July 1934, 80 percent ofthe United States was gripped by moderate or greater drought (see Figure 2-14), and 63 percent was experiencing severe to extreme drought.During 1953–1957,severe drought covered up to 50 percent ofthe country.Paleoclimatic data (e.g.,tree ring measurements) have been used to reconstruct drought patterns for the period prior to the modern instru- mental record (Cook et al.1999; Cook et al.2004).These reconstructions show that during most of the past two millennia,the climate of the west- ern United States has been more arid than at present.

(Source:NOAA, National Climatic Data Center.) River basin was exceeded in severity as recently as the 19th century.Within the past millennium,severe droughts in both the western United States and the Midwest have occurred that have lasted for multiple decades. One of the more robust findings of the IPCC (2007) relates to recent agreement among virtually all climate model simulations ofthe 21st cen- tury that a drying of the southwestern United States is evident. Seager et al. (2007) provide the details and indicate that this drying is attribut- able to both an increase in evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation. Droughts in this part ofthe country that occur naturally,such as those of the past two millennia, would be expected to be enhanced as a result of greenhouse forcing of the climate. Increased temperatures will lead to increased drying during periods of dry weather,leading to more intense droughts in much of the United States. For the southwestern United States,reduced precipitation will add to this effect.Understanding Climate Change 65 Changes in Storms Changes in Hurricane Intensity and Frequency Tropical storms,particularly hurricanes,are an important issue ofconcern for the United States.The record-breaking hurricane season of 2005,espe- cially the havoc created by Katrina,raised public awareness of the dangers ofhurricanes to new heights.Hurricanes respond to a number ofenviron- mental factors,including ocean temperatures,atmospheric stability,wind changes,El Niño,and others.One important question is whether hurricane activity has changed over the past 100 years.Since 1995,Atlantic hurricane activity has increased substantially, with more and more intense hurri- canes,compared with the previous two decades,and this increased level of activity is also reflected in those hurricanes striking the United States (see Figure 2-15). Earlier periods, however, such as 1945–1970, were nearly as active. FIGURE 2-15 Number of hurricanes striking the United States, 1901–2005, summed by 5-year periods (e.g., 1901–1905, 1906–1910). The black bars represent the number of major hurricanes (Category 3–5) and the gray bars the number of weaker Category 1 and 2 hurricanes per 5-year period (pentad). (Source:NOAA, National Climatic Data Center.) senacirruH gnillafdnaL fo rebmuN Pentad66 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation An important consideration with regard to hurricane intensity is the trend toward warmer sea surface temperatures,particularly in the tropical Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico,indicating that climate change may play some role in increased hurricane intensity (Emanuel 2005;Webster et al. 2005). Another factor is a slow cycle of natural fluctuations in atmo- spheric conditions and ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic,referred to as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which is currently in a warm ocean temperature phase. What does the future hold for hurricane activity? In the near term,it is expected that favorable conditions for Atlantic hurricanes will persist for the next decade or so on the basis of previously active periods. For the longer term, climate models project an increase in the intensity of strong hurricanes in the 21st century (Bengtsson et al.2007;McDonald et al.2005; Oouchi et al.2006;Sugi et al.2002).Specifically,this translates to increases in wind speed and about a half-category increase in intensity on the com- monly used Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Intensity Scale as tropical sea surface temperatures increase by nearly 2°C. Given these conditions (stronger hurricanes and warmer tropical sea surface temperatures), climate mod- els also predict an increase in storm rainfall rates of about 20 percent (T.R. Knutson, personal communication, 2006). No robust projections concerning the annual global number of tropical storms have yet emerged from modeling studies,but more detailed analyses focused on the Atlantic Ocean suggest no significant increases in the annual number of Atlantic tropical storms (CCSP 2007).Many relevant factors,such as future changes in wind field patterns,remain very difficult to predict. Extratropical Storms The IPCC AR4 models projected a reduction in the total number of mid- latitude cyclones and an increase in the number of intense storms.This is a robust result, yielded by essentially all the models (Lambert and Fyfe 2006).Associated with these changes is an increase in ocean wave height in the northeastern Atlantic and the northern Pacific (Wang et al.2004). Analysis of the conditions that cause thunderstorm systems in the United States to produce hail results in a time series fairly similar to the U.S.tem- perature time series shown in Figure 2-5, decreasing from 1950 to the 1970s and then increasing (Brooks and Dotzek 2008). Projecting these conditions into the future is difficult because contemporary climate mod- els lack sufficient resolution to simulate these storms directly.Understanding Climate Change 67 Visibility Some ofthe climate changes discussed earlier in this chapter may have sec- ondary effects.Visibility is one such effect.For example,if the number of intense extratropical storms increases,they may be accompanied by more time with low visibility during heavy snowfall events (Rasmussen et al. 1999).Projections of drying in the interior of continents would imply the possibility of increases in blowing dust. The risk of forest wildfires in the American West is strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring melt (Westerling et al.2006) as well as possible biomass increases from increased precipitation (e.g.,Bachelet et al. 2001;Lenihan et al.2003).These are exactly the conditions being projected by models for the future.Therefore,wildfire-induced decreases in visibility are likely to become more frequent.It is uncertain from a theoretical stand- point how the occurrence of fog might change in a warming climate. Therefore,while the number oflow-visibility events associated with intense storms and fires might be projected to increase,it is uncertain whether the total number of occurrences of low visibility would increase, decrease, or remain the same in the projected climate of the future. Transportation is significantly affected when visibility drops to less than about 400 m (0.25 mi).Times with such low visibility are associated primarily with fog, heavy precipitation, blowing sand or snow, or smoke from wildfires. Observations of past trends in visibility and models of changes projected for the future are not currently available.While visibil- ity is observed at airports throughout the United States, changes in observing practices over the past decades make it inappropriate to exam- ine long-term changes in low visibility without a major effort to assess the data’s homogeneity. Climate Considerations Related to Alaska The Alaskan Arctic and sub-Arctic are recognized as the area of the world where changes to the climate are likely to be among the greatest,leading to significant impacts.In addition,the area has always experienced great natu- ral climatic variability.Because the climate changes in Alaska are so distinct from those in the rest of the United States, this section is devoted to an examination of these expected changes as they relate to transportation. Climate variables ofparticular relevance to the transportation sector in Alaska include (a) the extent of sea ice, snow cover, and permafrost, all68 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation directly driven by temperature change and to some extent by atmospheric and oceanic circulation;(b) storminess as related to wave height and storm surges;(c) precipitation and related snow and ice cover;and (d) sea level as related to land ice,ocean temperature,and movement of the land relative to the ocean due to geologic features and glacial rebound of the land as land ice melts. Generally, the extent of sea ice is important because the ice dampens the energy of ocean waves. Wave energy is dependent on the distance traveled by the wind over open water. Less extensive sea ice exposes the coastline to more frequent and potentially higher ocean waves and swells. Temperature drives the extent of sea ice, but changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation also play an important role in multiyear variations in the extent and location of sea ice.Changes in the type,amount,and intensity of precipitation,as well as the extent of snow and ice cover,can also con- tribute to coastal erosion from stream flow and overland runoff to the sea. Loss of permafrost along coasts can lead to subsidence of the land,which occurs when ice beneath the sea and along the shoreline melts.Alaska has considerable permafrost along its northern and western coasts.The height ofthe sea relative to the land is the ultimate long-term driver ofcoastal ero- sion,but Alaskan sea level rise is complicated by both climatic factors and geologic forces, affecting local and regional changes in the height of the land relative to the ocean. Atmospheric Temperature Temperatures in Alaska have increased. Observational data indicate that Alaskan spring and summer surface temperatures have increased by about 2°C to 3°C (about 4°F to 5°F) in the past few decades.However,there are no discernible trends in temperature during autumn,and changes in win- ter temperature are more complex. There were two 5-year periods in the first half of the 20th century when temperatures were nearly as warm as today,but record-breaking high temperatures have become more common during recent decades. Most climate model projections for temperature change during the 21st century suggest that Alaska, and the Arctic as a whole, will warm at least twice as much as the rest of the world.The warming is expected to be greatest during the cold halfofthe year.The observed lack ofwarming dur- ing the autumn and the relatively large increases during other times of the year are not entirely consistent with model projections;they do not depict this asymmetry.Understanding Climate Change 69 As temperatures increase and sea ice continues to melt,a natural cli- mate feedback occurs as a result ofless reflection ofsunlight by the ocean formerly covered by sea ice.This feedback can lead to accelerated warm- ing and additional sea ice melting.At present,the rate ofloss ofNorthern Hemisphere sea ice is exceeding climate model projections, and at the present rate of loss, summer sea ice will be absent before the middle of this century.Climate models do project an acceleration of sea ice retreat over the 21st century,with periods of extensive melting lasting progres- sively further into spring and fall.All climate models project this trend to continue regardless of the emission scenario used and the sensitivity of the model. Large portions of Northern Hemisphere sea ice form during the cold seasons and melt during the warm seasons. Considerable sea ice persists through the melt season, but because of ocean circulation and the resultant ice movement, multiyear sea ice makes up only a fraction of the total ice extent. Records indicate that the formation of new sea ice each year cannot keep pace with the rate of melting, which is con- sistent with observed surface warming. Northern Hemisphere sea ice has been decreasing steadily since the 1950s, measured largely through continuous coverage provided by NOAA polar orbiting satellites begin- ning in the 1970s.Prior to that time,assessment ofthe extent ofNorthern Hemisphere sea ice during the first half of the 20th century was limited to reports from land stations and ocean surface observations.Scientists have less confidence in the data for the first part of the century, but independent anecdotal evidence,such as interviews with native peoples of Alaska, also suggests substantially greater extent of sea ice earlier in the century. It is important to understand trends in the extent of coastal sea ice because it is an important determinant ofwave energy affecting coastlines. As the storms that create wave energy also exhibit strong seasonal varia- tion,it is important to know how sea ice is changing by season.Since the 1950s,the extent of sea ice during winter and autumn has decreased from 15 million square kilometers (km2) to 14 million km2and from 12 million km2to 11 million km2,respectively.Since the 1950s,decreases in spring and summer have been substantially greater,down from an average of 15 mil- lion km2to 12 million km2and 11 million km2to 8 million km2,respectively. This is equivalent to more than 10 percent ofthe North American land mass and is an area larger than the state ofAlaska.70 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Extratropical Storms The climatology of Pacific Ocean storms favors the development of the strongest storms (extratropical cyclones) from autumn to spring.Although there are remaining uncertainties about the quality of the data,analyses of Pacific Ocean extratropical cyclones over the past 50 years indicate little change in the total number but a significant increase in the number of intense storms (those with low central pressure and resultant high winds and waves).The increase in extratropical storms is punctuated by consid- erable year-to-year variability. Both observational evidence and modeling projections support the notion that as the world warms, the intensity of cyclones in the northern Pacific (and the northern Atlantic) will increase (e.g.,Lambert and Fyfe 2006;Wang et al.2006). Even without an increase in storm intensity,the greater expanse ofopen water due to less extensive sea ice means that ocean waves, with resultant coastal erosion,can occur more frequently and with greater impact. Precipitation and Extent ofSnow Cover One ofthe most difficult quantities to measure across the state ofAlaska is precipitation. This is the case because of the variable nature of precipita- tion in general,the relatively low number of observing stations across the state,and the difficulty of providing high-quality data in the harsh Arctic environment. The large uncertainty in estimated precipitation trends is also due to the difficulty of measuring wind-blown solid precipitation. On the basis of existing records,however,there is evidence to indicate that during the past 40 years,as temperatures have warmed,more pre- cipitation has been falling in liquid form (rain) as opposed to solid form (snow, ice). The quantity of precipitation also increased during the 20th century,with much of that increase occurring during the recent period of warming over the past 40 years.The increase is estimated to be between 10 and 20 percent,with most of it occurring during the summer and winter rather than during the transition seasons. Because of greater overall precipitation in the summer,the percent increase in summer equates to a greater quantity of precipitation compared with winter. Analyses ofchanges in intense precipitation events have been conducted for areas south of 62°N latitude. They show that the frequency of intense precipitation events has increased substantially (30 to 40 percent) during the past several decades.Thus,a disproportionate amount of the precipita- tion increase is attributable to the most intense precipitation events.Understanding Climate Change 71 Climate models project that precipitation will increase by a greater proportion in the high latitudes compared with the rest ofthe world.This result is consistent from model to model,as is the fact that this increase is expected to be disproportionately larger in the more intense precipitation events.Both of these phenomena can lead to increased erosion. NOAA’s polar-orbiting environmental satellite data and surface-based observations have also revealed major changes in the extent ofsnow cover. The extent of North American snow cover has decreased by about 1 mil- lion km2, and this trend is expected to continue or accelerate. Surface observers also report a 1- to 2-week reduction in the number of days with snow on the ground across the state.In addition,in the Arctic,the lake and river ice season is now estimated to be 12 days shorter than in the 19th century. The increase in total and liquid precipitation, especially when falling on less extensive snow cover,can affect soil erosion.However,the complex effects of changes in precipitation type and intensity, earlier breakup of winter ice,and less extensive snow cover have not been well evaluated with respect to potential impacts on coastal erosion and flooding.It will be nec- essary to know which factor dominates in order to understand whether coastal erosion and flooding will be enhanced or ameliorated as a result of changes in the extent of precipitation and snow cover. Permafrost Thawing ofthe permafrost,especially along the northern coasts,is expected to continue. Long-term measurements of temperatures within the per- mafrost are rare, but it is clear that as air and ocean temperatures have warmed, permafrost has been melting. As permafrost melts along the coastlines,the effect on coastal erosion can be compounded by the retreat of sea ice. The thaw causes the land to subside along the shore, expos- ing more land to the action of the waves.The thaw also causes slumping and landslides in the interior, undermining structures built on or near permafrost. Sea Level A general increase in sea level would expose more land to coastal erosion through wave energy and storm surges. However, it is important to rec- ognize that there are many local and regional variations in sea level rise, and Alaska is no exception in this regard.Complications arise because of72 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation geologic forces; the rebound of the land as glaciers melt; and in some areas,local engineering projects.For certain areas in Alaska (e.g.,parts of southeast Alaska),sea level is actually falling as a result ofnatural geologic and glacial rebound effects, but this is generally not the case in much of the state. It is clear, however, that changes in Alaskan climate are among the greatest in the world. They have likely played an important role in determining the extent ofcoastal erosion and flooding in the state and are likely to continue to do so in the future.Accelerated coastal erosion and flooding linked to sea level rise in Alaska cannot be ruled out. FINDINGS The state of the science continues to indicate that modern climate change is affected by human influences, primarily human-induced changes in atmospheric composition that are warming the climate. These changes result mainly from emissions of GHGs associated with energy use,but on local and regional scales, urbanization and land use changes are also important contributors to climate change.Once in the atmosphere,GHG concentrations have a long residence time—on the order of a century. Thus,they would continue to affect climate conditions even ifGHG emis- sions were eliminated today,and they demand a response. Substantial progress has been made in monitoring and understanding the causes of climate change, but scientific, technical, and institutional challenges to improving projections of future climate change remain. For example,considerable uncertainty persists about the rates of climate change that can be expected during the 21st century.Nevertheless,it is clear that climate change will be increasingly manifested in important and tan- gible ways,such as changes in extremes of temperature and precipitation, decreases in seasonal and perennial snow and ice extent,and rising sea lev- els. In addition, climate models project an increase in the intensity of strong hurricanes, with an increase in related storm rainfall rates, in the 21st century.Thus,as human-induced climate changes are superimposed on the natural variability of the climate,the future will include new classes of weather and climate extremes not experienced in modern times. Climate changes will affect transportation largely through these extremes.The U.S.transportation system was built for the typical weather and climate experienced locally,including a reasonable range of extremes. If projected climate changes push environmental conditions outside the range for which the system was designed—and the scientific evidence sug-Understanding Climate Change 73 gests that this will be the case—the impacts will be significant. They will vary by mode of transportation and region of the country,and some will be positive;in general,however,the impacts will be widespread and costly in both human and economic terms and require significant changes in the planning,design,construction,operation,and maintenance oftransporta- tion systems. In the next chapter, the likely impacts of projected climate changes on transportation are examined in detail.

Journal ofClimate,Vol.16,pp.793–797.3 Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation T his chapter explores what is known about the potential impacts of climate change on transportation.First,the vulnerability ofthe trans- portation system to climate change is considered,recognizing,however,that not all changes will have negative impacts. Then, the potential impacts of the major climate change factors of relevance for U.S.transportation iden- tified in the previous chapter are described for each transportation mode. Next, the few studies that have actually assessed the impacts of climate change on transportation in a particular region or metropolitan area are reviewed;these studies provide a good illustration ofregional differences in both expected climate changes and impacts.The chapter ends with the com- mittee’s findings on the impacts of climate change on transportation. VULNERABILITY OF THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM TO CLIMATE CHANGE No comprehensive inventory exists of U.S. transportation infrastructure vulnerable to climate change impacts,the potential extent ofthat exposure, or the potential damage costs.Nevertheless,some salient data can be pieced together from various sources.For example,53 percent ofthe U.S.popula- tion lives in counties with coastal areas,although such areas make up only 17 percent of the nation’s contiguous land area (Crossett et al. 2004; U.S. Census Bureau 2005,28).1 Population density in coastal counties (exclud- 1Coastal areas are defined by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as counties and equivalent areas with at least 15 percent of their land area either in a coastal watershed or in a coastal area between watersheds. 7980 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation ing Alaska) is significantly higher than the national average—300 versus 98 persons per square mile—reflecting the limited land area involved (Crossett et al. 2004). This population swells in the summer months, as beaches are the top tourist destination (Douglass et al.2005).Coastal areas are projected to experience continued development pressures as both retirement magnets and tourist destinations. For example, many of the most populous coastal counties located in California, south Florida, and Texas (Harris County),which already experience the effects of hurricanes and other tropical storms, are expected to grow rapidly in the coming decades (Crossett et al.2004).This growth will generate demand for more transportation infrastructure and increase the difficulty of evacuation in an emergency. Sea level rise, which climate scientists now believe to be virtually cer- tain,in combination with expected population growth,will aggravate the situation, making housing and infrastructure in low-lying coastal areas even more vulnerable to extensive flooding and higher storm surges. An estimated 60,000 miles of coastal highways is already exposed to periodic coastal storm flooding and wave action (Douglass et al.2005).2Those high- ways that currently serve as evacuation routes during hurricanes and other coastal storms could be compromised in the future.Although coastal high- way mileage is a small fraction ofthe nearly 4 million miles ofpublic roads in the United States,the vulnerability of these highways is concentrated in a few states,and some ofthese routes also serve as barriers to sea intrusion and as evacuation routes (Titus 2002). Coastal areas are also major centers of economic activity. Six of the nation’s top 10 U.S.freight gateways (by value of shipments) (BTS 2007) will be at risk from sea level rise (see Table 3-1). Seven of the 10 largest ports (by tons of traffic) (BTS 2007, 30) are located in the Gulf Coast, whose vulnerability was amply demonstrated during the 2005 tropical storm season.3 The Gulf Coast is also home to the U.S.oil and gas indus- tries,providing nearly 30 percent ofthe nation’s crude oil production and 2These estimates were made by using geographic information systems to measure the length of roads in coastal counties, superimposing data from the Flood Insurance Rate Maps of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to indicate those roads along the coast or tidal rivers likely to be inundated by storm surge in a 100-year storm, and finally adjusting the estimate to eliminate flooding from rainfall runoff. 3The Port of South Louisiana is the nation’s largest port by tonnage and the largest agricultural export facility in the United States (Mineta 2005). Fortunately, it suffered only minor structural damage from Hurricane Katrina.Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 81 TABLE 3-1 Top 10 U.S. Foreign Trade Freight Gateways by Value of Shipments, 2005 Shipment Value Rank Port Mode ($ billions) 1 John F.

Several thousand off-shore drilling platforms,dozens of refineries,and thousands of miles of pipelines are vulnerable to disruption and dam- age from storm surge and high winds of tropical storms,as was recently demonstrated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.Those hurricanes halted all oil and gas production from the Gulf, disrupted nearly 20 percent of the nation’s refinery capacity, and closed oil and gas pipelines (CBO 2006).4 Climate scientists believe that global warming is likely to increase the inten- sity of strong hurricanes making landfall,increasing the risk of damage to or lengthening the disruption in the operation of these vital facilities. Inland areas are also likely to experience the effects of climate change. Increased intense precipitation predicted by climate scientists for the con- tinental United States could increase the severity ofsuch events as the great flood of 1993.That event caused catastrophic flooding along 500 miles of the Mississippi and Missouri River system, paralyzing surface transporta- tion systems, including rail, truck, and marine traffic. Major east–west traffic was halted for roughly 6 weeks in an area stretching from St.Louis 4By the end of 2005—4 months after Hurricane Katrina and a little more than 3 months after Hurricane Rita—roughly one-quarter of crude oil production and one-fifth of natural gas production from the Gulf remained shut down (CBO 2006). Two percent of the nation’s refinery capacity still was not operating.82 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation west to Kansas City and north to Chicago,affecting one-quarter of all U.S. freight that either originated or terminated in the flood-affected region (Changnon 1996).Drier conditions are likely to prevail in the summer in midcontinental regions, such as the Saint Lawrence Seaway.Weather and vessel incidents cause most of the lock downtime on the seaway, but in 2000 and 2001,water levels were at their lowest point in 35 years,reducing vessel carrying capacity to about 90 percent of normal (BTS 2005,140).If low water levels become more common because ofdryer conditions due to climate change, freight movements in the region could be seriously impaired,and extensive dredging could be required to keep shipping chan- nels open (Great Lakes Regional Assessment Team 2000; Quinn 2002).A longer shipping season afforded by a warmer climate,however,could off- set some of the resulting adverse economic effects. The vulnerability of transportation infrastructure to climate change is in part a function ofits robustness and degree ofprotection from exposure to climate change effects (as is the case,for example,with seawalls and lev- ees).It also depends on the amount of redundancy in the system.Box 3-1 illustrates how system redundancies proved critical to the rapid restora- tion of partial rail service during both Hurricane Katrina and the 1993 Mississippi River flood.5 Yet the predominant trend has been for the rail- roads (as well as other owners of infrastructure) to shed uneconomical unused capacity by consolidating operations and abandoning underused lines. Likewise, major businesses, both manufacturing and retail, have reduced operating costs through just-in-time delivery strategies, but with the effect of increasing their vulnerability to disruptions or failures of the transportation system from either natural or human causes. The network character of the transportation system can help mitigate the negative economic consequences ofa shock to the system,particularly in the longer term, as shipments can be shifted to alternative modes or other regions can pick up the interrupted service.To illustrate,the Port of Gulfport, Mississippi, which was competing with New Orleans to be the second-largest container port in the Gulf,was 95 percent destroyed by the 30-foot storm surge from Hurricane Katrina (Plume 2005).Subsequently, much ofthe traffic shifted to other ports while Gulfport undertook major reconstruction of its facilities. On the other hand, the network character 5See also the discussion later in this chapter of the results of a case study of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita commissioned for this study.Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 83 BOX 3-1 Examples of the Role of System Redundancies in the Restoration of Critical Infrastructure Following Natural Disasters Hurricane Katrina significantly damaged rail transport in the Gulf Coast region, particularly east–west traffic through the New Orleans interchange rail gateway—one of only four major rail crossings of the Mississippi River. CSX was the rail carrier most affected, sustaining significant damage to two-thirds of its track mileage between Mobile and New Orleans and to five railroad bridges between Biloxi and New Orleans (M. Hinsdale, presenta- tion to the committee, Jan. 5, 2006). Estimated reconstruction costs were approximately $300 million, or about one-quarter of CSX’s annual operat- ing revenues available for capital investment. Nevertheless, CSX coped with the situation by using “borrowed” track of other, less hard-hit railroads in the region and by rerouting freight as far north as the St. Louis Mississippi River crossing. CSX has committed to rebuilding its coastal track in the short term but is evaluating less vulnerable alternative routes using exist- ing rail corridors or constructing farther inland. At the time, the flood of 1993 was hailed as the worst natural disaster ever experienced by the U.S. railroad industry. Total physical damages amounted to more than $282 million in 2005 dollars—23 percent of which included costs to operate detoured trains (Changnon 2006). In addi- tion, because of the delays, the railroads lost revenues of $198 million. Nevertheless, nearly 3,000 long-distance trains were rerouted onto other railroad lines and some little-used lines bordering on abandonment. System redundancies and operating arrangements with other carriers enabled the affected railroads to continue operating—more slowly and at increased cost— but operating nonetheless. of the transportation system can work to magnify the effects of a shock to the system,particularly when critical links are damaged or destroyed.This situation was well illustrated during Hurricane Katrina with the loss of critical highway and rail bridges. POTENTIAL IMPACTS BY TRANSPORTATION MODE The impacts ofclimate change on transportation infrastructure will differ depending on the particular mode of transportation,its geographic loca-84 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation tion, and its condition. This section is focused on those climate changes and weather parameters identified in the previous chapter (see Table 2-1) that climate scientists agree are most likely to occur over the course ofthis century and are of greatest relevance to transportation.Potential impacts on all modes of transport—land, marine, and aviation—are considered. However, the discussion is intended to be illustrative rather than com- prehensive in coverage, highlighting major impacts, similarities and differences among modes,and implications for adaptation strategies. Annex 3-1 gives the relevant climate and weather parameters along with potential impacts by transportation mode. In preparing this table, the committee drew on past efforts to identify transportation-sensitive weather conditions, as well as the collective expertise of the committee members.Some notable past reports include the Weather Information for Surface Transportation National Needs Assessment Report (OFCM 2002), the Metropolitan East Coast Assessment (Gornitz and Couch 2000; see detail in the next section), the U.S. Department of Transportation Workshop on Transportation and Climate Change (USDOT 2002),and an article by Black (1990). In addition, the discussion in this section draws heavily on a paper commissioned for this study (Peterson et al. 2006; see Appendix C) that provides a more detailed discussion of the potential impacts of climate change on transportation on the basis of recent global climate simulations. The primary focus here is on the direct impacts of potential climate changes on transportation infrastructure. Nevertheless, many of these effects will be influenced by the environment in which the infrastructure is located.For example,increased precipitation levels in some regions will affect moisture levels in the soil and hydrostatic buildup behind retaining walls and abutments and the stability of pavement subgrades. Runoff from increased precipitation levels will also affect stream flow and sedi- ment delivery in some locations,with potentially adverse effects on bridge foundations.Permafrost decline will affect Arctic land forms and hydrol- ogy,with potentially adverse effects on the stability of road- and rail beds. And sea level rise will affect coastal land forms, exposing many coastal areas to storm surge as barrier islands and other natural barriers dis- appear. Such changes are noted here, but their variability from region to region prohibits further elaboration. There are also likely to be many indirect effects of potential climate changes on transportation. For example, possible climate-caused shifts inImpacts of Climate Change on Transportation 85 demographics or in the distribution ofagricultural production,forests,and fisheries would have implications for road usage and other transport pat- terns between emerging economic centers and urban areas.Transportation patterns could also shift as the tourism industry responds to changes in eco- logically or recreationally interesting destinations.Similarly,climate changes elsewhere in the world that shift markets or demographics could affect the U.S.transportation system. Other indirect effects may be manifested at the interface between mit- igation and adaptation.Likely U.S.regulation of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency will affect transportation activities,potentially shifting travel to more energy-efficient modes (see Appendix B). Furthermore, climate changes may present additional challenges to meeting air and water quality standards. For example, warmer summertime temperatures will exacerbate air pollution,partic- ularly ground-level ozone, likely requiring further action to mitigate transportation-related emissions of pollutants. Similarly, changes in runoff resulting from modified precipitation regimes could affect water quality,with implications for roadway treatments. Impacts of Warming Temperatures and Temperature Extremes Land Transportation Modes Land transportation modes comprise highways (including bridges and tunnels); rail (including private rail lines and public transportation); the vehicles that use these facilities—passenger cars,trucks,buses,rail and rail transit cars—and pipelines (recognizing that the latter are buried under- ground in many areas). Projected warming temperatures and more heat extremes will affect all of these modes (see Annex 3-1).The effects of temperature warming are already being experienced in Alaska in the form of continued retreat of permafrost regions (see the discussion of Alaska below),creating land subsidence issues for some sections of the road and rail systems and for some of the elevated supports for aboveground sections of the Trans- Alaska pipeline. Warming winter temperatures have also shortened the season for ice roads that provide vital access to communities and indus- trial activities in remote areas. Alaska’s situation is quite different from that of many of the lower 48 states, however, where warming temperatures should have less dra-86 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation matic, and in some cases beneficial, effects. In many northern states, for example, warming winter temperatures will bring about reductions in snow and ice removal costs, lessen adverse environmental impacts from the use of salt and chemicals on roads and bridges, extend the construc- tion season,and improve the mobility and safety of passenger and freight travel through reduced winter hazards.Expected increases in temperature extremes,however,will have less positive impacts.More freeze–thaw con- ditions may occur,creating frost heaves and potholes on road and bridge surfaces and resulting in load restrictions on certain roads to minimize the damage.With the expected earlier onset of seasonal warming,the period of springtime load restrictions may be reduced in some areas but is likely to expand in others with shorter winters but longer thaw seasons. Periods ofexcessive summer heat are likely to increase wildfires,threat- ening communities and infrastructure directly and bringing about road and rail closures in affected areas. Longer periods of extreme heat may compromise pavement integrity (e.g.,softening asphalt and increasing rut- ting from traffic); cause deformation of rail lines and derailments or,at a minimum, speed restrictions (Rossetti 2002);6 and cause thermal expan- sion of bridge joints, adversely affecting bridge operation and increasing maintenance costs.Pipelines in the lower 48 states are not likely to experi- ence adverse effects from heat extremes. Marine Transportation Marine transportation infrastructure includes ports and harbors and supporting intermodal terminals and the ships and barges that use these facilities. Expected climate change impacts differ for coastal and inland waterways. Warming winter temperatures,particularly in northern coastal areas, could be a boon for marine transportation. Fewer days below freezing would reduce problems with ice accumulation on vessels,decks,riggings, and docks; the occurrence of dangerous ice fog; and the likelihood of ice jams in ports.The striking thinning (Rothrock and Zhang 2005) and over- all downward trend in the extent (Stroeve et al.2005) of Arctic sea ice are regarded as a major opportunity for shippers (Annex 3-1). In the short 6Proper installation of continuous welded rail usually prevents kinks from occurring, but not always (Changnon 2006).Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 87 term,continued reduction in Arctic sea ice should result in more ice-free ports, improved access to both ports and natural resources in remote areas,and longer shipping seasons.In the longer term,shippers are look- ing forward to new Arctic shipping routes that could provide significant cost savings in shipping times and distances (see the discussion of Alaska below).For the next several decades,however,warming temperatures and melting sea ice are likely to result in increased variability in year-to-year shipping conditions and higher costs due to requirements for stronger ships and support systems (e.g., ice-capable ship designs, icebreaker escorts, search and rescue support) (ACIA 2004). In addition, improved access to remote areas may increase the risk ofenvironmental degradation to fragile ecosystems. Warming temperatures are also likely to provide longer shipping sea- sons for the St.Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes (Annex 3-1).Because of the complex interaction among warmer temperatures,reduced lake ice, and increased evaporation, however, all nine climate model simulations suggest lower lake levels as the climate warms (Great Lakes Regional Assessment Team 2000).7 With lower lake levels, ships will be unable to carry as much cargo,and hence shipping costs will increase,although some of the adverse economic impacts could be offset by a longer shipping sea- son.8 A recent study of the economic impact of climate change on Canadian commercial navigation on the Great Lakes, for example, found that predicted lowering of Great Lakes water levels would result in an esti- mated increase in shipping costs for Canadian commercial navigation of between 13 and 29 percent by 2050, all else remaining equal (Millard 2005).9 Lower water levels could also create periodic problems for river traffic,reminiscent of the stranded barges on the Mississippi River during the drought of 1988 (du Vair et al.2002).In the longer run,of course,less 7See in particular Chapter 4 on climate change and shipping/boating. 8According to the Lake Carriers’ Association, a 1,000-foot-long vessel typically used for intralake transport loses 270 tons of capacity for each inch of draft loss. (Draft is the distance between the water line and the bottom of the vessel.) Oceangoing vessels, sized for passage through the St. Lawrence Seaway, are approximately 740 feet long and lose 100 tons of capacity for each inch of draft lost (Great Lakes Regional Assessment Team 2000). 9Impacts were estimated on the basis of three climate scenarios: one that assumes a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of CO by midcentury and two that assume a more gradual increase 2 in greenhouse gases and include the cooling effects of sulfate aerosols. The study found that economic impacts varied widely by commodity and route.88 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation efficient waterborne commodity movement would likely result in shifts to other transportation modes, such as truck and rail. Increased dredging could offset some of the impacts of climate change,but at a high cost and with potentially negative environmental consequences. Air Transportation Air transportation comprises airports and ground facilities,as well as the airplanes that carry both passengers and freight and the air traffic control system. Warming temperatures and possible increases in temperature extremes will affect airport ground facilities—runways in particular—in much the same way that they will affect roads.In Alaska,where use of air transport is atypically high relative to land transportation modes and many airstrips are built on permafrost,continued retreat and thawing of permafrost could undermine runway foundations, necessitating major repairs or even relocation of some landing strips (Annex 3-1;U.S.Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003).In contrast,airports in many of the lower 48 northern states are likely to benefit from reduc- tions in the cost of snow and ice removal and in the environmental impacts of salt and chemical use. Airlines could benefit as well from reduced need for deicing ofairplanes.The amount ofany reduction,how- ever,will depend on the balance between expected warming and increased precipitation. More heat extremes,however,are likely to be problematic.They could cause heat buckling of runways. Extreme heat can also affect aircraft lift; hotter air is less dense,reducing mass flowing over the wing to create lift. The problem is exacerbated at high-altitude airports. If runways are not sufficiently long for large aircraft to build up enough speed to generate lift, aircraft weight must be reduced or some flights canceled altogether.Thus, increases in extreme heat are likely to result in payload restrictions,flight cancellations, and service disruptions at affected airports, and could require some airports to extend runway lengths,if feasible.An analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the Denver and Phoenix airports estimated summer cargo loss (June through August) for a single Boeing 747 of about 17 and 9 percent, respectively, by 2030 because ofthe effects ofincreased temperature and water vapor (T.R.Karl and D.M. Anderson, Emerging Issues in Abrupt Climate Change, brief- ing,March 12,2007).Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 89 Impacts of Increased Heavy Precipitation and Sea Level Rise Land Transportation Modes The frequency,intensity,and duration of intense precipitation events are important factors in design specifications for transportation infrastruc- ture.Probabilistic estimates of rainfall intensities for a range of durations (5 minutes to 24 hours) for return periods,or recurrence intervals,of 20, 50,and 100 years have been used by civil engineers for designs ofroad cul- verts, storm water drainage systems, and road- and rail beds. Projected increases in intense precipitation events will necessitate updating design specifications to provide for greater capacity and shorter recurrence inter- vals,increasing system costs. The most immediate impact of more intense precipitation will be increased flooding ofcoastal roads and rail lines (Annex 3-1).Expected sea level rise will aggravate the flooding because storm surges will build on a higher base,reaching farther inland (Titus 2002).In fact,the chapter in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report on North America identifies coastal flooding from expected sea level rise and storm surge,especially along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts,as one of the most serious effects of climate change (Burkett 2002 in Field et al.2007).Indeed,several studies of sea level rise project that transporta- tion infrastructure in some coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic will be permanently inundated sometime in the next century (Dingerson 2005; Gornitz and Couch 2000; Leatherman et al 2000; Titus 2002).Low-lying bridge and tunnel entrances for roads,rail,and rail tran- sit will also be more susceptible to flooding, and thousands of culverts could be undersized for flows.Engineers must be prepared to deal with the resulting erosion and subsidence ofroad bases and rail beds,as well as ero- sion and scouring ofbridge supports.10Interruption ofroad and rail traffic is likely to become more common with more frequent flooding. The impact of sea level rise is limited to coastal areas,but the effect of intense precipitation on land transportation infrastructure and opera- tions is not. For example, a record-breaking 24-hour rainstorm in July 10Scour is the hole left behind when sediment (sand and rocks) is washed away from the bottom of a river. Although scour may occur at any time, scour action is especially strong during floods. Swiftly flowing water has more energy than calm water to lift and carry sediment downriver. Removal of sediment from around bridge piers or abutments (piers are the pillars supporting a bridge and abutments the supports at each end of a bridge) can weaken and ultimately undermine the integrity of bridges (Warren 1993).90 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 1996 resulted in flash flooding in Chicago and its suburbs, with major impacts on the urban area.Extensive travel delays occurred on metropol- itan highways and railroads, and streets and bridges were damaged. Commuters were unable to reach Chicago for up to 3 days,and more than 300 freight trains were delayed or rerouted (Changnon 1999). Pipelines may also be affected by increased intense precipitation. For example, federal regulations require that pipelines carrying hazardous materials in the lower 48 states be buried with a minimum of 3 feet of cover—up to 5 feet near heavily populated areas.Intense precipitation can erode soil cover and cause subsidence (i.e., sinking of the earth under- neath the pipeline).Scour and shifting of pipelines are a major problem in shallow riverbeds, where pipelines are more exposed to the elements (B. Cooper, Association of Oil Pipe Lines, personal communication, Dec. 7, 2006). Ultrashallow seabed waters can also be a problem if the pipeline becomes exposed and subject to potential movement and even fracture from continuing storm wave action. Changes in seasonal precipitation levels,with more precipitation falling as rain than snow,can be beneficial but can also create problems in certain areas.For example,California’s transportation infrastructure could be sen- sitive to even modest changes from frozen to liquid precipitation. When precipitation falls as rain rather than snow,it leads to immediate runoffand increases the risk of floods,landslides,slope failures,and consequent dam- age to roadways,especially rural roadways in the winter and spring months (du Vair et al. 2002). Navigable rivers with both rainfall and snowmelt responses would probably see greater winter volume flows associated with a greater risk of flooding (U.S.Global Change Research Program 1999). Marine Transportation Coastal ports and harbor facilities will be affected by increased intense precipitation and sea level rise.Landside facilities will be particularly vul- nerable to flooding from an increase in intense precipitation events and to the impacts ofhigher tides and storm surges from rising seas (Annex 3-1). Sea level with respect to dock level is an important consideration at both wet and dry docks,general cargo docks,and container berths for clearance ofdock cranes and other structures.Changes due to increased intense pre- cipitation and sea level rise could require some retrofitting of facilities.At a minimum, they are likely to result in increased weather-related delays and periodic interruption of shipping services.Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 91 The navigability of shipping channels is also likely to change. Some channels may be more accessible to shipping farther inland because of sea level rise. The navigability of others, however, could be adversely affected by changes in sedimentation rates and the location ofshoals.In other areas, a combination of sea level rise and storm surge could eliminate waterway systems entirely. For example, the Gulf Coast portion of the intercoastal waterway will likely disappear with continued land subsidence and the dis- appearance ofbarrier islands.This will bring an end to coastal barge traffic, which helps offset rail and highway congestion;all ships will have to navi- gate the open seas. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita alone destroyed 217 square miles ofcoastal wetlands.This loss represents slightly more than two-fifths of that which scientists had previously predicted would take place over the 50-year period from 2000 to 2050 (Barras 2006). The increased intense precipitation and periodic droughts predicted for the midcontinental United States will affect shipping on the Mississippi and Missouri River system.Increased precipitation could bring a repetition ofthe floods that devastated travel on the Upper Mississippi River in 1993. Droughts have a greater influence on commercial navigation on the lower portion of the river—from St.Louis to the Gulf—where there are no locks and dams and channel depths are entirely dependent on river flows. The 1988 drought, for example, stranded more than 4,000 barges, shifting freight to the railroads, which experienced increased business in hauling grains and other bulk commodities (Changnon 2006;du Vair et al.2002). In a recent study ofclimate change impacts on the lock and dam system on the Middle Mississippi, between the Missouri and Ohio Rivers, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concluded that the uncertainty associated with predicting future river flows called for a “wait and see,” monitoring approach rather than for expensive infrastructure improvements (Institute for Water Resources 2005). Nevertheless, feasibility studies for navigation projects have a 50-year planning horizon,thus requiring at least some con- sideration of the impacts of climate change and identification of the most robust strategies under a range of different possible scenarios. Air Transportation Several ofthe nation’s largest airports lie in coastal zones,built along tidal waters, sometimes on fill (Titus 2002). Their runways are particularly vulnerable to flooding and erosion from increased intense precipitation92 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation and, in the longer term, from sea level rise. Some airports, such as New York’s LaGuardia,are protected by dikes (see the discussion below of the Metropolitan East Coast Assessment),but others may require protection. At a minimum,increased intense precipitation is likely to cause increased disruptions and delays in air service and periodic airport closures. Impacts of More Intense Tropical Storms Climate scientists believe that more intense tropical storms are a likely effect of climate change. Three aspects of tropical storms are relevant to transportation: precipitation, winds, and wind-induced storm surge. All three tend to be much greater during strong storms.Such storms tend to have longer periods of intense precipitation;wind damage increases with wind speed;and wind-induced storm surge and wave action can have dev- astating effects. All modes of infrastructure are affected by more intense tropical storms.Sustained storm surge and damaging wave action displaced high- way and rail bridge decks during the recent hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, not to mention the loss of thousands of sign and signal supports. Shipping was disrupted,and barges that were unable to get out of harm’s way in time were destroyed. Airports were closed and sustained wind damage.Refineries were damaged,and barge traffic between offshore drill sites and coastal pumping facilities was suspended. The vulnerability of different transportation modes,as well as their resilience to intense tropi- cal storms, is well documented by the case study of the transportation sector’s response to and recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita dis- cussed later in this chapter. REVIEW OF ASSESSMENTS FOR PARTICULAR AREAS OR REGIONS Few studies have attempted to examine the potential impacts of climate change on transportation in a particular area or region.Those the com- mittee found are briefly reviewed in this section. The Metropolitan East Coast Assessment This study ofthe impacts ofclimate change in the tristate area ofNew York, New Jersey, and Connecticut focused on transportation infrastructureImpacts of Climate Change on Transportation 93 because of the enormous value of the Metropolitan East Coast’s (MEC’s) highly developed infrastructure to the region’s nearly $1 trillion economy (Jacob et al.2007).11With more than 2,000 km of shoreline and extensive areas of vulnerable residential development and business centers and sup- porting infrastructure,the focus was on the effects of sea level rise. The study used two global climate models,tailored to the MEC area,to describe possible future climate scenarios over the 21st century.12The pro- jections showed a potential rise in sea level of 0.24 to 1.08 m (nearly 0.8 to 3.5 ft) between the reference year, 1980, and 2080. More important, the combined effect of sea level rise and storm surge could result in flood heights for the 100-year coastal storm of 3.2 to 4.2 m (10.5 to nearly 14 ft) above the current reference height of 2.96 m (nearly 10 ft) for New York City. Thus, projected increases in sea level could raise the frequency of coastal storm surges and related flooding by a factor of 3, on average. Moreover,the return interval ofthe 100-year storm could shorten to as lit- tle as 4 to 60 years,depending on the climate scenario. Elevation maps of areas within the 3-m (10-ft) reference height above current sea level reveal that roughly 10 percent of the total MEC land area—portions of lower Manhattan; coastal areas of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and Nassau County; and the New Jersey Meadowlands— could experience a marked increase in flooding frequency (see Figure 3-1). Many critical transportation infrastructure facilities lie at elevations 2 to 6 m (6 to 20 ft) above present sea level—well within the range of current and projected coastal storm surges of hurricanes and more frequent nor’easters (see Figure 3-2).Most area rail and tunnel entrance points,for example,as well as three major airports,lie at elevations of 3 m or less.13 11The study, one of 18 regional components of the U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Changeorganized by the U.S. Global Change Research program under the Clinton administration, was one of the only assessments that examined transportation infrastructure. 12The two models used were the United Kingdom Hadley Centre model and the model from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis. For a more detailed discussion, see Jacob et al. 2000. 13Some of these facilities are protected but may need modification. For example, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), an active participant in the MEC study, built a dike and levee system to protect LaGuardia Airport. After the severe nor’easter in 1992, PANYNJ built floodgates to protect the Port Authority Trans-Hudson tunnel under the Hudson River, which had flooded and put commuter trains out of operation for 10 days (Jacob et al. 2007).94 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation FIGURE 3-1 Central portion of the MEC study area. Gray shading shows the areas at elevations below 3 m (10 ft) above present mean sea level. [Source: Jacob et al. 2007. (Copyright Elsevier 2007. Reprinted with permission of Elsevier Limited, Oxford, United Kingdom.)] The New York metropolitan area is no stranger to the devastating impacts of flooding. For example, the nor’easter of December 1992 pro- duced some of the worst flooding in the area in 40 years, resulting in an almost complete shutdown ofthe regional transportation system and evac- uation of many seaside communities (Jacob et al. 2007). More recently, heavy rainstorms in September 2004 and in August 2007 crippled the New York City transit system.Torrential rainfall (nearly 3 inches of rain in a 1-hour period in the 2007 event) overwhelmed the drainage system, designed to handle only about halfthat amount ofrainfall,sending water into the subway tunnels (Chan 2007).

Note that 10 ft equals approximately 3 m. [Source: Jacob et al. 2007. (Copyright Elsevier 2007. Reprinted with permission of Elsevier Limited, Oxford, United Kingdom.)] New York has focused on a worst-case scenario evacuation ofapproximately 2.3 million New Yorkers, many by transit, in the event of a Category 3+ hurricane. Flooding and storm surge will only be exacerbated by sea level rise. The New York metropolitan area is constantly rehabilitating and modern- izing its aging capital stock, providing opportunities to build in new protections against potential increased flooding.The MEC study proposes several measures,including incorporating sea level rise into the design,sit- ing, and construction of new infrastructure facilities or renovation of existing facilities;recognizing sea level rise in federal Flood Insurance Rate Maps used by many local jurisdictions for land use planning and con- struction regulations; instituting land use measures to prevent new or further development in highly vulnerable coastal areas; and constructing strategically placed storm surge barriers, similar to those in operation in teeF Holland JFK LGA Lincoln Passenger Tunnel Airport Airport Tunnel Ship Terminal96 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation the Netherlands and across the Thames River near London, to protect highly vulnerable and valuable areas. Climate’s Long-Term Impacts on Metro Boston Study The Environmental Protection Agency funded a 3-year project to study the potential impacts of climate change on infrastructure systems, including transportation,in the metropolitan Boston area and to recommend strate- gies for preventing, reducing, or managing the risk (Kirshen n.d.). The long-term economic success and quality of life of the region depend heav- ily on reliable infrastructure systems,which could be adversely affected by climate change.The concern is that global warming may result in sea level rise and increased flooding,higher peak summer temperatures,and more frequent and intense winter and summer storms with higher storm surges. At the same time,continued population and economic growth will result in increased development pressure on already vulnerable coastal and river- ine areas,increasing not only the amount of infrastructure at risk but also the amount of runoff that must be handled by area rivers, streams, and storm water systems (Suarez et al.2005). The human and economic costs of disruption to infrastructure sys- tems from flooding and storm surge in the area were dramatically illustrated by the devastating storm of October 1996. Drainage systems were inadequate to handle the 100-year storm. Backups and overflows affected several sections of the city, causing $70 million in property damage in addition to disrupting business and personal travel (Kirshen et al. 2004, 71). Portions of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and Northeastern University were flooded, as were a Green Line tunnel and four rapid transit stations, causing major damage and interrupted ser- vice for several weeks. The study analyzed climate change impacts on seven sectors, includ- ing transportation.14 The impact analysis for land transportation systems focused on flooding and impacts on the road system, emphasizing the effect on system performance rather than on infrastructure damage (Suarez et al. 2005). The methodology involved integrating projected changes in land use,demographics,economic activity,and climatic condi- 14The sectors were energy use, sea level rise, river flooding, water supply, public health (heat- stress mortality), localized systems (water quality, tall buildings, bridge scour), and transportation.Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 97 tions into the urban transportation modeling system of the Boston Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC).15The model was then used to simulate traffic flows for a range of different flooding scenarios for a base case year (2003) and a future year (2025),incorporating anticipated socioeconomic changes,as well as projected new links or increased capac- ity in the road network.16 Finally, the models were rerun to take into account the aggregate effect of increased flooding on delays and lost trips over the period 2000 to 2100.17 The results show that delays and trips lost between the baseline year 2000 and 2100 would increase by 80 and 82 percent,respectively,as a result of increased flooding attributable to climate change (Suarez et al. 2005, 240). Nevertheless, because of the large number of daily baseline trips in the Boston metropolitan area—approximately 14.6 million in 2000—these percentage increases represent relatively modest effects. The results also reflect the redundancy of the transportation network that is typical of a mature metropolitan area,which lessens but does not eliminate vulnerabil- ity. For example, although coastal areas are more densely populated, the road network is less redundant,so that residents are unable to make trips when the roads become inundated. In contrast, riverine floods result in increased vehicle miles and vehicle hours traveled. Travelers have more alternative routes available,but many are major commuter routes,thereby increasing congestion and time traveled (Suarez et al.2005). The report concludes that even if one uses high monetized values for lost trips and incremental delays,the impacts are “significant,but proba- bly not large enough to justify a major effort for adapting the physical 15MAPC forecasts population and employment growth to 2025 at the town level, providing the best available estimates of the spatial evolution of people and economic growth in the region. The study assumed that similar growth trends would persist up to 2050 and then remain constant. The Canadian Climate Centre and Hadley Centre climate scenarios used in the New England Regional Assessment—another regional component of the U.S. National Assessment—were superimposed over time series data on local weather conditions to provide the climate change predictions for 2001 to 2100 (Kirshen et al. 2004). 16Twelve flooding scenarios were developed to reflect different years of simulation, areas flooded (none, 100-year, and 500-year floodplains), and type of flooding (coastal, riverine, or both). Flood Insurance Rate Maps were used to identify coastal and riverine floodplains, and these were overlaid on maps showing land use and the road networks within the boundary of each traffic analysis zone used in the model (Kirshen et al. 2004). 17Two climate states were modeled—one assuming no climate change, projecting past trends into the future by bootstrapping from 50 years of rainfall and sea level data for the Boston area, and the second assuming climate changes in line with available climate model predictions. The difference in network performance between the two scenarios was attributed to climate change (Kirshen et al. 2004).98 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation infrastructure to expected climatic conditions,except for some key links” (Suarez et al.2005,231).The study,however,did not take into considera- tion the potential physical damage to transportation infrastructure and repair costs due to climate change that also must be part ofany investment decision. Seattle Audit of Climate Change Impacts Since the early 1990s, Seattle has been a leader in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005).Because the impacts ofclimate change are likely to persist well into the 21st century,however,policy makers have also recognized the need to develop appropriate adaptation strategies.Seattle’s Office of City Auditor initiated a series of reviews of how changes in the climate of the Pacific Northwest region would affect the operations and infrastructure of various city departments. The first review was focused on the Seattle Department ofTransportation (SDOT),which is responsible for the city’s $8 billion transportation infrastructure, including its roadways, most bridges,and bike paths (Soo Hoo and Simitani 2005). The primary changes predicted by climate scientists for the Pacific Northwest in the 21st century are warmer temperatures, rising sea levels, and increased winter precipitation.The study identified five potential types of impact. First, increased winter precipitation could lead to more flooding and landslides,which could damage the city’s transportation infrastructure and underlying utilities and hamper the mobility and safety of travel.18 More flooding,for example,could overwhelm the existing storm water drainage system,causing soil saturation and surface erosion.It could also exacerbate erosion of soil around roads,bridge footings,and retaining walls. Second, rising sea levels could affect the adequacy of seawall heights and bridge clearances. SDOT had considered sea level rise in developing design standards for a major Alaskan Way Seawall replacement project,but questions were raised regarding whether the projected sea level rise was underestimated. 18 Seattle Public Utilities has primary responsibility for responding to emergencies, such as landslides and surface flooding. However, SDOT is primarily responsible when the structural integrity of public streets, bridges, and retaining walls is threatened (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005).Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 99 Third, increased precipitation and temperatures and sea level rise would adversely affect bridge operations.More than one-third of Seattle’s 105 bridges are currently rated as being in poor condition.19Warmer tem- peratures could cause greater thermal expansion at bridge expansion joints, affecting bridge operations and adding to maintenance costs. Increased winter precipitation could exacerbate erosion around bridge footings,and rising sea levels could affect bridge clearances (see Figure 3-3). Fourth,warmer temperatures and increased precipitation could cause roadways to deteriorate.SDOT is responsible for approximately 1,500 lane miles ofarterial streets and 2,700 lane miles ofnonarterial streets.The city’s arterial streets are in good condition, but there is a backlog of repair and resurfacing projects. Climate changes could shorten street lives (Figure 3-3). Hotter summers could result in pavement softening and buckling and the appearance of heat bumps, although use of warmer- temperature asphalt mix could mitigate some of these effects. Increased precipitation would increase street flooding and tax drainage systems. Finally, warmer and longer summers and reduced summer precipita- tion would place stress on trees and landscaped areas in the city’s rights- of-way,requiring increased maintenance.20SDOT’s Urban Forestry unit is already considering the use ofdrought-resistant plants and other strategies to offset the negative effects of climate change. In response to the report, SDOT noted that it is including climate change as a factor in the scoping of new projects. It is also undertaking a new asset management effort that will focus on replacement cycles for all transportation infrastructure;climate change impacts will be considered as one factor in determining the adequacy ofproposed replacement and reha- bilitation projects (E. Paschke, SDOT, personal communication,April 14, 2006).That being said,SDOT noted that the long time frames and uncer- tainties of expected climate changes, coupled with maintenance backlogs and short-term planning horizons for operating budgets,justify “a prudent approach: one that combines watchfulness in following trends in climate 19 According to the 2004 Report of the Citizens’ Transportation Advisory Committee,37 percent of the city’s bridges are in “poor condition or worse,” and 4 percent already face weight restrictions because of critical deficiencies (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005, 20). 20 SDOT’s Urban Forestry unit maintains an inventory of 130 acres of land in city rights-of-way. Approximately 30,000 trees are located on city-owned land, with an estimated value of $100 million. Approximately half of the city’s landscaped areas are currently rated as being in good condition (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005, 24).100 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation (a) (b) FIGURE 3-3 Potential impacts of climate change on Seattle’s transportation infrastructure.

Finally, SDOT officials recommended an interdepartmental team to coordinate a comprehensive assessment of projections for sea level rise, as well as data on other issues related to cli- mate change, that could be used to revise existing or establish new and consistent standards reflecting climate change across all city infrastructure investment projects (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005). Alaska Alaska is already experiencing some ofthe effects ofclimate change,such as warming temperatures and continued shrinkage of permafrost regions— areas of permanently frozen ground below the surface layer—with conse- quences for all modes of land transportation.21Warming temperatures are also affecting marine transportation.Decreased concentrations and extent ofsea ice in the Arctic Ocean have lengthened the ice-free shipping season, expanded shipping along the Northern Sea Route, and opened the possi- bility of a Northwest Passage for shipping.22 At the same time, however, more open seas have exposed coastal villages along northern and western Alaska to increased storms and wave action,with attendant erosion.Coastal villages,along with their infrastructure,will need greater protection or may have to be relocated (G.Wendler,Geophysical Institute Climate Center,per- sonal communication,March 2,2006). As noted earlier, Alaska’s transportation infrastructure differs from that ofthe lower 48 states.Although Alaska is twice the size ofTexas,both its population and road mileage are more like Vermont’s. Of its 12,700 21Permafrost refers to soil, rock, or sediment that has remained below 32°F for 2 or more consecutive years (ACIA 2004). The 2-year designation is intended to exclude the overlying ground surface layer that freezes each winter and thaws each summer. Regions are classified into continuous permafrost zones, in which the permafrost occupies the entire area, and sporadic or discontinuous permafrost zones, in which the permafrost underlies from 10 to 90 percent of the land and may be only a few meters thick in places. Permafrost is further classified into two types: (a) cold permafrost, where temperatures remain below at least 30°F, and the introduction of considerable heat can be tolerated without thawing; and (b) warm permafrost, where temperatures remain just below freezing, and very little additional heat may induce thawing. 22The Northern Sea Route encompasses all routes across the Russian Arctic coastal seas to the Bering Strait. The Northwest Passage is the name given to the marine routes between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans along the northern coast of North America that span the straits and the sounds of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.102 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation miles of roads,for example,only about 30 percent are paved (U.S.Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003,28).The road and rail networks are concentrated largely in the south-central part of the state, near major population centers.Transport by air is much more common than in most states. Alaska has 84 commercial airports and more than 3,000 airstrips, many of which serve as the only means of transport for rural communities. The state also is home to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). Two recent studies (ACIA 2004; U.S. Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003) considered the impacts ofa warming Arctic on both Alaska and its infrastructure, particularly the effects on permafrost. The band of discontinuous,warm permafrost has been moving northward for some years.For highways,thawing of the permafrost causes settling of the roadbed and frost heaves that adversely affect roadway performance, such as load-carrying capacity. The majority of the state’s highways are located in areas where permafrost is discontinuous,and dealing with thaw settlement problems already claims a significant portion of highway maintenance dollars [M. Miles, Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (DOT&PF),personal communication,March 3,2006]. Nevertheless, a road rehabilitation cycle of about 15 years is sufficiently short to enable engineers to adapt to changing climate conditions. Thus, they are able to anticipate some problems created by thawing prior to con- struction and have developed a number of mitigation techniques.23 In addition, the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL),24in partnership with DOT&PF and the University ofAlaska,has developed a web-based geographic information system tool—the Alaska Engineering Design Information System (AEDIS)—for use in monitoring and design. AEDIS provides geographic-specific data on climate factors, such as precipitation levels,permafrost,and snow depth,that can be used to derive engineering design parameters (e.g.,load-bearing capacity),schedule maintenance, and select optimum transportation routes (T. Douglas, CRREL,personal communication,March 9,2006). 23For example, insulation can be placed in the road prism (area of road containing the road surface, cut slope and fill slope), and different types of passive refrigeration schemes can be used, including thermosiphons, rock galleries, and “cold culverts” (M. Miles, Alaska DOT&PF personal communication, March 3, 2006). 24The Civil and Infrastructure Engineering Branch of CRREL, part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, conducts applied research and develops innovative engineering solutions for facilities and infrastructure that operate under freezing, thawing, and extreme temperature differences.Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 103 Less flexible and longer-lived bridges and large culverts are sensitive to movement caused by thawing permafrost and are more difficult than roads to repair and modify for changing site conditions. Thus, designing these facilities to take climate change into account is more critical than is the case for roads (O.Smith,University of Alaska,Anchorage,personal communi- cation, March 1, 2006). Another impact of climate change on bridges is increased scour.Hotter,dryer summers have led to increased glacial melt- ing and longer periods of high streamflows, leading to both increased sediment transport on rivers and scour at bridge crossings.A network of sonars has been installed on several scour-critical bridges around the state, and the monitoring data are regularly sent to Alaska DOT&PF (J.Conaway, United States Geological Survey,personal communication,March 8,2006). Temporary ice roads and bridges are commonly used in many parts of Alaska to access northern communities and provide support for the min- ing and oil and gas industries.Rising temperatures have already shortened the season during which these critical facilities can be used (ACIA 2004). Like the highway system, the Alaska Railroad crosses permafrost ter- rain, but the railroad does not extend northward into the zone of continuous permafrost. While frost heave and settlement from thawing affect some portions ofthe track,increasing maintenance costs,major relo- cations of existing track will not likely be required (U.S. Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003). Alaska’s airports and airstrips are located throughout the state.A signifi- cant number ofairstrips in the southwest,the northwest,and the interior are built on permafrost and thus will require major repairs or relocation iftheir foundations are compromised by thawing (U.S.Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003). TAPS,which stretches from Prudhoe Bay in northern Alaska to the ice- free port of Valdez in the south,crosses a wide range of permafrost types and varying temperature conditions. More than half of the 800-mile pipeline is elevated on vertical supports over thaw-unstable permafrost to avoid problems of permafrost degradation, soil liquefaction, and land subsidence (U.S. Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003).Because the system was designed in the early 1970s on the basis of permafrost and climate conditions of the 1950–1970 period, it requires continuous monitoring, and some supporting members have had to be replaced. The Federal–State Joint Pipeline Office, which regulates TAPS, and the Alyeska Pipeline Company, which operates it, do not regard104 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation permafrost degradation as a problem,but this assessment does not take into account the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment predictions for the next 30 years (U.S.Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003). Arctic marine transport will benefit from climate changes. Obser- vations over the past 50 years show a decline in the extent ofArctic sea ice in all seasons, with the most prominent retreat in the summer (ACIA 2004).Climate models project an acceleration of this trend,opening new shipping routes and extending shipping seasons along Arctic coastlines, including Alaska. Improved accessibility, however, will not be uniformly distributed. For example, the navigation season25 for the Northern Sea Route is projected to increase from 20 to 30 days per year to about 90 to 100 days by 2080 (ACIA 2004,83).For trans-Arctic voyages,this route rep- resents up to a 40 percent savings in distance from northern Europe to northeastern Asia and the northwest coast of North American compared with southerly routes via the Suez or Panama Canal.In contrast,reduction in the extent of sea ice may create highly variable conditions in the Northwest Passage, reflecting the complex geography of the Canadian Arctic that could not be captured by the regional climate models used for the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment. In sum,recent climate change assessments show that Alaska is already experiencing the effects of climate change, particularly warming of the Arctic climate and thawing of permafrost. The effects are projected to accelerate during this century (ACIA 2004),and Alaska’s experience with adaptation may be instructive for some other cold-weather regions ofthe United States.Most ofthe state’s transportation infrastructure was designed for permafrost, and those systems with relatively short rehabilitation cycles relative to projected climate changes will have time to adapt to the changes. Nevertheless, projected changes are likely to require at best increased monitoring of climate conditions and higher maintenance costs,and at worst more major retrofits or even relocation of some facil- ities.According to one transportation professional,the greatest challenge lies not in dealing with the impacts ofclimate change but in not knowing exactly what changes to expect or when (B. Connor, Alaska University Transportation Center,personal communication,March 9,2006). 25The navigation season is generally defined as the number of days per year when there is less than 50 percent sea-ice concentration.Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 105 Gulf Coast The committee commissioned a special case study of the transportation sector’s response to and recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.26One of the primary objectives of this study was to examine the vulnerability of the transportation system to a major disruption, with a particular focus on the impact of an interruption on national-level movement of freight. The Gulf Coast is one of the key economic and population centers of the United States,home to more than 15 million Americans located in five states (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida) and three major metropolitan areas. The low-lying flat land along the Gulf Coast, skirting the subtropical waters ofthe GulfofMexico,makes the region vul- nerable to major hurricanes,more so than any other region in the United States.However,the geography that makes the coastal area dangerous dur- ing hurricanes also makes it attractive for industrial and commercial development. Several of the nation’s most heavily used ports are located along the GulfCoast.The Ports ofSouth Louisiana and Houston—among the world’s 10 most heavily used ports—are particularly attractive to inter- national shippers because of the area’s centralized location with respect to the rest of the nation and its wealth of transportation connections by pipeline, highway, rail, and river. The Gulf of Mexico also contains some ofthe largest U.S.oilfields and,with its large share ofdomestic natural gas and petroleum production, combined with its status as a major energy importer,is the epicenter of the U.S.petrochemical industry. Hurricane Katrina was the most destructive and costliest natural disas- ter in U.S.history,claiming more than 1,800 lives and causing an estimated $75 billion in damage.Hurricane Rita,exceeding Katrina in both intensity and maximum wind speed, claimed 120 lives and caused approximately $10 billion in damage.The significantly lower casualty and damage levels of Rita can be attributed to its easterly track, which spared the Houston metropolitan area from the worst of the storm.The unusually large losses of life and physical destruction of Hurricane Katrina resulted from a levee failure and the inability of the floodwaters to recede because so much of New Orleans lies below sea level.A failed evacuation plan for the car-less exacerbated the human toll. Both storms seriously disrupted transporta- tion systems. Key highway and railroad bridges were heavily damaged or 26This section draws heavily on the commissioned paper, by Grenzeback and Lukmann (2007).106 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation destroyed,necessitating rerouting oftraffic and placing increased strain on other routes,particularly other rail lines.Barge shipping was halted,as was export grain traffic out of the Port of New Orleans, the nation’s largest export grain port.The pipeline network was shut down,producing short- ages of natural gas and petroleum products. Despite predictions of long-lasting transportation stoppages,however, the majority ofthe GulfCoast highways,rail lines,pipelines,ports,and air- ports were back in service within weeks to a month (see Table 3-2). The worst-damaged bridges took 3 to 6 months to repair.Just three bridges that carry highway US-90 along the edge ofthe GulfCoast failed to reopen until mid- to late 2007,approximately 2 years after they were destroyed. The fact that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had only a modest impact on national-level freight flows can be attributed primarily to redundancies in the transportation system, the timing of the storms, and the track of Hurricane Rita.For example,truck traffic was diverted from the collapsed bridge that carries highway I-10 over Lake Pontchartrain to highway I-12, which parallels I-10 well north ofthe GulfCoast.The primary north–south highways that connect the GulfCoast with the major inland transportation hubs were not damaged and were open for nearly full commercial freight movement within days.The railroads were able to reroute intermodal and carload traffic not bound directly for New Orleans through Memphis and other Midwest rail hubs. Although New Orleans is a major rail freight interchange point for east–west rail traffic,it is not itself a major origin or destination for rail freight. Had Hurricane Rita struck a larger industrial and transportation hub such as Houston,the effects on rail transportation and freight movement would have been greater and more costly. Timing also played a role. The hurricanes struck before the peak of the corn and soybean export season.Most of the Mississippi River ports and the inland waterway were back in service to handle peak export demand later in fall 2005.Finally,the major pipelines suffered relatively little damage and were able to open within days,as electrical power was restored. The hurricanes’impacts on national freight flows may have been mod- est,but they were certainly not without cost.A full accounting ofthe direct costs to repair transportation facilities damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita has not yet been compiled. Reported costs of individual projects shown in Table 3-2 total more than $1.1 billion. Replacement of the I-10 Twin Span Bridge between New Orleans and Slidell, Louisiana, will add nearly another $1 billion, and the repair and replacement of rail lines,Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 107 pipelines,ports,waterways,and airports will likely add several billion more to the total.Moreover,the numbers do not include the costs ofunreported emergency operating expenditures,lengthy detours,the opportunity costs oflost shipments,and the long-term costs ofdisplaced business and trade. What lessons were learned about the vulnerability of the transporta- tion system from the experience with these two hurricanes? First,with few exceptions, the physical redundancies of a mature transportation system provided sufficient alternative routes to keep freight flows moving with- out major disruption.Where the infrastructure was privately owned (e.g., CSX Railroad), arrangements with other carriers enabled operations to continue.Ofcourse,this outcome might be quite different ifmultiple cat- astrophic storms were to strike major industrial and transportation hubs in close succession—a plausible scenario in a climate-changed world. Second, restoration of transportation services depended heavily on the availability of electrical power and manpower.Electricity is critical for the highway system to operate traffic lights and signs,for railroads to operate signal systems and crossing gates,for ports to operate cranes and elevators, for airports to power air traffic control facilities and operate nighttime run- way lights,and for pipelines to power pumping stations.Thus,redundancy of power and communications systems is also necessary for the rapid restoration and functioning of freight transportation networks.Similarly, adequate manpower is critical to timely efforts to restore transportation services and staff restoration projects.Because of the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Katrina, many public- and private-sector employees lost family and homes in the storm, and many others evacuated the region; New Orleans itself was closed for more than a month.Thus,major trans- portation companies such as CSX were forced to bring in workers from other locations to staff reconstruction projects. Finally, the storms have resulted in plans for relocating at least one facility and redesigning others in anticipation of future hurricanes. The Port of New Orleans is considering relocating companies and facilities to the main port area on the Mississippi riverfront from the deep-water chan- nel connecting the port’s Inner Harbor navigation canal to the Gulf,where they are more vulnerable to future storms.The cost ofthe relocation is esti- mated at $350 million.CSX has considered moving its vulnerable rail line inland—less as a response to hurricane threats than as a response to Mississippi politicians who are interested in the land for casino and hous- ing development (M.

For example, coastal areas and their infrastructure will be subject to the impacts of sea level rise, while the St.Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes may experience lower water lev- els.The infrastructure will experience impacts unique to each mode (e.g., scour on bridge supports), but many impacts, such as flooding and ero- sion,will be common across all modes.The condition ofthe infrastructure itself will affect the impacts experienced. Increased intense precipitation, for example, could cause accelerated degradation of the surfaces of roads in poor condition. As the examples in this chapter have illustrated, the impacts of climate change on U.S. transportation will be widespread and costly. According to the most recent scientific assessment, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, the greatest impact of climate change on North America’s transportation system will be coastal flooding, especially along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts,because of sea level rise,aggravated in some locations by land subsidence and storm surge (Burkett 2002).However,the rate at which these changes are likely to occur remains uncertain.The cur- rent IPCC projections do not include melting of the Greenland ice mass, for example,which could accelerate sea level rise. Projected climate extremes are likely to have a particularly severe impact on transportation infrastructure because the U.S.transportation system was built to typical weather conditions at the time and local weather and climate 27Hurricane damage to the Gulf Coast bridges resulted primarily from a combination of storm surge and wave crests that simply lifted bridge decks off their supports. Thus, FHWA recommended that a 100-year rather than a 50-year design frequency be used for Interstates, major structures, and critical bridges and that design guidelines take into consideration a combination of wave and surge effects. It was also recommended that risk and cost assessments be conducted (FHWA 2005 in Meyer 2006). New standards have not yet been agreed upon, so it is unclear whether they will take forecasts of sea level rise into consideration.Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 113 experience. Expected changes in climate extremes, such as more extreme temperatures,more intense precipitation,and more intense storms,could push environmental conditions outside the range for which the system was designed. This in turn could necessitate changes in design, materials, construction, and operating and maintenance practices. For example, increased flooding from more intense storms could require a combination of physical improvements (e.g., greater pumping capacity, more elevated bridges) and operational measures (e.g.,better flood warning and evacua- tion plans,better real-time micro-level weather forecasts). Climate change will create both winners and losers. For example, the marine transportation sector could benefit from more open seas in the Arctic,reducing shipping routes,times,and costs in the long run.In cold regions,expected temperature warming,particularly decreases in very cold days and later onset of seasonal freeze and earlier onset of seasonal thaw, could mean less snow and ice control for departments of transportation and safer travel conditions for passenger vehicles and freight. In all cases, transportation professionals will have to confront and adapt to climate change without knowing the full magnitude of expected changes.The greatest challenge is the uncertainty as to exactly what changes to expect and when. Thus, transportation decision makers will need to adopt a more probabilistic risk management approach to infrastructure planning, design, and operations to accommodate uncertainties about the nature and timing of expected climate changes—a major focus of the next chapter.

Challenges to Response T his chapter explores the challenges and constraints faced by trans- portation professionals as they begin to confront projected impacts of climate change.The chapter begins with an overview of how the U.S. transportation system is organized and how investment and operating decisions are made. These organizational arrangements and planning approaches influence how transportation decision makers consider the issue of climate change and help explain why responding poses difficult challenges—the next topic of discussion.A framework for addressing the uncertainties and analyzing the trade-offs associated with adaptation to climate change is then introduced.The chapter ends with the committee’s findings,suggesting opportunities for meeting the challenges to response. DECISION MAKING IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR Organization and Funding Responsibility for transportation infrastructure is decentralized and shared between the public and private sectors (see Table 4-1).Highways, bridges,and public transportation infrastructure are owned and operated by state and local governments.1Major funding for capital improvements— and in the case of public transportation, rolling stock (e.g., transit buses, railcars)—is provided by the federal government, with matching 1 Highways and bridges on federal lands are an exception, as are privately owned toll roads. In addition, the vehicles that use the highway system are privately owned, except for transit buses (see Table 4-1). 124Challenges to Response 125 TABLE 4-1 Transportation System Responsibility System Owner–Operators Capital Improvements Land Transportation Highways and bridges Infrastructure State and local governmentsa Federal funding for major highways with required local match Vehicles Privately owned and operated NA Public transportation Infrastructure Local governments and Federal funding with required independent authoritiesb local match Rolling stock Publicly owned and operated NA Railroads Infrastructure Privately owned and operated Private funding Rolling stock Privately owned and operated NA Pipelines Privately owned and operated Private funding Marine Transportation Inland and coastal Federal government through the Joint federal and nonfederal navigation channels, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers public funding, user fees St. Lawrence Seaway, and U.S. Coast Guard and associated navigation aid (all infrastructure) Ports and terminals Infrastructure State and local governments, Public and private funding independent authorities, and private entities Vessels Privately owned and operated NA Air Transportation Infrastructure Local governments and Federal funding, supplemented independent authorities with state and local grants and passenger facility charges Vehicle fleet Privately owned and operated NA Note:NA =not applicable. aThe exceptions are highways on federal lands and private toll roads. States are responsible for highways and bridges on major roads. Cities are responsible for major arterial streets in some metropolitan areas. bSome public transportation services are contracted out to private providers.126 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation requirements from other governmental levels.Railroads and pipelines are privately owned and operated,although the federal government has regu- latory oversight over railroad and pipeline safety.2 Ports are joint public–private operations. Typically, an independent authority or public entity owns the land and sometimes the landside facilities,which are then leased to private operators,generally on a long-term basis.Major improve- ments, such as dredging of harbors and channels, are federally funded through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with required cost sharing.3 The St.Lawrence Seaway system is jointly operated by the U.S.government and Canada through management corporations established expressly for this purpose, while the inland waterway system, including upkeep of the lock system, is operated by the U.S. government through the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers,also with cost-sharing arrangements.Airports are pub- licly owned and operated by local governments or independent authorities. At the major hub airports,the airlines often operate their own hangars and maintenance facilities. Many airport capital improvements are federally funded, supplemented with state and local grants and passenger facility charges. In sum, decision making in the transportation sector is a shared responsibility among many governmental owner–operators and the pri- vate sector,largely decentralized,and modally focused. Infrastructure Service Lives Transportation infrastructure is designed to perform for a wide range of service lives (see Table 4-2).4 Roads are among the shortest-lived facili- ties, with surfaces that must be repaved every 10 to 20 years.5 Bridges, locks,and pipelines are among the longest-lived—designed for a 50- to 100-year service life—although many of their components (e.g., bridge decks) must be rehabilitated more frequently. Transportation facilities 2 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates the siting of new natural gas pipelines, and the U.S. Department of Transportation requires 3 feet of cover at initial construction of an oil pipeline. 3 There is some privately constructed and maintained infrastructure (e.g., channels to private terminals, private berthing areas). 4 Service life can be defined as the length of time a facility will remain in use to serve its intended function. This will often exceed the facility’s design life or the period of time used for economic analysis of project benefits and costs. 5 Typically, the road base is far more durable, unless it is compromised by poor drainage or other adverse conditions.Challenges to Response 127 TABLE 4-2 Transportation Infrastructure Design Lives Expected Infrastructure Transportation Mode Design Life (years) Highways, bridges, and tunnels Pavement 10–20 Bridges/culverts 50–100/30–45 Tunnels 50–100 Public transportation Rail track Up to 50 Rail Track Up to 50 Marine transportation Locks and dams 50 Docks and port terminals 40–50 Air transportation Runway pavements 10 Terminals 40–50 Pipeline 100 Note:Design lives are averages. Much of the infrastructure operates far beyond its design life. Source:Meyer 2006. with shorter design lives provide numerous opportunities for engineers to adapt to the impacts of climate change,such as by use of more heat- resistant paving materials to withstand the more extreme temperatures projected for some U.S.regions.Opportunities for adaptation—for exam- ple,elevating a bridge to accommodate expected sea level rise—are fewer for longer-lived facilities, which are rehabilitated or retrofitted at much longer intervals. In practice, many transportation facilities perform well beyond their design lives.Moreover,the most critical decision is where to locate a facility initially.Once the right-of-way and alignment for a facility have been estab- lished, such as for a highway or rail line, relocating the right-of-way, as might be required in coastal areas experiencing sea level rise,would be enor- mously expensive.Thus,investment choices made today about the location, retrofitting,and rehabilitation oftransportation infrastructure will have far- reaching consequences for the ability of transportation infrastructure to accommodate climate change and for the costs ofany necessary adaptation.128 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Long-Range Planning and Investment Decisions For each mode, transportation professionals engage in planning for long-term capital improvements to infrastructure assets.Below is a brief summary of the planning process for publicly and privately owned infrastructure and the implications for addressing climate change. Publicly Owned Infrastructure Planning and investment decisions for publicly owned land transporta- tion infrastructure are made within the framework and requirements defined by the planning provisions contained in legislation; codified in Title 23,U.S.C.; and most recently amended in August 2005 by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users,known as SAFETEA-LU.State departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), working in coordination with local governments, have lead responsibilities for planning.6 The transportation planning process has two principal products:a long-range transportation plan and a short-term transportation improvement pro- gram. Because the infrastructure is largely in place, the vast majority of capital improvement projects involve retrofitting or upgrading the exist- ing transportation system or providing new capacity at the margin. Each state and metropolitan area with an MPO prepares a long-range plan, looking ahead 20 to 30 years. The plans incorporate forecasts of population, economic growth, and land use patterns to help determine the locus and extent of demand for passenger and freight travel and sup- porting transportation infrastructure needs. The second product—a transportation improvement program—provides a list ofshort-term cap- ital improvement projects, reflecting available funding, which is updated on a 4-year cycle. Joint Public–Private and Privately Owned Infrastructure Ports generally have a short planning horizon—5 to 10 years—because of the highly competitive nature ofport business operations.Analyses ofmajor capital improvements, however, such as landside facilities—warehouses, 6 The Highway Act of 1973 required the establishment of MPOs in urbanized areas with a population of more than 50,000 and dedicated a small portion of each state’s funding from the Highway Trust Fund for this purpose. MPOs are composed primarily of local elected officials whose purpose is to facilitate decision making on regional transportation issues.Challenges to Response 129 terminals,berths,rail links,and truck access roads—many of which have 40- to 50-year design lives, require forecasting of costs and expected returns over a much longer planning period.Similarly,the planning hori- zon for capital improvements to long-lived locks and dams along inland waterways is about 50 years. Airports have 20- to 30-year capital improvement plans for landside investments.Because many ofthese improvements are federally financed, the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as local airport authorities and local planners,is involved in the development oflong-range plans for airport infrastructure. The planning cycle for privately owned infrastructure—railroads and pipelines—is handled by individual companies through their capital budgeting process. Railroads are characterized by their capital intensity and large fixed investments. Even when a fully functional network is in place,large annual capital investments must be made to provide operat- ing equipment (e.g., locomotives, freight cars, maintenance vehicles, computer and signaling equipment) and maintain the physical right-of- way.7Capital budgets are part of strategic plans that look 5 years out and annual financial plans that identify the available budget for capital out- lays each year. Analyses of individual capital projects forecast costs and returns over 20- to more than 30-year lifetimes for major facilities,such as a double-tracking project or a new marshaling yard.8 Pipelines involve a large initial investment; assets are designed to be very long-lived (about 100 years);and there are few new entrants.Pipeline companies conduct market forecasts looking ahead 5 years at most. Planning for capital improvements follows the normal private-sector capital budgeting process (i.e.,project analysis using present value calcu- lations over asset lifetimes,minimum expected rates of return for project selection,and annual capital budgets). In sum, public and private transportation infrastructure providers are making short- and long-term investment decisions every day that have implications for how well the transportation system will respond to climate change in both the near and long terms. 7 These investments tend to be uneven or “lumpy,” however, because equipment, such as railcars, is purchased in batches. 8 Note, however, that discounting of future benefits at typical discount rates means that for financial purposes, benefits beyond, say, 20 years will be of diminishing importance.130 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Operational and Emergency Planning Transportation professionals in both the public and private sectors also engage in operational planning to respond to short-term congestion, delays,and disruptions to system operations.Transportation profession- als are keenly aware of the effects of weather on system performance and already address the impacts of weather on operations for a diverse range of climate conditions.For example,many departments of transportation have well-organized snow and ice control operations that can consume up to 40 percent of annual highway operating budgets in some northern U.S.states.Others are organizing to achieve better management of traffic congestion and incident control by establishing transportation manage- ment centers.9 Climate changes are expected to affect transportation primarily through climate extremes,such as more severe tropical storms and flooding from intense rainfall.One ofthe probable outcomes is the growing importance of transportation to emergency response and evacuation. The organiza- tional arrangements necessary to support this interaction are generally not well developed, although some regions have been more proactive in this regard. For example, Florida has a well-organized multigovern- mental approach to emergency planning and evacuation for hurricanes that includes transportation. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita provided a wake-up call to many governments in the Gulf Coast region,which have since improved emergency plans and evacuation strategies.The events of September 11,2001,were instrumental in focusing attention on the need for emergency plans and evacuation strategies and in underscoring the critical support transportation can provide. In practice, however, trans- portation is not always well integrated into these plans.Emergencies that involve multistate geographic areas and require a regional response are particularly difficult,as Hurricane Katrina illustrated (Deen 2006). In the longer term, critical infrastructure that serves as evacuation routes or egress points may itself be threatened by climate change. For example, highways in low-lying coastal areas could become endangered as encroaching sea level rise combines with storm surge to make these routes impassable. 9 For more detail, see the paper by Lockwood (2006) commissioned for this study. See also the discussion about transportation management centers in Chapter 5 (Box 5-1).Challenges to Response 131 CHALLENGES POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE Climate change poses a complex set of challenges that in many ways are new and different for transportation planners and decision makers, and this may help explain why there is little consensus on the issue or how to address it.10The lack ofa consistent response may also stem from resource constraints and an absence of adequate information and guidance. Differences in Planning Horizons Climate scientists describe the future in terms of outcomes that unfold over decades to centuries.One of the reasons for these long time frames is that the inherent variability of the climate makes it difficult to separate the “signal from the noise”in making short-term (i.e.,less than 25 years) projections. For many public-sector transportation planners, long-term planning horizons rarely exceed more than 30 years; 20 to 25 years is the norm.Port,rail,and pipeline providers have much shorter planning horizons—5 years at most for strategic plans—although many of their assets are designed to be much longer-lived, and capital project analyses reflect these longer time frames.Thus,many transportation planners per- ceive that impacts of climate change will be experienced well beyond the time frame of their longest-term plans,not realizing that climate changes are already occurring and that investment decisions made today will affect how well the infrastructure accommodates these and future changes. Treatment of Uncertainty The issue of climate change introduces uncertainties with which trans- portation planners are unfamiliar and uncomfortable.Climate scientists describe the future in probabilistic terms with a portfolio of plausible scenarios and outcomes that are constantly refined and revised as new knowledge accumulates.Uncertainties exist with regard to the rate of cli- mate change and the extent of its impacts,even for those changes about which climate scientists have the greatest confidence, such as warming temperatures and sea level rise. These uncertainties make it difficult to 10 See the paper by Dewar and Wachs (2006) commissioned for this study for a more complete discussion of many points made in this section.132 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation plan and design infrastructure that can accommodate these impacts.The likelihood of climate extremes and surprises only exacerbates the prob- lem. Moreover, knowledge about climate change impacts is likely to change over time,requiring a dynamic decision process that can adapt to new information and accommodate feedback. In contrast to climate scientists,transportation professionals tend to focus on “knowns.” Metropolitan transportation planners, for example, typically provide a single vision of the future on the basis of“best avail- able” forecasts of population, employment, housing, and development that drive transportation infrastructure needs. Infrastructure is built to meet the forecast demand, often without fully incorporating uncertain- ties associated with the predictions.Unexpected,unplanned events,such as earthquakes,hurricanes,and floods,challenge the system,but a com- bination of traveler adaptability and system redundancy has enabled transportation infrastructure providers thus far to maintain operations with surprisingly little disruption. Perhaps for these reasons,regional transportation planners appear to be satisfied with their performance.A national survey ofregional planning agencies,for example,revealed that the majority rated their performanceas acceptable and their models as adequate or better. Only a few, however, had simulated the effects of removing key links from their systems or assuming large and irregular fluctuations in traffic flows in some corridors, such as might occur iftropical storms become more severe or intense pre- cipitation and flooding become more frequent in some regions (Dewar and Wachs 2006). Poor Alignment Between Climate Change Impacts and Transportation Organizational Arrangements The decentralized and modally focused organizational structure of the transportation sector may not align well with climate change impacts, which do not always follow modal,jurisdictional,or corporate boundaries. Sea level rise and flooding from intense precipitation, for example, can affect individual transportation facilities, but they are also likely to have widespread impacts requiring the response of multiple infrastructure providers.Some climate changes,such as more frequent intense tropical storms (Category 4–5 hurricanes),will require regional or even multistate responses that transportation institutions are poorly configured to address.Challenges to Response 133 Regional planning organizations exist,but regional government does not. Multistate action is difficult,as Hurricane Katrina illustrated. Resource Constraints Climate change poses the possibility of significant, long-lasting impacts on transportation infrastructure and system performance that are likely to be widespread and costly in human and economic terms. Most other challenges confronted by the transportation sector,even extreme weather events such as Hurricane Katrina or earthquakes,cause significant damage, but the effects tend to be local and temporary.By contrast,climate changes in some U.S. regions may necessitate permanent changes. Over time, for example, roads, rail lines, and airport runways in low-lying coastal areas may become casualties of sea level rise,ultimately requiring relocation or expensive protective measures (e.g.,levees,which themselves would be sub- ject to catastrophic failure,as was experienced during Hurricane Katrina). Resistance to Change Transportation planners and engineers typically extrapolate from histor- ical trends to forecast future trends and conditions that influence their investment choices and operating plans. However, the past will not be a reliable guide for future plans and designs as they relate to climate.Climate scientists caution that climate change will usher in a new regime ofweather and climate extremes, likely falling outside the range for which many existing transportation facilities were designed. Faced with a new problem such as this predicted break in trend,trans- portation professionals typically adopt incremental rather than radical solutions.This tendency to favor proven methods and practices is under- standable, particularly for engineers, who are designing infrastructure expected to provide reliable service for decades,and in view of the uncer- tainties about the rate of climate change and the magnitude of its effects. Nevertheless, reinforced by conservative institutions, regulatory require- ments, and limited funding, this way of thinking can hamper timely responses to issues such as climate change that involve risk and uncertainty. Interviews with transportation planning officials conducted for the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (USDOT’s) Gulf Coast study by Cambridge Systematics,Inc.(2006) are illustrative ofprevailing attitudes.134 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation The interviews were conducted in spring 2006, when the impacts of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were very much on the minds of local plan- ners. Understandably, local officials were concerned with the immediate problems of rebuilding and recovery from the hurricanes. When ques- tioned about the possibility that climate change could bring about more storms of the intensity of Katrina or Rita in the future, however, many local officials expressed skepticism or pleaded ignorance. Others opted for a literal interpretation of SAFETEA-LU’s planning guidance, which does not require consideration of climate change, or pointed to federal policies that allow replacement of facilities only as they are currently designed, preventing consideration of design modifications that could provide for adaptation to potential climate change impacts (e.g.,elevated bridges to accommodate sea level rise, storm surge, and wave action).11 Some officials interviewed believed that Federal Highway Administration regulations prevented them from considering any changes that would extend beyond the time horizon of their long-range plans.12 Still others identified limited current funding that, in combination with uncertain- ties about the rate and timing of projected climate changes, disinclines planners to give more attention to the issue. Lack of Relevant Information Even those transportation professionals who are aware of the importance ofclimate change and are already addressing its impacts,such as the plan- ners and engineers in Alaska who are managing the effects of melting permafrost,indicate that they often lack sufficiently detailed information on which to take appropriate action. Climate scientists tend to describe projected climate changes in terms of global averages and confidence lev- els for global,continental,or large subcontinental regions because climate models have the greatest fidelity at these levels of analysis. In addition, studies ofthe impacts ofclimate change—with the exception ofthe hand- ful of studies reviewed in the previous chapter—have not focused on 11 The Federal Highway Administration, however, has granted exceptions and is rethinking its regulations and guidance for design of bridges in a coastal environment (Meyer 2006). 12 Section 6001 of SAFETEA-LU references a 20-year forecast period for long-range transportation plans. Many states and MPOs, however, are using a 20- to 30-year time horizon.Challenges to Response 135 transportation specifically,but on other critical sectors,such as agriculture, forestry,energy,and water resources. Transportation professionals need data at the finest-grained level of geographic detail possible because infrastructure is regional and local. Fortunately, the most recent assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) noted the improved capability ofclimate scientists to simulate regional climates and make robust statements about projected climate changes for many regions—a level of geographic speci- ficitythat is more useful to transportation planners and designers.Climate scientists should be encouraged to develop information on transportation- relevant climate changes that is as detailed as possible. Transportation professionals also have a role to play in helping to define what informa- tionabout climate change they need,such as temperature and precipitation thresholds,climate conditions that create unacceptable performance out- comes,and the like. A DECISION FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE How should transportation planners and engineers proceed in view ofthe challenges just outlined? A decision-making framework is needed that more adequately accommodates uncertainty and incorporates more prob- abilistic approaches to assessing risk and making investment choices.The basic concepts in such a probabilistic assessment include hazards,assets,and consequences,each of which is subject to uncertainties (see Annex 4-1).In the context of climate change,the hazards represent the potential threats from changing climate conditions,such as more extreme temperatures or more intense tropical storms.The assets represent the infrastructure and its value—both its economic value to the performance of the transporta- tionsystem and its physical replacement value.The consequences represent the susceptibility of the infrastructure to damage from the hazards,which in turn depends on the infrastructure’s design and state of repair,among other factors.Estimating future risk involves solving for the probability of occurrence of the hazards times the probable consequences if the hazards occurred,summed over all the transportation assets in a region.The objec- tiveis to minimize future risks. Transportation professionals already take risk into account,particularly in designing facilities,and in recent years more probabilistic approaches have been incorporated (Meyer 2006). For example, engineers design136 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation structures to withstand certain wind speeds on the basis of a probabilis- tic assessment of wind speed occurrence as measured by historical wind speed frequency.The 100-year storm is another example.Engineers often size the drainage capacity ofa transportation facility to handle a storm so severe that it occurs, on average, just once in 100 years. Adapting risk- based approaches to account for climate change poses new challenges. First,historical experience will not be a reliable predictor offuture climate conditions.Second,the hazards themselves are likely to change over time, but in ways that are not currently understood with any precision.Finally, attempting to hedge by simply designing to a more robust standard—say, a higher wind speed tolerance or a 500-year storm—will produce much more costly designs, likely to be unacceptable given limited budgets.13 A more strategic and selective risk-based approach that explicitly trades off the costs of designing for greater resilience against the costs associated with failure could help in setting realistic design standards and invest- ment priorities. California’s seismic retrofit program for bridges is an example of one way to proceed (see Box 4-1). Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989,the state was faced with the daunting task of how best to retrofit its stock of some 25,000 bridges. Earthquakes are a recurring problem, but there is considerable uncertainty about when or where a seismic event will occur.Moreover,the resources needed to retrofit every bridge to the highest standard or to conduct a physical inventory of all structures to determine which need to be retrofit are not available. The California Department of Transportation decided to proceed in the following man- ner.First,departmental engineers determined an acceptable performance standard or level of risk, reducing one of the uncertainties. For most bridges,that standard was “no collapse”under a maximum seismic event, consistent with the geographic location of the bridge.The objective was to avoid loss of life.However,some damage to the structure was accept- able as long as the structure itself remained intact and could be reopened 13 The committee is aware of the precautionary principle, which holds that “where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, the lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation” (UNEP 1992 in Whiteside 2006). The committee recommends that cost-effective measures to protect the more vulnerable transportation infrastructure be taken. However, the significant costs of redesigning and retrofitting much of the infrastructure to adapt to potential climate change impacts underscore the need for more strategic and selective risk-based analyses.Challenges to Response 137 BOX 4-1 California Seismic Retrofit Program for Bridges Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) faced the enormous task of prioritizing its inventory of structures throughout the state for seismic retrofit. Approximately 25,000 bridges on state and local highways required evaluation. Because of this large number of bridges, a simple and computationally manageable prioriti- zation methodology had to be devised. The goal was to identify and rank the most seismically vulnerable bridges in the state so the available resources could be used in the most efficient manner possible. The process began with establishing a required performance standard. For most bridges, the minimum standard was “no collapse” during a major seismic event to prevent loss of life. However, damage to the structure was acceptable provided that the structure itself remained intact and could be reopened for service soon after the event. The exceptions to the “no col- lapse” requirement were 750 structures for which the highest level of performance was desirable to protect the substantial investment in these major structures and ensure that they would remain in service after a major seismic event to provide access for emergency responders. The 11 major toll bridges, including the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, were handled sep- arately because their complexity necessitated a time-consuming dynamic analysis. A risk algorithm was developed for screening of the nontoll bridges. This algorithm was based on four major evaluation criteria: seismic activity, seis- mic hazard, impact, and vulnerability. Seismic activity was determined by locating structures in one of four fault activity zones, ranked from highly to minimally active. Seismic hazard was determined on the basis of specific conditions (e.g., soil) at the bridge site. Impact was based on such attri- butes as average daily traffic, route type, and detour length. Vulnerability was assessed on the basis of structural characteristics (e.g., structure type, structure age, presence of expansion joints) to assess the risk to the struc- ture itself. The score on each criterion was multiplied by a weighting factor—seismic activity and hazard were weighted more heavily—and summed with those on the other criteria to arrive at a final score. All 12,600 state highway bridges were processed by using this screening procedure and were prioritized by score. (The 750 major structures were flagged to be in the program.) Additional screening was required for 7,000 (continued)138 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX4-1 (continued) California Seismic Retrofit Program for Bridges bridges that failed to meet the minimum performance standard. These bridges were reviewed for specific deficiencies through an examination of the as-built plans for each. The second “paper” screening was used to determine whether the bridge was in the program or retrofit could be deferred; the goal was to make the program more manageable while still addressing the most urgent needs given the available resources. As a result of this second screening, 2,194 bridges were found to be in need of retrofit and were programmed for improvement. A final in-depth field inspection was performed, with the result that some bridges were found to meet the “no collapse” requirement and were removed from the list. A similar procedure was followed for the 12,400 local roadway bridges, resulting in 4,500 structures that required further evaluation and analysis. Since the program was initiated, 2,194 bridges on the state highway sys- tem have been retrofit at a cost of $3 billion, and the program is considered 99 percent complete. The remaining phase of the program consists of retro- fitting 1,235 bridges on local roadways at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion; the program for local bridges is about 60 percent complete. Funding is pro- vided through a combination of local funds, state gas tax revenues, statewide bond initiatives, and federal funds. Caltrans has maintained ongoing assessment of the seismic retrofit needs of its bridge inventory to identify structures with potential seismic vulnerabilities based on lessons learned since the program’s inception. The bridges identified through this process are prioritized and added to the program as required. State and local governments and private infrastructure providers could adopt a similar approach for identifying and screening critical infrastructure relative to projected climate changes. Key to adopting such an approach is establishing a performance standard for a particular facility that reflects a tolerable level of risk (a “no collapse” equivalent), along with a screening process that takes into consideration such factors as the degree of risk (e.g., magnitude of the hazard), the vulnerability of the facility, and how essential the facility is to the system so priorities for rehabilitation or retrofit can be determined.

The exceptions were 750 structures on state highways and 11 major toll bridges, which were held to a higher standard both to protect the substantial investment in these major struc- tures and to ensure that these vital transportation lifelines would remain in service following a major seismic event to provide access for emergency responders.Second,the experts devised a layered screening system to rate the structures most in need of retrofit; an in-depth physical inventory was conducted only for those bridges that did not meet the performance standard. Finally, elected officials were brought on board, and a combi- nation of funds—federal grants, state gas tax and bond funds, and local revenues—was employed to implement a long-term investment program that continues to this day. State and local transportation officials could adopt a similar approach to assess how climate change may affect transportation assets and develop appropriate adaptation responses and investment strategies.To begin,they might ask the following questions: • Which projected climate changes are most relevant for their region? • How are climate change hazards likely to be manifested (e.g.,flood- ing,storm surge coupled with sea level rise)? • Which transportation assets may be affected? • How severe must a hazard be before it becomes relevant and action is required? Can thresholds be identified? • How likely is it that a projected hazard will exceed the threshold, when,and where? • How much risk can be tolerated,or in other words,what infra- structure performance level is tolerable? • What level of investment (capital and operating) is needed to maintain different levels of service? Can acceptable performance standards for all modes of transportation be established? • Are there critical levels of service needed to protect health and safety? • Who is empowered to make these judgments and decisions? • What are the risks of adverse impacts or consequences if no action is taken?140 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX 4-2 Decision Framework to Address Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Infrastructure 1. Assess how climate changes are likely to affect various regions of the country and modes of transportation (assess hazards). 2. Inventory transportation infrastructure essential to maintaining network performance in light of climate change projections to determine whether, when, and where the impacts of projected changes could be consequen- tial (assess the vulnerability of assets and the system’s resilience to loss of assets). 3. Analyze adaptation options to assess the trade-offs between making the infrastructure more robust and the costs involved. Consider monitoring as an option. 4. Determine investment priorities, taking into consideration the criticality of the infrastructure component as well as opportunities for multiple ben- efits (e.g., congestion relief, removal of evacuation route bottlenecks). 5. Develop and implement a program of adaptation strategies for the near and long terms. 6. Periodically assess the effectiveness of adaptation strategies, and repeat Steps 1 through 5. • If action is necessary,how will investment priorities be determined? • Who will make the necessary investments,and how will they be funded? Answers to many of these questions can be found by following the six steps set forth in Box 4-2. This approach provides guidance on how to proceed in addressing many of the technical questions previously posed. However, it does not cover relevant organizational and political issues. Transportation officials must communicate the results of their technical analyses to senior management and elected officials,who make the policy decisions that guide funding choices.In the California situation,the Loma Prieta earthquake focused attention on the need for seismic retrofit of many of the bridges throughout the state to avoid catastrophic failure and loss oflife from such an event in the future.With climate changes,however, the impacts will not always be as unambiguously attributable to thoseChallenges to Response 141 changes or as dramatic,with the exception of extreme events (e.g.,severe tropical storms,intense precipitation events,heat waves).Thus,communi- cating the need for early attention to the impacts ofclimate change requires leadership, supported by compelling analyses, on the part of the trans- portation community. FINDINGS Climate change poses a complex set of problems, associated risks, and uncertainties with which transportation planners and decision makers are unfamiliar.Among the characteristics of climate change that make it particularly difficult to tackle are uncertainties about the rate and extent ofprojected changes;the fact that climate change impacts may not follow the modal,jurisdictional,or corporate boundaries of the transportation sector; and the fact that impacts may require coordinated regional or multistate responses that infrastructure providers are poorly configured to address. The significant costs of designing infrastructure to allow for adaptation to long-term climate change impacts in the face of resource constraints, the tendency of transportation planners and engineers to extrapolate from the past and adopt incremental solutions when ap- proaching new problems, and the lack of relevant information and guidance on which to base appropriate actions also affect how trans- portation planners and engineers view climate change. A change in perspective is needed. First, transportation professionals must recognize climate change as a credible and important problem so that champions will emerge to bring attention to the issue and to make col- laboration with climate scientists and meteorologists a priority. Second, addressing climate change requires a longer-term perspective and recog- nition that investment decisions made today, particularly about the location of transportation infrastructure, help shape long-term develop- ment patterns and markets well beyond the 30-year time frames of many public-sector capital improvement plans and private-sector capital budget- ing analyses.These decisions also affect how well the transportation system will adapt to climate change in the near and long terms.Third,the signifi- cant costs ofredesigning,retrofitting,and potentially having to relocate (or protect at great expense) some transportation infrastructure to adapt to potential impacts of climate change suggest the need for more strategic, risk-based approaches to decision making and infrastructure design.Such142 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation approaches should be better oriented to assessing the trade-offs between the costs of investments to make the infrastructure more robust and the likelihood and costs of facility failures or major disruptions to the system. The results of such assessments should be presented in a form that can be communicated to senior management and elected officials as a prudent action program, and provision should be made for adjustments as new knowledge becomes available. Finally, addressing the impacts of climate change that require regional and multistate responses is likely to entail developing new coalitions and organizational arrangements.Many ofthese changes will take time.Fortunately,transportation professionals have many avenues through which to begin to develop adaptation strategies,the topic of the next chapter.

Properly applied, PRA will likely prove an indispensable tool for transportation managers considering the potential impacts of climate change. CLASSIC RISK ASSESSMENT The central idea behind PRA is to define risk as the product of the magni- tude of adverse consequences and the probability that those consequences will occur.For instance,the risk ofthe loss ofa coastal road due to a storm surge would be the likelihood of a storm surge rising high enough to in- undate the road,multiplied by both the dollar cost ofreplacing the flooded road and the costs ofthe economic disruption during the time the road was unusable. In principle,transportation managers could use this risk definition to thoroughly assess the risks posed by climate change for their system.They could list the full range ofhazards associated with climate change for their region (e.g., sea level rise, heat) and then estimate the consequences that each hazard, if it occurred, would have for each transportation asset in their region.Each component ofthis equation has an associated probabil- ity.Thus,for example,there is a certain annual probability of occurrence for a 5-foot, 10-foot, or 20-foot storm surge; a certain probability that a road would fail if confronted by a 5-foot,10-foot,or 20-foot storm surge; and a certain probability that the economic costs of such a failure would be $1 million,$5 million,or $10 million. 143144 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation In sum,the risk due to climate change for all the assets in a manager’s system would be given by Totalrisk = ∑ Prob(hazard)×Prob(consequence) alllassets, allhazards where the first term represents the probability densities for each hazard and the second term represents the probability densities for the costs of each hazard (including the probability and the cost of failure) for each asset in the transportation system. Carrying out this analysis would provide transportation managers with an estimate oftheir total risk and the most important sources ofthat risk. (In practice, the probability of hazard is time dependent, and any future consequences for long-lived infrastructure would be discounted. However,this simplified expression is sufficient for the discussion below.) Note that the same contribution to risk can be made by a hazard with a relatively high probability of occurrence but moderate consequences and a hazard with a relatively low probability ofoccurrence but relatively high consequences. Such information provides a solid foundation for deter- mining the most effective ways to manage the risk. CHALLENGES OF ASSESSING THE RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR TRANSPORTATION ASSETS AND SYSTEMS In practice,it is difficult to carry out this calculation in its complete form. First,all the necessary data on the likelihood of the various hazards and their economic consequences may not be available. Second, significant uncertainty may be associated with the data that are available. Decision and risk analysts often distinguish between risk and uncertainty. In the former,knowledge of future events can be well characterized by proba- bility distributions.In the latter,decision makers may not view the best available probability distributions as very reliable. For instance, if trans- portation managers were completely confident that the climate is not changing,they might have high confidence in estimates of the probabil- ity ofmoderate-probability hazards,that is,those expected to occur every 10 years or less as gleaned from weather records for their region extend- ing back several decades or more. Managers might regard estimates of low-probability hazards, that is, those expected to occur every century, as less reliable. However, transportation managers have little basis forChallenges to Response 145 assuming that estimates of future climate-related hazards gleaned from past weather records in their region can serve as good estimates of the future likelihood of such events. They need to adjust their expectations on the basis of the results of probabilistic projections from climate mod- els.As discussed in Chapter 2,some hazard estimates from such models, in particular, estimates of the likelihood of extreme events, may be less reliable than others. The final reason that a comprehensive probabilistic risk assessment would prove difficult is that many transportation assets are long-lived, many of the most important impacts of climate change are expected to increase over time, and future transportation managers may take steps that can reduce (or perhaps unintentionally increase) the consequences of future climate changes.To address such changes over time,those who study the impacts of climate change identify four key factors that charac- terize the ability of a system to adjust to climate change.Using a slightly different language drawn from the ecological and biological literatures as opposed to the engineering literature of formal probabilistic risk assess- ment, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines these factors as follows: • Exposure,defined as the manner and degree to which a system is exposed to significant climate variations; • Vulnerability,defined as the potential for loss,or the degree to which a system is susceptible to or unable to cope with adverse effects of climate change; • Resilience,which refers to the restorative or regenerative capacity of a system when faced with change;and • Adaptation,defined as the adjustment made to a system in response to actual or expected climate change to mitigate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. Exposure and vulnerability are similar to hazards and consequences. System-level resilience is a particularly important concept in the trans- portation sector because individual assets function as components of a network.The consequences ofdamage to any one asset will depend on the ability of traffic to reroute by using other routes or modes.They will also depend on the speed with which the affected private transportation providers and public agencies (e.g.,state and local governments) can react146 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation and bring resources to bear to restore damaged systems to service. The resilience, or lack thereof, of the system can thus reduce or increase the consequences of damage to individual assets in the system. Adaptation will also be an important component of transportation managers’ ability to manage future risks associated with climate change. Managers today do not need to address the full range ofpotential impacts of future climate change because they can reasonably assume that future managers will take prudent steps to reduce the vulnerability oftheir assets and increase the resilience oftheir systems.However,some decisions made today can have implications that might make adaptation actions by future managers significantly more or less effective. For instance, some choices regarding the design and location of new transportation infrastructure may make it easier and less costly for future managers to adapt to climate changes if those changes turn out to be larger than currently expected.If there are two otherwise similar locations for a new road, for example, locating it farther from the coast will make it less costly for future man- agers to address any vulnerabilities of the asset should sea level rise turn out to be larger than currently expected. CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION MANAGERS IN PRACTICE The above factors—lack of complete data,uncertainty about the reliabil- ity of projections of future climate change, and uncertainty about the actions future managers will take to reduce the vulnerability and increase the resilience of a transportation system—make it difficult to conduct a comprehensive probabilistic risk analysis for a regional transportation system.In future years,more comprehensive planning frameworks can be expected to come into use that will help transportation managers inte- grate consideration of exposure,vulnerability,resilience,and adaptation factors.In the near term,however,a number of convenient and relatively simple methods can facilitate transportation managers’incorporation of these risk assessment concepts into their planning. For instance, the California Seismic Retrofit Program (see Box 4-1) provides an example of a simple screening analysis,based on the concepts of probabilistic risk analysis, that allowed the California Department of Transportation to prioritize seismic retrofit investments for approximately 25,000 bridges on state and local highways.The screening criteria focusedChallenges to Response 147 on both the vulnerability of individual assets and the resilience of the sys- tem.For instance,the program prescribed a higher performance standard for 11 major toll bridges,such as the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, whose loss would cause major economic disruption and whose replace- ment would be extremely expensive. Transportation planners can address the potential for future system adaptation by time windows. For instance, operational decisions will be focused on near-term changes in weather and climate conditions,such as more frequent and more extreme events (e.g., intense precipitation and flooding),with which transportation operators are already familiar.Retrofit decisions will determine the performance of assets for several decades and thus should use probabilistic climate forecasts that extend out for several decades to estimate hazards. Finally, land use and location deci- sions for new infrastructure may influence transportation systems for a century or more, so managers should use probabilistic climate projec- tions for future climate conditions extending into the 22nd century.The decision framework described in Box 4-2 provides one way to incorpo- rate such considerations. ROBUSTNESS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Particularly when they use multidecadal and century-scale climate projec- tions,transportation managers should pay heed to potentially significant uncertainties in these estimates.In particular,when transportation man- agers use probabilistic risk assessments to compare alternative design choices or even when they conduct a screening analysis,they should be aware of choices or rankings that are especially sensitive to particular probabilistic estimates.Engineers commonly incorporate safety factors into designs or design standards to account for unforeseen events or abnormal forces on structures.Similarly,transportation managers should recognize that it may be difficult for climate change projections to distinguish a future 100-year storm from a future 500-year storm,or that estimates of the likelihood that sea level rise will exceed 1 m by 2100 may change sig- nificantly in the years ahead. To the extent that they can make location decisions and design choices that account for such uncertainties in their risk assessments, today’s transportation managers will help future stew- ards of their systems minimize avoidable surprises.5 Meeting the Challenges A daptation to climate change would be necessary even if drastic mitigation measures were taken immediately to stabilize or even eliminate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (IPCC 2007).The effects of such global climate changes as warming temperatures and sea level rise occurring today reflect emissions of GHGs released into the atmosphere over the past century.Because ofthese long-lasting effects,the actions taken by transportation professionals today have implications for how the trans- portation system will respond to climate change in the near and long terms. The first section of this chapter is organized on the basis of timescales that transportation decision makers must consider in determining how best to adapt to climate change. In the short term (i.e., the next several decades), transportation professionals are likely to have operational responses to changing climate conditions and climate extremes.Operators of transportation systems already react to many climate changes,particu- larly extreme events (e.g., intense precipitation, intense tropical storms) and can rapidly adapt operating and maintenance practices for those cli- mate conditions projected to increase in frequency or intensity. Rehabilitating or retrofitting infrastructure requires a longer time hori- zon because engineers design many infrastructure facilities with long service lives in mind (see Chapter 4), thereby providing fewer opportunities for adapting to changing climate conditions without incurring significant costs. Adapting facilities for climate change may also involve the reevaluation and development of design standards—a process that typically entails a lengthy research and testing program. Finally, constructing new transportation infrastructure or providing major additions to existing transportation systems requires the longest time horizon. Transportation systems shape land use and development 148Meeting the Challenges 149 patterns, and in turn, population growth and economic development stimulate demand for new infrastructure facilities to support growth.In both cases,decisions made today about where to locate or expand trans- portation infrastructure establish development patterns that persist for generations and are difficult to change.These decisions should be weighed carefully to ensure that people and businesses are not placed in harm’s way as projected climate changes unfold. Following discussion of these topics,the chapter turns to many cross- cutting issues—flood insurance; monitoring technologies and new materials;data,models,and decision support tools;and new partnerships and organizational arrangements—that can help facilitate adaptation to climate change or bring climate change issues into the decision-making process.The chapter ends with the committee’s findings. ADAPTATION STRATEGIES Annexes 5-1A through 5-1C summarize a wide range of adaptation mea- sures that can be used to address many of the climate change impacts discussed in Chapter 3 (see Annex 3-1).Potential adaptations are identi- fied for land, marine, and air transportation, respectively, by response category: (a) changes in operations, (b) changes in infrastructure design and materials, and (c) other. No attempt is made to estimate the relative costs or effectiveness of these measures, although such analyses would be necessary to evaluate specific infrastructure investment alternatives. The remainder of this section addresses the key issues and opportunities for adaptation in each response category. Operational Responses The most rapid response to the impacts ofclimate change is likely to come through changes in transportation operating and maintenance practices.1 Every U.S.transportation provider already experiences the adverse impacts of weather on operations under a diverse range of climate conditions.For example, approximately 75 percent of air travel delays in the National Airspace System are weather related (L.Maurice and M.Gupta,presenta- tion to the committee, Jan. 4, 2007). Slick pavement and adverse weather 1 This section draws heavily on the paper by Lockwood (2006) commissioned for this study.150 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation contribute to nearly one-quarter of all highway crashes and about 7,400 fatalities annually.2In addition,snow,ice,rain,and fog cause about 15 per- cent of total delays on the nation’s highways (FHWA 2004; NRC 2004b). Weather also causes delays and interruptions in service for railroad and marine transportation.3 Transportation agencies expend considerable resources to address these conditions. For example, snow and ice control accounts for about 40 percent ofannual highway operating budgets in snowbelt states (FHWA 2006a).Hurricane response is a major focus of transportation operations in states bordering the Gulf Coast.Collaboration between departments of transportation (DOTs) and emergency response personnel has improved, particularly in those areas of the country subject to recurring natural disasters—the Gulf Coast (hurricanes) and California (earthquakes and wildfires)—but still has a long way to go. Climate change is altering the frequency,intensity,and incidence of weather events. Changes in Frequency ofExtreme Weather Events With changes in the frequency of extreme weather events, operational responses treated today on an ad hoc,emergency basis are likely to become part of mainstream operations. One could imagine, for example, that if strong (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes increased in frequency as is likely, widespread establishment of evacuation routes and use of contraflow operations4 in affected areas might become as commonplace as snow emergency routes in the Northeast and Midwest. Mainstreaming such responses will require expanding the scope of the traditional operating focus of DOTs on traffic and incident management to include weather management,as well as improved training for operating personnel. Increases in Intensity ofWeather Events Climate change is expected to trigger more extreme weather events,such as more intense precipitation,which are likely to produce areawide emergen- 2 Based on averages from 1995–2004 data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and analyzed by Mitretek Systems. 3 See, for example, Changnon (2006) on the impacts of weather and climate on American railroading and a report by the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research on the impacts of weather on surface transportation modes (OFCM 2002). 4 Contraflow involves the reversal of traffic flow on one or more of the inbound lanes and shoulders of roads and highways for use in the outbound direction to increase evacuation capacity in an emergency by using both sides of a roadway.Meeting the Challenges 151 cies and may require evacuation of areas vulnerable to flooding and storm surge.In the wake ofSeptember 11,2001,and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has mandated an all-hazards approach to emergency planning and response and encouraged better evacuation planning (DHS 2006).Coordination among state and local emergency managers—the first responders in an emergency—has improved, and emergency operations centers (EOCs) have been estab- lished in many metropolitan areas as command posts that can be activated rapidly in an emergency.Typically,transportation is a support function, but the critical role it plays in emergency response and especially in evac- uation—a role that is likely to become more important as the climate changes—should be strengthened through increased collaboration between emergency managers and transportation providers and more representa- tion of transportation agencies and private transportation providers at EOCs. Operators of transportation systems also need to work more closely with weather forecasters and emergency response planners to convey their own lead-time requirements for providing the necessary personnel and equipment in an evacuation and protecting their own assets.Finally,a greater emphasis on emergency management as a separate functional responsibility within DOTs and other transportation providers is needed. Regional transportation management centers (TMCs) provide one location through which collaboration between transportation providers and emergency managers can occur (see Box 5-1). TMCs are currently focused on traffic monitoring and incident management through rapid deployment of police,fire and rescue,and emergency medical services.In some metropolitan areas, new functions are being added, such as better weather information and greater use ofreal-time traffic advisories,as well as links with emergency managers.Some TMCs are also serving as EOCs. However, integration of weather and emergency management functions in TMCs is still in its infancy according to a recent U.S. Department of Transportation assessment (FHWA 2006b). Changes in Incidence ofWeather Patterns Climate changes will bring new weather patterns to previously unaffected areas of the United States. These changes, however, may not necessarily require the development of new operating and maintenance strategies. The United States has a diverse climate,ranging from subtropical to arctic152 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX 5-1 Transportation Management Centers Improving the efficiency of the existing highway network involves the appli- cation of technologies, such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and control strategies, such as ramp metering, dynamic message signs, and incident management. In many large metropolitan areas, these devel- opments have been accompanied by establishment of regional transportation management centers (TMCs), which are seen as the cockpit or nerve center for monitoring traffic incidents and providing rapid police response, crash clearance, and travel advisories. Many TMCs are manned by staff from mul- tiple agencies and jurisdictions working as a team. Some TMCs are focused primarily on traffic and incident management. Others, such as Houston TranStar, have a broader scope. Opened in 1996, Houston TranStar is a consortium partnership of transportation and emer- gency management agencies in the greater Houston area housing engineers, law enforcement personnel, information technology specialists, and emer- gency managers. In addition to traffic monitoring and incident control, emergency management personnel from the Harris County Office of Emer- gency Management monitor potential emergencies due to severe weather using state-of-the-art technology, such as flood warning monitors, Doppler radar, satellite imagery, and weather data from the National Weather Service, to provide the public with real-time information. The city of Chicago recently opened a new City Incident Center (CIC), which integrates the city’s homeland security efforts with traffic services, among other activities. CIC follows on the creation of a Traffic Management Authority in 2005, dedicated to improving traffic flow through ITS technol- ogy and centralized control systems. The new facility will have positions dedicated to traffic management but will also provide a central location for communication among dispatch operators from all the relevant city depart- ments so they can respond rapidly and effectively in the event of an emergency (Inside ITS2006). and from arid to wet, with several regions being subject to temperature extremes and such events as blizzards,hurricanes,tornadoes,floods,wild- fires, avalanches, and mudslides.As climate patterns change, the transfer of best practices from one location to another will be essential.A mecha- nism is needed to encourage such information exchange, involving allMeeting the Challenges 153 transportation modes. This effort should build on existing technology transfer mechanisms, such as the Technology Implementation Group of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).5 Design Strategies Operational responses are geared to addressing near-term impacts of climate change. To make decisions today about rehabilitating or retro- fitting transportation facilities, especially those with long design lives (see Table 4-2 in the previous chapter), transportation planners and engineers must consider how climate changes will affect these facilities 50 years or more from now.Adapting to climate change will also require reevaluation, development, and regular updating of design standards that guide infrastructure design. The purpose ofdesign standards is to provide engineers with guidance on how to construct infrastructure for safe and reliable performance.6 These standards represent the uniform application ofthe best engineering knowledge, developed through years of experimental study and actual experience.Often they become embedded in regulatory requirements and funding programs.7 Design standards embody trade-offs between per- formance (e.g.,safety,reliability) and cost.Faced with a myriad of factors that can affect performance,engineers typically select the most demand- ing parameter—the 100-year storm,the heaviest truck,the most powerful wind speed—as the basis for design,thereby building in a safety margin to minimize the chances of failure. Environmental factors are integral to the design of transportation infrastructure.Conditions such as temperature,freeze–thaw cycles,and duration and intensity of precipitation determine subsurface and founda- 5 The primary objective of AASHTO’s Technology Implementation Group, which grew out of an AASHTO task force’s successful effort to implement products of the Strategic Highway Research Program, is to provide leadership to state DOTs, local governments, and industry in the selection and promotion of ready-to-implement technologies. 6 This section draws heavily on the paper by Meyer (2006) commissioned for this study. 7 To be eligible for federal funding, for example, state and local governments must comply with federal standards with respect to lane and shoulder widths on highways and bridge clearances over navigable waterways. If the infrastructure is damaged or destroyed, federal agencies and insurers typically allow renovation or rebuilding only to replacement standards; upgrading is not a reimbursable cost.154 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation tion designs, choices of materials, and drainage capacity. The issue is whether current design standards are adequate to accommodate the cli- mate changes projected by scientists.Table 5-1 provides an assessment by Meyer (2006) of the principal climate-induced changes and their implica- tions for infrastructure design in both the short and long terms.Looking across all climate changes,the author notes that the most dominant impact is on those design elements most associated with forces resulting from water flows.This finding is not surprising in view of the extensive damage to transportation infrastructure and buildings caused by flooding and storm surge in Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Climate changes, however, will not affect the design of all infrastructure modes equally, a second important observation. For example, wave action is more critical than temperature changes for coastal bridge design. Finally, climate extremes, such as stronger wind speeds, increased storm surges, and greater wave heights,will place the greatest demands on infrastructure because they are likely to push the limits of the performance range for which facilities were designed. How should engineering design decisions be modified to address cli- mate change, particularly for longer-lived infrastructure for which the uncertainties are greater regarding the magnitude and timing of climate changes? One option is to build to a more robust standard, assuming a greater frequency and magnitude of extreme events,without a full under- standing offuture risks and presumably at greater cost.This strategy could be appropriate for major facilities in vulnerable locations (e.g., critical bridges and evacuation routes), but its high costs necessitate a highly selective approach. Another option is to upgrade parallel routes, but this alternative depends on the availability of right-of-way and the cost of upgrading.A third option is to build infrastructure with shorter design lives,presumably at lower cost,to be retrofitted as more knowledge about future climate conditions is gained.This alternative probably is not viable in the United States because ofthe disruption and negative public reaction resulting from more frequent retrofits of major facilities. Most states are adopting a “fast in,fast out,and stay out”approach to major reconstruc- tion projects.A final option is to hedge by building to current standards or making marginal improvements, recognizing that the infrastructure remains at risk and may require major improvements in the future.This alternative poses many of the same problems as the previous one.All four options involve important cost–risk reduction trade-offs that engineersTABLE 5-1 Climate-Induced Changes That Could Influence Transportation Infrastructure Design Climate-Change Changes in Phenomenon Environmental Condition Design Implications Temperature Rising maximum Over the short term,aminimal impact on change temperature; lower pavement or structural design; potential minimum tem- significant impact on road, bridge scour, and perature; wider culvert design in cold regions temperature range; Over the long term, possible significant impact on possible significant pavement and structural design; need for new impact on permafrost materials and better maintenance strategies Changing Worst-case scenario, Over the short term, could affect pavement and precipitation more precipitation; drainage design; need for greater attention to levels higher water tables; foundation conditions, more probabilistic greater levels of approaches to design floods, more targeted flooding; higher maintenance moisture content Over the long term, definite impact on foundation in soils design and design of drainage systems and culverts; impact on design of pavement subgrade and materials Wind loads Stronger wind speeds Over the short term, design factors for design and thus loads on wind speed might change; wind tunnel bridge structures; testing will have to consider more turbulent more turbulence wind conditions Over the long term, need for materials of greater strength; impact on design considerations for suspended and cable-stayed bridges Sea level rise Rising water levels in Over the long term, greater inundation of coastal coastal areas and areas; need for more stringent design stan- rivers; increases in dards for flooding and building in saturated severe coastal soils; greater protection of infrastructure flooding needed when higher sea levels combine with storm surges Greater storm Larger and more fre- Over the short term, need for design changes to surges and quent storm surges; bridge height in vulnerable areas; need for wave heights more powerful wave more probabilistic approach to predicting action storm surges Over the long term, need for changes to bridge design, both superstructure and founda- tions; changes in materials specifications; and more protective strategies for critical components a For purposes of this table, short term is defined as the next 30 to 40 years; long term is from 40 to 100 years. Source:Meyer 2006, Table 1.156 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation and planners can best address through a more strategic, risk-based approach to design and investment decisions,such as that described in the previous chapter. The approach taken by Transit New Zealand to deter- mine the necessity and feasibility of taking action now to protect the state highway network from the potential future impacts of climate change could also be instructive (see Box 5-2). More fundamentally,the scientific community and professional associ- ations must reevaluate design standards for transportation infrastructure that take climate change into account and begin the lengthy process of developing new standards where appropriate. Reexamination of design standards can be prompted by a single event,such as the damage to coastal highway bridges from Hurricane Katrina,when it became evident that the current state of practice—designing bridges for a riverine environment and a 50-year storm—was inadequate. The Federal Highway Admin- istration (FHWA) not only approved and shared in the cost of rebuilding the damaged bridges to a higher design standard but also recommended the development of more appropriate bridge design standards in general for a coastal environment that would take into account the combined effects of storm surge and wave action and assume a more severe storm event (e.g.,a 100-year or even 500-year storm) (FHWA 2005a).8 Typically, however, the development of design standards follows a time-consuming and systematic process that involves professional organi- zations in an extensive research and testing program over a period of decades. Once the standards are in place, engineers are understandably reluctant to change them.A combination of the length of time required to modify or develop new standards,the institutional procedures for approval of standards (vetting any changes through professional committees of practicing engineers), and the use of well-established standards as evi- dence of“good practice”in litigation leads to a conservative approach to change. Developing standards to address climate change in a timely manner thus will require leadership by the scientific community and professional associations and, given the scope of potential impacts, a broad-based,federally sponsored research program that must begin soon. A good model is the congressionally mandated National Earthquake 8 AASHTO and state DOTs are leading this initiative, and research on wave forces and wave load design practices is now being undertaken by universities and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Turner–Fairbank Highway Research Center, among others.Meeting the Challenges 157 BOX 5-2 Climate Change and Asset Management: New Zealand Transit’s Approach to Addressing Impacts of Climate Change Under the 2004 Resource Management (Energy and Climate Change) Amendment Act—New Zealand’s principal legislation for environmental management—Transit New Zealand was required to take into account the effects of climate change as it plans, constructs, and maintains the state highway network (Kinsella and McGuire 2005). The key climate changes of concern to state highways are sea level rise, coastal storm surges, and increased frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events. The primary assets at risk are bridges, culverts, causeways and coastal roads, pavement sur- faces, surface drainage, and hillside slopes. Transit New Zealand proceeded with a two-stage assessment to identify those areas requiring action. Stage 1 involved assessing the need to act now to manage future potential impacts of climate change. Three criteria were used: • Level of certainty that the climate change impact will occur at the magnitude predicted in the specified time frame, • Intended design life of the state highway asset, and • Capacity of the agency’s current asset management practice to man- age the impact. The results of the Stage 1 assessment revealed that current asset manage- ment practice is generally adequate to deal with impacts of climate change for most of the network, but that bridges and culverts with an intended design life of more than 25 years may require case-by-case consideration to ensure protection (Kinsella and McGuire 2005). Stage 2 involved assessing the economic feasibility of acting now to man- age future potential impacts of climate change and was focused on bridges and culverts with design lives of greater than 25 years. Making several sim- plifying assumptions, the analysis examined three options: (a) doing nothing, (b) retrofitting all existing bridges and culverts now to avoid future climate change impacts, and (c) designing all new bridges and culverts to accommo- date future climate changes to 2080. The analysis revealed that it would not be economical to retrofit the existing stock of bridges and culverts, but it (continued)158 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX5-2 (continued) Climate Change and Asset Management: New Zealand Transit’s Approach to Addressing Impacts of Climate Change would be preferable to repair the assets when a specific loss or need became evident. The primary reasons for this conclusion were uncertainties about where and when the impacts of climate change will manifest themselves and the historical number of bridges and culverts lost prematurely because of other events. Retrofitting all new bridges and culverts to take climate change into account was also determined not to be economical. Nevertheless, the agency decided that, where possible, provision should be made for subse- quent retrofitting (either lifting or lengthening the bridge) in the event impacts are experienced. For major bridges (and culverts) where retrofitting is not practical, the structure should be designed for projected future impacts of cli- mate change on the basis of the best available information (Kinsella and McGuire 2005). Transit New Zealand has amended its Bridge Manualto include consid- eration of relevant impacts of climate change as a design factor. In addition, the agency will continue to monitor climate change data and developments and review its policy when appropriate. Hazard Reduction Program,begun in 1977,which has provided much of the underlying research for seismic standards (see Box 5-3). New Infrastructure Investment, Transportation Planning, and Controls on Land Use One ofthe most effective strategies for reducing the risks ofclimate change is to avoid placing people and infrastructure in vulnerable locations,such as coastal areas.Chapter 3 described the continuing development pressures on coastal counties despite the increased risk offlooding and damage from storm surge and wave action accompanying projected rising sea levels. Many areas along the Atlantic,Gulf,and Pacific coasts will be affected.Once in place, settlement patterns and supporting infrastructure are difficult to change. In New York City, for example, a major concern of emergency planners is handling the evacuation ofsome 2.3 million New Yorkers from flood-prone areas in the event of a Category 3 or greater hurricane (New York City Transit 2007).Continued development of such vulnerable areasMeeting the Challenges 159 BOX 5-3 Development of Seismic Standards in the United States In 1977 Congress passed the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act, which established the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP)— a long-term earthquake risk reduction program. Member agencies include the United States Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology—agencies engaged primarily in research and development. The mission of NEHRP is broad and includes understanding the science of earthquakes and their effects, improving earthquake hazard identification and risk assessment methods, and developing effective prac- tices (e.g., model building codes) and policies to reduce earthquake losses (NEHRP 2007). One of the primary accomplishments of NEHRP has been the develop- ment of design standards for the seismic safety of buildings, both new and existing, which serve as a basis for national model building codes. Seismic standards and guidelines have also been developed for lifelines— telecommunications, transportation, water, sewage, electric power, gas, and liquid fuel lines. Adoption of the standards is voluntary, but some states, such as California, have incorporated the model national codes into state regulations, and the federal government has adopted the standards for its own buildings and as a prerequisite for obtaining federal funds. FHWA, for example, requires that federally assisted bridge and highway projects meet minimum seismic standards. The development of seismic specifications for bridges began in the 1970s with the San Fernando earthquake and was spurred by the occurrence of sub- sequent major earthquakes. For example, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake led the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to adopt a standard seismic specification for bridges in 1990. In response to the limitations of a “one-size-fits-all” approach, a modified performance- based standard was proposed in 1997, but it was rejected as being too complex and having too high a return frequency (2,500 years) relative to other hazards (Buckle 2006). (A performance-based national consensus standard has been developed for buildings.) Nevertheless, revisions are under way, and the performance-based approach, which takes into account different performance requirements and levels of risk, could be a model for the development of standards to address the impacts of climate change. A program such as NEHRP would be essential to fund the necessary support- ing research and testing.160 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation will only place more communities and businesses at risk and increase the difficulty of evacuation in the event of a major storm. Why do transportation planners fail to consider development patterns in making investment decisions? The short answer is that they do,but not from the perspective of land use control. Public-sector transportation planners typically forecast expected land use patterns over a 25- to 30-year period as the basis for modeling future travel demand and infrastructure investment needs (Meyer and Miller 2001).However,they rarely consider whether such investments are desirable, or what development may result from building or expanding transportation networks (Amekudzi and Meyer 2005).9Although the long-term capital improvement and budgeting process is different in the private sector (see Chapter 4),it suffers from the same limitations. One of the main reasons for the disconnect between transportation investment decisions and land use and development deci- sions can be traced to governance arrangements. Decisions concerning large-scale transportation infrastructure investments are the responsibility ofstates,regional authorities,and the private sector.Local governments and a few states (e.g.,Florida,California) control land use decisions through comprehensive plans, zoning ordinances, permitting, and building codes. Locally controlled land use planning, the typical situation in the United States,has too limited a perspective to account for the broadly shared risks of climate change. Local governments are interested primarily in the jobs and economic development that growth may bring to their communities, although in many localities, the costs of uncontrolled growth in terms of crowded roads and schools are being recognized.In some locations,greater integration oftransportation and land use planning is resulting from smart growth policies,which recognize the impact oftransportation investments on regional development and economic growth and vice versa; such inte- gration is not common,however. Transportation planners cannot resolve these issues single-handedly. The developers ofany strategy that involves imposing land use controls to address climate change would need to build consensus among key deci- sion makers in both transportation and land use,probably at the regional level—a challenging proposition.Nevertheless,if transportation planners 9 Meyer (2006) notes two locations—Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts—where transportation planners have identified environmentally sensitive areas that are off limits to new infrastructure and development, but these are the exceptions rather than the rule.Meeting the Challenges 161 were required to work more closely with land use planners and consider potential impacts ofclimate change in the development oflong-term invest- ment plans,the issues would become more visible. At present, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act:A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) encourages greater collab- oration and partnership among transportation planners and state and local agencies responsible for land use management, among others, in plan development.10 In the reauthorization of this legislation, such collabora- tion should be required,as should consideration ofclimate change impacts and their effects on infrastructure plans and investments, particularly in vulnerable locations. At the local level, some metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) have already begun to adopt more flexible, scenario-based approaches in developing their long-range transportation investment plans (see Box 5-4). The impetus has come in part from the desire to provide local communities with a framework within which to better understand the impacts ofgrowth and the difficult trade-offs among social, economic, and environmental goals in planning future transportation investments. Use of geographic information systems and modeling has enabled planners to illustrate and quantify the impacts ofa range ofregional growth scenarios on land use and area traffic,among other factors.At the end ofthe planning process,one sce- nario typically is selected as the preferred option. Development and monitoring of performance measures enable local planners to examine the effects oftheir choices and revisit the plans periodically to take into account new developments and changes in local priorities. Scenario planning could be adapted to take potential climate changes into account in the development of future regional transportation plans. For example,projections of current development patterns and supporting transportation infrastructure,when overlaid on maps showing current ele- vations and expected sea level rise, could illustrate the increased risks of allowing uncontrolled development in vulnerable coastal areas and the desirability of managed growth policies and protection of critical infra- structure.Climate scientists,perhaps at local universities,could assist in the 10 More specifically, Section 6001 and the Final Rule on Statewide and Metropolitan Transportation Planning (Federal Register2007) require that long-range transportation plans be developed in consultation with agencies responsible for land use management, natural resources, environmental protection, conservation, and historic preservation, and that state conservation plans or maps and inventories of natural or historic resources be consulted.162 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX 5-4 Scenario Analysis in Transportation Planning Scenario analysis as practiced by transportation planners is a process through which public agencies, private entities, and citizens work together to envi- sion the long-term future of their communities (FHWA 2005b). Scenario planning starts with a business-as-usual baseline scenario, incorporating cur- rent plans or trends for a region. Then, a range of alternative future scenarios is identified on the basis of community input, through the use of tools and transportation models incorporating geographic information to identify im- pacts both quantitatively and visually. Typically, one scenario is chosen as the preferred alternative and is adopted as the region’s vision for the future. According to a recent survey, MPOs are the lead sponsors of scenario plan- ning, followed by nonprofit organizations (e.g., environmental groups) and local governments (Bartholomew 2005). Numerous localities—Salt Lake City, Houston, Sacramento, Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago, among others—have adopted this approach. The recently released 2035 Regional Transportation Plan for Greater Houstonis a good example of the use of scenarios to examine the impacts of different land development choices on travel congestion, transit use, and population growth in floodplains and hurricane evacuation zones (Houston– Galveston Area Council 2007). Facing a projected 75 percent increase in population and a 60 percent increase in employment over the next 30 years, the council of governments for the greater Houston area—the Houston– Galveston Area Council—spearheaded the Envision Houston Region initiative in 2005 to engage elected officials, residents, and other stakeholders in planning and creating a long-term growth strategy to 2035. Four scenarios were considered, ranging from the status quo to a scenario assuming high- density mixed-use development along transit corridors and town centers; the latter is the selected Envision scenario, which planners believe offers a rea- sonable path forward and has considerable community support. The regional plan also is notable for taking the first steps toward integrat- ing climate change into the transportation planning process. The planners noted the vulnerability of the region to tropical storms and flooding, likely to be intensified by climate change and land subsidence, and the scenarios considered compared population growth in sensitive floodplains and hurri- cane evacuation areas. The chosen Envision scenario showed a reduction in population in both areas, alleviating demand on evacuation routes as com- pared with the baseline, status quo scenario.Meeting the Challenges 163 planning process by identifying plausible impact scenarios. University of Washington climate scientists, for example, developed projections of sea level rise for Seattle that became a consideration in designing a major reha- bilitation of the Alaskan Way Seawall.11 In those major metropolitan areas highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,where projected sea level rise combined with storm surge could threaten already densely developed areas—parts of New York City, Miami,and San Francisco,for example—options such as levees and storm barrier systems are likely to be considered to protect valuable real estate. These options are costly, they can create environmental problems, and they may provide a false sense of security.12 Moreover,as was the experi- ence in New Orleans, levees can encourage development in “protected” flood risk areas (ASFPM 2007).In small communities,exposure to impacts of climate change may necessitate abandoning homes, businesses, and infrastructure and relocating inland. For example, reduced sea ice along Alaska’s Arctic coast is already eroding shoreline and exposing coastal areas to the action of winter storm surges and waves,a pattern that will be exac- erbated by further sea level rise.Some 200 Native American villages are at risk and may soon be abandoned for inland locations (ACIA 2004). CROSSCUTTING ISSUES Flood Insurance Private insurers may be able to accomplish what government cannot in terms of land use control.Some major insurers,for example,are refusing to write new or renew existing homeowners’policies in areas already vul- nerable to hurricanes and other severe storms,which are likely to intensify in a warming climate (Adams 2006).Florida,Texas,Louisiana,Mississippi, Hawaii,New York City,and Long Island are among the affected areas thus 11 Sea level projections from the climate impacts research group at the University of Washington suggested that the city’s current design standards for the new seawall did not adequately account for the potential projected rise in sea level. Given the magnitude of the long-term financial and transportation impacts of the Alaskan Way Seawall project, the City Auditor’s Office recommended that the city obtain a comprehensive, independent analysis that would consider all available scientific sources in estimating the probabilities of expected increases in sea level and their rate (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005). 12 Levees interfere with the natural attenuation of flows from floodwaters, cause backwaters, generally increase the depth and velocity of floodwaters, and encourage channel degradation and eventual bank erosion (ASFPM 2007).164 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation far.Some states,such as Florida,have stepped up to become insurers oflast resort for coastal homes and businesses, but the high costs of providing coverage are unlikely to be sustainable or would result in prohibitive pre- mium increases in many cases if the costs were passed on to homeowners. Moreover, the provision of insurance in hazard-prone areas that is not actuarially sound is bad public policy. The federal government is already the insurer of last resort for home- owners and businesses that cannot secure affordable private flood insurance in flood hazard areas.In 1968 Congress authorized the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to mitigate increasing taxpayer-funded flood relief.The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) admin- isters the program and maps the nation’s floodplains;these maps serve as the basis for determining the eligibility ofhomeowners and businesses for NFIP funding.To become eligible,a community must adopt and enforce floodplain management ordinances and building code requirements to reduce future flood damage.13 In exchange,NFIP makes federally backed, affordable flood insurance available to homeowners, renters, and busi- nesses in mapped Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) through licensed agents and insurance companies. Flood insurance is required to secure financing for buying, building, or improving a structure in SFHAs. New buildings must be elevated to or above the predicted 100-year flood level, and foundations must be designed to resist flood loads (Elliott 2005). Buildings that are repaired or improved after floods must be brought into compliance with these ordinances ifthe repair costs 50 percent or more of the market value of the structure. Over the years,NFIP has been criticized for encouraging more devel- opment in these flood-prone areas than would have occurred without the program (Elliott 2005;Burby 2006).Others suggest that the program has had little impact because many properties (e.g., beach houses) are pur- chased without a mortgage and thus need not comply with floodplain ordinances.Communities have also been slow to enact and enforce flood- plain management measures. Finally, flood insurance is not required of properties located behind levees that have been certified for 100-year storms, even though such properties are at enhanced risk for any flood that exceeds the 100-year storm. Because climate change is projected to 13 Details of the program were accessed from the FEMA website at www.fema.gov/about/programs/ nfip.shtm on May 9, 2007.Meeting the Challenges 165 trigger more intense storms and sea level rise will extend the areas of flood damage in some SFHAs, FEMA and congressional oversight com- mittees should reevaluate the risk reduction effectiveness ofthe program. FEMA is engaged in a multiyear map modernization program to pro- vide reliable digital flood hazard data and maps in support of NFIP. However, the maps are based on historical data and thus do not take account ofclimate change.The SFHA boundaries are keyed to the 100-year storm,the base elevation data are inadequate (NRC 2007),and the pace of updating is slow.In fact,some states have taken over the task of updating to speed up the process. Further additions to flood zone maps may be needed and are particularly important to transportation engineers because these maps have become a quasi–design standard for determining appro- priate drainage capacity, for example, for transportation infrastructure in coastal areas. Monitoring Technologies and New Materials Better monitoring technologies and new materials could offer engineers alternatives to costly infrastructure retrofit or replacement in advance of climate change. For example, better systems for monitoring impacts of climate change on infrastructure could provide engineers with an early warning ofproblems,buying time for making the necessary modifications. This approach would also provide a good solution for less critical infra- structure facilities for which the costs of retrofitting in anticipation of climate change are not economical. In Alaska, where climate warming is occurring more rapidly than in the lower 48 states, engineers are closely monitoring bridge foundations for scour.Hotter,dryer summers have led to increased glacial melting and longer periods of high stream flows,lead- ing to both increased sediment transport on rivers and scour at bridge crossings.A network of sonars has been installed on several scour-critical bridges around the state. The monitoring data are sent regularly to the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (J. Conaway, United States Geological Survey,personal communication,March 8,2006), an approach that could be adapted for use in other states.14 Sensors and other “smart”technologies yet to be developed could also be used more widely to monitor changing climate conditions and issue 14 The FHWA scour program requires bridge owners to evaluate bridges for potential scour associated with the 100-year storm and a 500-year superflood event (FHWA 2005a).166 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation warnings when thresholds are exceeded.Sensors are already available that monitor changing pressures on a building or bridge and issue a warning when the pressures become abnormal (Meyer 2006).Sensors could also be embedded in pavements and bridge decks,for example,to monitor stress and strain as temperatures change, enabling remedial action to be taken before failure occurs.The collapse ofthe Minneapolis Interstate 35W bridge in August 2007 brought renewed attention to the need for better technolo- gies to monitor bridge conditions. Numerous technologies are available: X-ray machines can spot hidden cracks in girders,computerized monitors can track minute changes in stresses on steel beams,and sensors embedded in concrete can track corrosion ofsteel reinforcing beams.The costs are not small—one estimate to install monitoring equipment on a large bridge was $250,000—but relative to retrofitting or replacing a failed structure, the costs are marginal (Inside ITS2007).Advances in material sciences (appli- cations of nanotechnologies),15computer processing,and communications capabilities,as well as in sensor technologies,could provide a fertile field for the development ofdevices for monitoring climate changes and communi- cating the results to the appropriate infrastructure owners. New materials also hold promise for addressing some climate changes. For example,temperature extremes,particularly increases in very hot days and heat waves, are likely to affect both pavements and rails. Changnon et al. (1996) report that highways and railroads were damaged by heat- induced heaving and buckling of joints during the 1995 heat wave in Chicago.Extreme heat can also cause misalignment ofrail lines and derail- ments, although the use of continuous welded rail should prevent kinks from occurring (Changnon 2006). Continued research and development of materials that can withstand high temperatures would be productive,as would effective mechanisms for sharing new knowledge. Data, Models, and Decision Support Tools Data systems for monitoring the impacts of climate change can be an effective tool for determining appropriate adaptation strategies.One such system is the Alaska Engineering Design Information System (AEDIS), described in Chapter 3.AEDIS provides geographic-specific data on tem- 15 Nanotechnology is a field of applied science focused on control of matter on a scale smaller than 1 micrometer, normally 1 to 100 nanometers, as well as the fabrication of devices on this same scale.Meeting the Challenges 167 peratures, precipitation levels, permafrost, and snow depth collected from weather stations located around the state.The data are intended to help in deriving engineering design parameters (e.g.,load-bearing capac- ity), scheduling maintenance and repairs, and selecting optimum locations for transportation infrastructure (T. Douglas, Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, personal communication, March 9,2006).As trend data accumulate,AEDIS could provide a useful repos- itory of information on the longer-term impacts of climate change on infrastructure that could be linked with a database of response strategies and costs—from changes in maintenance practices,to use of new mate- rials,to design changes. Improving information on weather for transportation infrastructure applications is another important area for development, particularly in view of the potential for more climate extremes. The national needs assessment report ofthe Weather Information for Surface Transportation initiative (OFCM 2002)—a joint effort of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and FHWA—identifies as a par- ticular need more accurate information at higher spatial (e.g., surface temperatures) and temporal resolutions (OFCM 2002).The information must also be provided with sufficient lead time (for forecasts) and cur- rency (for observations) to guide operational decisions. Providing the data will require improved weather detection and forecasting; better understanding of thresholds for precipitation, temperature, winds, and the like, which affect transportation operations and, if exceeded, could cause significant interruptions in operations or infrastructure failure; and improvements in data integration and real-time communication to both transportation operators and system users (Lockwood 2006).Clarus, a major initiative of FHWA’s Surface Transportation Weather Program,16 is already working to develop and demonstrate an integrated nationwide surface weather observing, forecasting, and data management system.A range ofobservational technologies,from remote to fixed sensors to vehi- cle probes, are being tested as sources of real-time data, as is a suite of tools to make use of the data. Such efforts could have application for other transportation modes. 16 The Surface Transportation Weather Program was authorized in SAFETEA-LU for $5 million annually for 4 years. The primary focus is on alleviating the impacts of adverse weather on the safety and reliability of the nation’s highways.168 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation The 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons provided a vivid illustration of the need for improvements in modeling of the effects of storm surge and wave action,which will be aggravated by sea level rise.NOAA’s Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes model and, more recently, the Advanced Circulation Model (ADCIRC) (described in Chapter 2) have been used to estimate the threat from storm surge.17These models use historical input data that are infrequently updated. For example, when ADCIRC was run with input data through the 2005 hurricane sea- son, it was found that the magnitude of the 100-year storm-surge flood would now reoccur at an interval of75 years.After Hurricane Katrina,con- siderable research was also conducted on wave action on bridges (J.Krolak, briefing, Wave Force Symposium, Turner–Fairbank Highway Research Center,July 27,2006);the results of this research should help in revising coastal bridge design standards. If extreme weather events require evacuation of affected areas, better modeling to support evacuation efforts will be needed. Some MPOs are using travel demand models to estimate the time required to evacuate regional areas for different types of emergencies, but this is not common practice. For example, according to modeling estimates provided after Hurricane Rita by the Houston–Galveston Area Council,the council ofgov- ernments for the Houston metropolitan area,it would take 80 to 120 hours to evacuate 3 million residents from Galveston,Houston,and other coastal areas,assuming use of contraflow and optimum flow conditions.The nec- essary lead time far exceeds the ability of meteorologists to predict the landfall and trajectory of hurricanes (Houston–Galveston Area Council 2007), and this has led local governments to consider hardening public facilities on higher ground and encouraging residents in nonvulnerable coastal areas to shelter in place.Simulation models are also being used to help identify optimal evacuation routes, compute estimated evacuation times,and determine traffic management needs for an emergency planning area (Goldblatt and Weinisch 2005). However, these models must be upgraded to provide more real-time information to assist emergency man- 17 ADCIRC is being applied in southern Louisiana by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers New Orleans District to design levee heights and alignments, by FEMA to establish flooding probabilities for insurance purposes, by the State of Louisiana at the Center for the Study of Public Health Impacts of Hurricanes to operationally predict hurricane inundation, and by the Louisiana State Department of Natural Resources to assess coastal restoration projects (information from the ADCIRC website, accessed at www.adcirc.org on October 10, 2007).Meeting the Challenges 169 agers and transportation providers in responding to an incident (e.g., by changing routing instructions and notifying emergency response teams). New Partnerships and Organizational Arrangements Adapting successfully to climate change will require forging new partner- ships and organizational arrangements that better align with the impacts ofclimate change,which do not follow modal,jurisdictional,or corporate boundaries. As discussed earlier, decision making in the transportation sector is structured around these boundaries.Transportation planning is conducted primarily at the regional level, often in a bottom-up process that starts with local jurisdictions. Railroads, trucking, and waterborne commerce are largely private enterprises with varying levels of federal participation. Partnerships could involve closer collaboration between transportation agencies and emergency responders. Tabletop exercises, for example, in which emergency managers and critical transportation agencies, among others,role play their responses to hypothetical emergency situations (e.g., a terrorist attack,a major hurricane),provide an opportunity for such coor- dination and contact. Other relevant partnerships could involve local collaboration between university climate scientists and regional transporta- tion planners; greater interaction between transportation planners and those who control land use (both described previously); and creation of a more formal process for better communication among transportation pro- fessionals,climate scientists,and other relevant scientific disciplines,along with a repository for transportation-relevant climate change information. The creation ofregional and multistate organizational arrangements to address climate change is a formidable challenge but could yield enormous payoffs in the ability to respond not only to climate change but also to other natural and man-made disasters (e.g., earthquakes, terrorist inci- dents).The transportation sector has some models for cross-jurisdictional arrangements, such as regional authorities for specific facilities (e.g., the Alameda Corridor in California).18 Regional and multistate emergency 18 Created as a Joint Powers Authority by affected cities, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority guided the development of a 20-mile-long rail cargo expressway. The expressway separates freight rail from street traffic and passenger trains while linking the ports to the transcontinental rail network near downtown Los Angeles.170 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation response operations that include transportation are beginning to emerge in the wake ofhurricanes and other disasters,such as the events ofSeptember 11,2001.These might serve as the nucleus for multistate regional compacts to address other issues,such as the impacts ofclimate change (Deen 2006). State-mandated regional compacts for addressing regional air quality issues offer another model.19 One could imagine the emergence of similar arrangements to address such problems as the impact of sea level rise on coastal real estate and infrastructure in the tristate New York area or other coastal areas,the effects ofdrought on shipping along inland waterways,or the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region. The development of organizational arrangements “right-sized” to address the problems for transportation infrastructure created by cli- mate change may require state or federal action.The California Coastal Commission is a good example of a state initiative designed to resolve a regional problem.In the early 1970s,many Californians became alarmed that private development was cutting offpublic access to the shore and by voter initiative petitioned the state to exert its stewardship role to protect coastal assets for future generations. In 1976 the state legislature enacted the California Coastal Act and established a permanent California Coastal Commission, which plans and regulates development and use of natural resources along the coast in partnership with local governments and in keeping with the requirements of the Coastal Act (California Coastal Commission 2007).One could imagine a similar arrangement to mediate land use and development issues in vulnerable coastal areas in light of projected climate changes. FINDINGS Adaptation is unavoidable to address the impacts ofclimate change due to GHG emissions released into the atmosphere decades ago or longer.The prudent strategy is for transportation professionals to begin now to take a 19 In the eastern half of the United States, for example, where regional ozone is an important concern, organizations such as the Ozone Transport Commission and the ad hoc Ozone Transport Assessment Group were established, the former in 1991 under the auspices of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments. In the west, where degrading visibility in scenic areas is a growing problem, the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission and its successor, the Western Regional Air Partnership, were established as voluntary organizations representing western states, tribes, and the federal government. The main purpose of these groups is to recommend and implement multi- state mitigation strategies for air pollution that extend beyond any one state border (NRC 2004a).Meeting the Challenges 171 more proactive approach in addressing both past and potential future impacts ofclimate change.A wide array ofadaptation options is available. The most immediate response is likely to come through changes in transportation operating and maintenance practices. These changes will involve incorporating responses to more extreme weather events into routine operations, improving collaboration with emergency managers, recognizing weather and emergency management as integral functions of transportation agency operations, and widely sharing best practices. To make decisions about rehabilitating or retrofitting transportation infra- structure with long service lives,transportation planners and engineers will need to consider how climate change will affect these facilities 50 years or more into the future.Design changes may also be required to harden long- lived infrastructure in locations particularly vulnerable to climate changes. The development of new standards to address climate change will be a time-consuming process,requiring research and testing and the consensus of practicing engineers.In view of the myriad of potential climate change impacts to be considered, the scientific community and relevant profes- sional organizations should take the lead in initiating a program soon,with federal support for the necessary research and testing.Relocation of some transportation systems,such as coastal roads and rail lines,may ultimately prove necessary.Costly levees or storm barrier systems may be considered to protect valuable real estate in selected densely populated exposed areas. One of the most effective strategies for reducing the risks of climate change is to avoid placing people and infrastructure in vulnerable loca- tions. This is not always possible in highly developed areas, but more stringent land use controls and flood insurance requirements could help curb further development. Federal planning regulations should require that transportation planners take climate change into account in develop- ing long-range plans, as well as collaborate with agencies responsible for land use,so that the consequences of infrastructure investment decisions for land use and vice versa can be more clearly identified. FEMA should reevaluate the risk reduction effectiveness ofNFIP.At a minimum,updat- ing of flood zone maps to account for sea level rise (incorporating land subsidence) should be a priority in coastal areas. Better monitoring technologies and new materials could also provide alternatives to costly upgrading of some infrastructure.More widespread use of sensors for monitoring impacts of climate change and new heat- resistant paving materials are examples. More refined data (e.g., better172 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation elevation data for floodplain mapping, more accurate data on surface temperatures) and improved modeling—from weather forecasting to modeling of expected storm surge and real-time evacuation scenarios— are needed as well. Adapting to climate change will also require new partnerships and organizational arrangements that better align with climate impacts than do current modal,jurisdictional,and corporate boundaries around which decision making in the transportation sector is structured.Some models for regional and multistate cooperation exist in regional emergency response initiatives and in regional authorities and compacts for air quality, but state or federal incentives may be necessary to ensure the development of organizations “right-sized”to address the problems for transportation infrastructure raised by climate change. At the federal level,an interagency working group could be created, focused solely on adaptation issues for the transportation sector,to help shape existing agency research programs. The U.S. Department of Transportation would be the natural lead for this activity. Embracing these adaptation strategies would require overcoming many of the barriers outlined in Chapter 4. First and foremost, trans- portation leaders would need to agree that climate change is a problem that warrants action. Thinking longer term, adopting more risk-based approaches to investment decisions, and forging new partnerships and organizational arrangements are among the greatest challenges.The next and final chapter provides the committee’s recommendations for moving forward.

particular relevance for U.S. transportation, including the limits of current knowledge; to identify potential impacts on U.S.trans- portation infrastructure and operations; to consider adaptation options; and to offer recommendations on actions that can be taken to prepare for climate change and on needed research.In this final chapter,the commit- tee presents its consensus findings and recommendations in response to this charge,along with its principal supporting arguments.The commit- tee’s consensus position was informed by the five papers commissioned for this study; the 1-day conference held midway through the study to obtain the input of a broad range of transportation academicians and practitioners, climate scientists, and other experts; reviews of previous studies that examined the potential impacts of climate change on trans- portation,with a focus on adaptation strategies;numerous briefings on a wide range of relevant topics presented at committee meetings; and the committee’s own expertise and judgment. The chapter is organized on the basis of a series of questions that guided the committee’s thinking. WHICH CLIMATE CHANGES ARE MOST RELEVANT FOR U.S. TRANSPORTATION? Finding: The past several decades of historical regional climate patterns commonly used by transportation planners to guide their operations and investments may no longer be a reliable guide for future plans.In particular,future climate will include new classes (in terms of magnitude and frequency) of weather and climate 189190 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation extremes,such as record rainfall and record heat waves,not expe- rienced in modern times as human-induced changes are superimposed on the climate’s natural variability. Transportation planners and engineers typically extrapolate from histori- cal weather and climate patterns in planning and designing infrastructure. The past will not be a good predictor of future conditions, however, as climate changes bring new weather patterns and climate extremes that exceed current experience.Projections offuture climate are often depicted as gradual changes,such as the rise in global temperatures or in sea levels projected over this century. However, climate changes are unlikely to be experienced in such a smooth manner because human-induced changes will be amplified in some years by naturally fluctuating conditions, reflected in potentially sudden and dramatic changes at the regional or local level, where transportation infrastructure is located.Warming tem- peratures may trigger weather extremes and surprises,such as more rapid melting of the Arctic sea ice or more rapid rise in sea levels than is pro- jected by current climate models. On the basis of current knowledge, climate scientists have identified five climate changes of particular importance to U.S.transportation and estimated the probability of their occurrence during the 21st century: • Increases in very hot days and heat waves (very likely),1 • Increases in Arctic temperatures (virtually certain), • Rising sea levels (virtually certain), • Increases in intense precipitation events (very likely),and • Increases in hurricane intensity (likely). HOW WILL CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECT U.S. TRANSPORTATION? Finding: Climate change will affect transportation primarily through increases in several types ofweather and climate extremes, such as very hot days; intense precipitation events; intense hurri- 1The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) Working Group I established the following terminology to describe uncertainty, that is, the probability of occurrence: virtually certain, >99 percent; extremely likely, >95 percent; very likely, >90 percent; likely, >66 percent; more likely than not, >50 percent; unlikely, <33 percent; very unlikely, <10 percent; extremely unlikely, <5 percent.Summing Up 191 canes; drought; and rising sea levels, coupled with storm surges and land subsidence.The impacts will vary by mode oftransporta- tion and region of the country, but they will be widespread and costly in both human and economic terms and will require signif- icant changes in the planning,design,construction,operation,and maintenance of transportation systems. Transportation infrastructure was designed for typical weather patterns and environmental conditions,reflecting local climate and incorporating assumptions about a reasonable range of temperatures and precipitation levels. It will be affected most by those climate changes that cause envi- ronmental conditions to extend outside the range for which the system was designed. Finding: Potentially, the greatest impact of climate change for North America’s transportation systems will be flooding ofcoastal roads, railways, transit systems, and runways because of global rising sea levels, coupled with storm surges and exacerbated in some locations by land subsidence. Fully 53 percent of the U.S.population now lives in counties with coastal regions,many among the most densely populated in the nation.If devel- opment pressures continue in vulnerable coastal areas,and there is every reason to believe they will,the impacts of climate change will be magni- fied as increasing numbers of people and businesses are placed in harm’s way, and the infrastructure is expanded or new infrastructure is built to accommodate the growth. The Atlantic and Gulf Coasts are particularly vulnerable because they have already experienced high levels of erosion, land subsidence, and loss of wetlands. Their vulnerability to the storm surges and wave action that accompany strong tropical storms was amply demonstrated during the 2005 hurricane season.Sea level rise and coastal flooding also pose risks for the East Coast,as well as the Pacific Northwest and parts of the California coast. The impacts of climate change will not be limited to coastal areas. For example,watersheds supplying water to the St.Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes,as well as the Upper Midwest river system,are likely to experience drier conditions,resulting in lower water levels and reduced capacity to ship agricultural and other bulk commodities, although a longer shipping season could offset some of the adverse economic192 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation effects.Thawing permafrost in Alaska is already creating settlement and land subsidence problems for roads, rail lines, runways, and pipelines. Higher temperature extremes (mainly heat waves) in some U.S.regions could lead to more frequent buckling ofpavements and misalignment of rail lines. More severe weather events with intense precipitation could increase the severity of extensive flooding events,such as the storms that plagued the Midwest during the 1993 flooding of the Mississippi and Missouri River system, the Chicago area in 1996, and the Houston region during Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. Flooding of a waterway system can knock out barge operations on the river itself,rail operations on rights-of-way adjacent to the river, and even highway approaches to bridges crossing flooded rivers. Not all climate change impacts will be negative. For example, the marine transportation sector could benefit from more open seas in the Arctic,creating new and shorter shipping routes and reducing transport time and costs. In cold regions, expected temperature rises, particularly decreases in very cold days and later onset of seasonal freezes and earlier onset of seasonal thaws,could mean reduced costs of snow and ice con- trol for departments of transportation and safer travel conditions for passenger vehicles and freight. Recommendation 1:Federal,state,and local governments,in collaboration with owners and operators of infrastructure, such as ports and airports,and private railroad and pipeline companies, should inventory critical transportation infra- structure in light ofclimate change projections to determine whether,when,and where projected climate changes in their regions might be consequential. Inventorying transportation assets essential to maintaining network per- formance to determine their potential vulnerability to projected climate changes is a sensible first step. Information about projected climate changes is currently available from climate scientists for large subconti- nental regions—a scale more relevant than global projections for regional and local transportation infrastructure.Although such an inventory must be updated periodically as new scientific knowledge about climate change becomes available, inventorying is a relatively low-cost activity. Many of the tools needed for the purpose [e.g., geographic information systems (GIS)] are available. The inventorying process itself should help identifySumming Up 193 with greater precision the data needed on transportation-relevant climate changes and encourage collaboration between transportation profession- als and climate scientists. HOW SHOULD TRANSPORTATION DECISION MAKERS RESPOND? Finding:Public authorities and officials at various governmental levels and executives ofprivate companies are continually making short- and long-term investment decisions that have implications for how the transportation system will respond to climate change in the near and long terms. Transportation decision makers have an opportunity now to prepare for projected climate changes.Decisions made today,particularly those related to the redesign and retrofitting of existing or the location and design of new transportation infrastructure,will affect how well the system adapts to climate change far into the future. Many transportation facilities, such as bridges, large culverts, and rail and port facilities, are designed with long service lives and help shape development patterns that, once in place, are difficult to change. Thus, transportation planners and engineers should consider how projected climate changes in their regions might affect these facilities. Recommendation 2:State and local governments and private infrastructure providers should incorporate climate change into their long-term capital improvement plans, facility designs, maintenance practices, operations, and emergency response plans. Taking measures now to evaluate and protect the most vulnerable infra- structure should pay off by diminishing near-term maintenance expenditures and reducing the risk of catastrophic failure,with its toll on human life and disruption of economic activity. Such measures might include strengthening or elevating some coastal roads, rail lines, and bridges, particularly those that serve as evacuation routes, or upgrading parallel routes where they are available.2 In the longer term,relocation of 2States in particularly vulnerable regions such as the Gulf Coast could consider securing and banking rights-of-way for alternative evacuation routes, should they prove necessary.194 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation rights-of-way farther inland or installation ofcostly storm barrier systems to protect selected areas (e.g.,parts of New York City or Miami) might be considered. Finding:The significant costs ofredesigning and retrofitting trans- portation infrastructure to adapt to potential impacts of climate change suggest the need for more strategic, risk-based approaches to investment decisions. Designing transportation facilities to more robust standards to hedge against potentially negative impacts ofclimate change will produce much more costly designs that are likely to be unacceptable given limited budg- ets. More strategic and selective risk-based approaches are needed for determining appropriate design standards and investment priorities. Transportation professionals already take risk into account, particularly in designing facilities.For example,structures are designed to withstand certain wind speeds on the basis of probabilistic assessments of wind speed occurrence using historical data on wind speed frequency.Drainage requirements for many transportation facilities are sized to accommo- date the 100-year storm, a probabilistic assessment of storm frequency. Engineers also commonly incorporate safety factors into designs or design standards to account for unforeseen events or abnormal forces on structures.In general,however,transportation decision makers have a long way to go to take full advantage ofquantitative,risk-based approaches that incorporate uncertainty and probabilistic assessments in making invest- ment and design decisions. Recommendation 3: Transportation planners and engineers should use more probabilistic investment analyses and design approaches that incorporate techniques for trading off the costs of making the infrastructure more robust against the economic costs offailure.At a more general level, these techniques could also be used to communicate these trade-offs to policy makers who make investment decisions and authorize funding. At present,the necessary data and certitude about projections offuture cli- mate,particularly at the local and regional levels,are not available to permit a comprehensive probabilistic risk assessment and analysis.However,moreSumming Up 195 simplified approaches can be used by transportation planners and engi- neers to incorporate many of these risk assessment concepts into their planning and design. One model is the California Seismic Retrofit Program. Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, the California Department of Transportation developed a risk-based approach for ana- lyzing the vulnerability of highway bridges statewide to earthquakes and their criticality to the network to make it possible to determine investment priorities for retrofitting and replacement. The program established a higher performance standard for 750 structures to protect the investment in these major facilities and ensure that these vital transportation lifelines would remain in service after a major seismic event to provide access for emergency responders.The state’s 11 major toll bridges were handled sep- arately because their complexity demanded a time-consuming dynamic analysis. For most other bridges, the standard was “no collapse” under a maximum seismic event, consistent with the geographic location of the bridge.The objective was to avoid loss of life;however,some damage to a structure was acceptable as long as it remained intact and could be reopened for service soon after the event. Extending and incorporating such techniques to include climate change will require more complete data on the likelihood of climate- related hazards and their economic consequences. It will also necessitate continuing education of current planners and engineers and training of future professionals.Finally,educating policy makers to gain their support will entail communicating the information so that the trade-offs and investment priorities are clear.It may also require new eligibility criteria in funding programs, and new funding sources may also be necessary to make the investments identified by the application of these techniques. WHAT DATA AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS ARE NEEDED? Finding:Transportation professionals often lack sufficiently detailed information about expected climate changes and their timing to take appropriate action. Transportation decision makers note that one of the most difficult aspects of addressing climate change is obtaining the relevant information in the form they need for planning and design.This difficulty is not limited to the transportation sector. A recent National Research Council report (NRC196 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 2007) found that while the scientific understanding of climate change has made great progress,the use ofthat knowledge to support decision making and formulate mitigation and adaptation strategies is much less well devel- oped.Climate change is understood with greatest confidence as a global or continental phenomenon, while transportation planners as well as other decision makers need local and regional climate projections. They also need a better understanding of how projected climate changes, such as changes in temperature and precipitation,will affect the environment (e.g., soil moisture, runoff) in which the infrastructure is situated, which will vary from region to region. Climate projections themselves are presented by climate scientists as a portfolio of plausible scenarios and outcomes, which are continually refined and revised as new knowledge accumulates. Transportation planners need to have a better understanding ofwhich sce- narios are most plausible for their regions and most significant for their operations and plans. Recommendation 4:The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), the U.S. Geological Survey, and other relevant agencies should work together to institute a process for bet- ter communication among transportation professionals, climate scientists, and other relevant scientific disciplines, and establish a clearinghouse for transportation-relevant cli- mate change information. All professions should benefit from the collaboration.Transportation pro- fessionals would be encouraged to define with greater precision the climate data needed to improve transportation decisions,such as temperature and precipitation thresholds at finer-grained geographic scales or climate con- ditions that would create unacceptable performance outcomes. Climate scientists would be challenged to elaborate on the possibilities and limita- tions of projecting impacts of climate change at the levels of geographic specificity that are most useful for transportation planners.And hydrolo- gists and others would be challenged to consider how the environment would influence these effects and their impacts on transportation infra- structure.One promising approach might be for the federal government to support a number of pilot projects in which federal agencies would work closely with local transportation planners to include the full range of rele- vant climate information that could affect a specific project.Summing Up 197 Finding: Better decision support tools are also needed to assist transportation decision makers. Recommendation 5: Ongoing and planned research at fed- eral and state agencies and universities that provide climate data and decision support tools should include the needs of transportation decision makers. For example, the research program of the USDOT Center for Climate Change and Environmental Forecasting could be charged with expanding its existing research program in this area and provided the necessary fund- ing.Needed tools include accurate digital elevation maps in coastal areas for forecasting the effects offlooding and storm surge heights;GIS that can be used to map the locations of critical infrastructure,overlaid with informa- tion on climate change effects (e.g.,sea level rise,permafrost melt);greater use of scenarios that include climate change in the development of long- range regional transportation plans to pinpoint likely vulnerabilities (e.g., areas susceptible to sea level rise,aggravated by storm surge) and ways to address them;and better transportation network models for examining the systemwide effects ofthe loss ofcritical transportation infrastructure links. WHICH ADAPTATION STRATEGIES MAKE SENSE? Transportation decision makers have a wide range of adaptation options from which to choose in determining how best to adjust to climate change.One way to organize these options is around the timescales used by transportation professionals in their decision making. For example, operational decisions are typically focused on the short term and thus will be concerned mainly with near-term changes in weather and climate con- ditions. Decisions about rehabilitating or retrofitting infrastructure are made with a longer time horizon in mind.Such decisions will determine the performance of those assets with long service lives for many decades and thus should take longer-term climate projections into consideration so likely hazards can be assessed. Decisions about new infrastructure or major capacity additions involve the longest time frame because they will shape land use and development patterns for years to come and thus may require consideration of climate change projections that extend into the 22nd century. Other adaptation options, such as monitoring and use of technology or new organizational arrangements,cut across timescales and198 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation offer adaptation options in their own right or ways to better incorporate climate change in transportation decision making. Operational Responses Finding: Projected increases in extreme weather and climate underscore the importance of emergency response plans in vul- nerable locations and require that transportation providers work more closely with weather forecasters and emergency planners and assume a greater role in evacuation planning and emergency response. U.S. transportation providers already address the impacts of weather on transportation system operations in a diverse range ofclimatic conditions. For example,snow and ice control accounts for about 40 percent ofannual highway operating budgets in the northern U.S.states.Likewise,hurricane planning has become a major focus of transportation operations in the Gulf Coast states, where transportation providers are forging close rela- tionships with emergency responders to handle severe weather events. As climate changes induce new extremes (e.g., more intense storms, more intense precipitation), operational responses are likely to become more routine and proactive than today’s approach of treating severe weather on an ad hoc, emergency basis. For example, if hurricanes increase in intensity,as is likely to be the case,establishment ofevacuation routes and use of contraflow operations may become as commonplace as the current use of snow emergency routes in the Northeast and Midwest. More accurate and timely weather prediction and communication of storm warnings in real time to those potentially in harm’s way will become more important. Recommendation 6: Transportation agencies and service providers should build on the experience in those locations where transportation is well integrated into emergency response and evacuation plans. Following the events of September 11, 2001, and the experience with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, coordination between state and local emergency managers—the first responders in an emergency—and transportation agencies and service providers improved, particularly inSumming Up 199 those locations with recurring natural disasters, such as hurricanes. In some locations, transportation is represented at emergency operations centers—command posts that can be activated rapidly in an emergency. Transportation agencies and service providers are also working closely with weather forecasters and emergency response planners to convey their own lead-time requirements so they can provide the personnel and equipment necessary for evacuation and protect their own assets. Transportation agencies and service providers in locations where collab- oration is not as advanced should build on this experience. Monitoring and Use of Technology Finding: Greater use of technology would enable infrastructure providers to monitor climate changes and receive advance warn- ing of potential failures due to water levels and currents, wave action, winds, and temperatures exceeding what the infrastruc- ture was designed to withstand. Monitoring infrastructure conditions,particularly the impacts of weather and climate extremes, offers an alternative to preventive retrofitting or reconstruction ofsome facilities.It is also an activity that can begin imme- diately.In Alaska,which is experiencing more accelerated climate changes than the lower 48 states,the Alyeska Pipeline Company already monitors the right-of-way of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to spot land subsi- dence problems, particularly along the 800 miles of pipeline elevated on vertical supports.Alaskan engineers also closely monitor bridge supports, which are experiencing damage from earlier winter runoff and increased stream flow.In the future,sensors and other “smart”technologies could be embedded in the infrastructure to monitor changing climate conditions and impacts and provide warning when pressure or stress thresholds are being exceeded.Development of more heat-resistant materials could help protect pavements and some rail facilities,in particular,from the adverse impacts of projected temperature extremes. Recommendation 7:Federal and academic research programs should encourage the development and implementation of monitoring technologies that could provide advance warning of pending failures due to the effects of weather and climate extremes on major transportation facilities.200 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Advances in sensor technologies,computer processing,and communica- tions capabilities should provide a fertile field for the development of smart devices that can be used for monitoring changing climate condi- tions and communicating the results to the appropriate transportation infrastructure owners. Advances in material sciences should enable the development of new materials that can withstand climate extremes. Sharing of Best Practices Finding:The geographic extent ofthe United States—from Alaska to Florida and from Maine to Hawaii—and its diversity ofweather and climate conditions can provide a laboratory for identifying best practices and sharing information as the climate changes. As a result of climate change,many areas of the United States will expe- rience new climate-induced weather patterns. These changes, however, may not necessarily require the development ofnew operating and main- tenance strategies.The United States has a diverse climate,ranging from subtropical to arctic and from arid to wet,with several regions being sub- ject to temperature extremes and such events as blizzards, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, avalanches, and mudslides. As climate pat- terns change,transfer of best practices from one location to another will be essential. Recommendation 8: The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO),the Federal Highway Administration, the Association of American Railroads, the American Public Transportation Association, the American Association of Port Authorities, the Airport Operators Council,associations for oil and gas pipelines,and other relevant transportation professional and research organizations should develop a mechanism to encourage shar- ing of best practices for addressing the potential impacts of climate change. This effort should build on technology transfer mechanisms that already exist,such as AASHTO’s technology-sharing program.Technology should be defined broadly to include probabilistic decision-making tools,as well as monitoring technologies, new materials, and operating and mainte- nance strategies.Summing Up 201 Design Changes Finding: Reevaluating, developing, and regularly updating design standards for transportation infrastructure to address the impacts ofclimate change will require a broad-based research and testing program and a substantial implementation effort. Operational responses are geared to addressing near-term impacts of climate change,but rehabilitating or retrofitting transportation facilities— many of which are designed to have long service lives—requires that transportation planners and engineers consider how climate changes will affect the performance of these facilities 50 or more years into the future.Opportunities for adaptation are limited once a facility has been renovated unless engineers build in the potential to make subsequent changes.Addressing climate change will also require reevaluation,develop- ment,and regular updating of design standards that guide infrastructure design. Environmental factors are integral to the design of transportation infrastructure.Conditions such as temperature,freeze–thaw cycles,and duration and intensity ofprecipitation determine subsurface and founda- tion designs, the choice of materials, and drainage capacity. Engineers, however, have given little thought to whether current design standards are adequate to accommodate climate change.For example,will drainage capacity be adequate for expected increases in intense precipitation events? Many infrastructure components are currently designed for the 100-year storm, but projections indicate that today’s 100-year precipita- tion event is likely to occur every 50 or perhaps even every 20 years by the end of this century.What new materials and operating practices might be needed when very hot temperatures and heat waves become more fre- quent? Are infrastructure components sufficiently strong to withstand the forces of larger and more frequent storm surges and more powerful wave action, the effects of which were vividly demonstrated when Hurricane Katrina simply lifted bridge decks off their supporting structures? Developing standards is a time-consuming consensus process that typically involves professional organizations in an extensive research and testing program.Changes in design practices tend to be incremental,and building to higher standards to strengthen transportation infrastructure so it can accommodate the adverse impacts of climate change must be weighed against the costs involved.202 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Recommendation 9: USDOT should take a leadership role, along with those professional organizations in the forefront of civil engineering practice across all modes, to initiate immediately a federally funded, multiagency research pro- gram for ongoing reevaluation of existing and development of new design standards as progress is made in understand- ing future climate conditions and the options available for addressing them. A research plan and cost proposal should be developed for submission to Congress for authorization and funding ofthis program. Developing standards to address climate change in a timely manner requires leadership by the scientific community and professional associ- ations and, given the scope of the potential impacts, a broadly based, federally sponsored research program.The initial focus ofsuch a program should be on essential links in transportation networks,particularly those vulnerable to climate changes in coastal areas or in low-lying areas in riverside locations. A good model is the congressionally mandated National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program, begun in 1977, which established a research effort and a coordination mechanism to reduce the risks to life and property from earthquakes through the development of standards that afford different levels of protection for different levels of risk.If a similar program is to be launched to address climate change in a timely manner,it should be initiated soon. Recommendation 10: In the short term, state and federally funded transportation infrastructure rehabilitation projects in highly vulnerable locations should be rebuilt to higher standards,and greater attention should be paid to the provi- sion of redundant power and communications systems to ensure rapid restoration of transportation services in the event offailure. Following Hurricane Katrina, for example, the Federal Highway Administration recognized that current design standards for coastal high- way bridges—which were based on a riverine environment and a 50-year storm—were inadequate.The agency approved and shared in the cost of rebuilding bridges damaged in the hurricane to a higher design standard, and it recommended the development of bridge design standards moreSumming Up 203 appropriate for a coastal environment,which take into account the com- bined effects of storm surge and wave action and assume a more severe storm event (e.g.,a 100-year or even a 500-year storm).AASHTO is lead- ing the effort to develop a new consensus standard.Hurricane Katrina also showed the importance of power and communications systems to the restoration of transportation services (e.g.,operation of traffic lights,rail signal systems, pumping stations, air traffic control facilities, and night- time running lights). Finding: Federal agencies have not focused generally on adapta- tion in addressing climate change. The development of appropriate design standards to accommodate cli- mate change is only one ofseveral possible adaptation strategies that may require federal leadership,research,and funding. Recommendation 11: USDOT should take the lead in devel- oping an interagency working group focused on adaptation. This initiative would not necessarily require new funding beyond that recommended above.Better collaboration among federal agencies could help focus attention on adaptation issues and shape existing research programs. Transportation Planning and Land Use Controls Finding: Transportation planners are not currently required to consider climate change impacts and their effects on infrastruc- ture investments,particularly in vulnerable locations. One of the most effective strategies for reducing the risks of climate change is to avoid placing people and infrastructure in vulnerable loca- tions. Transportation planners currently consider expected land use patterns when forecasting future travel demand and infrastructure needs. However, they rarely question whether such development is desirable, much less what effects climate change might have on the provision and development of infrastructure in vulnerable locations.In part,this situa- tion stems from governance arrangements. States, regional authorities, and the private sector are responsible for large-scale transportation204 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation investment decisions,but local governments and a few states control land use decisions through comprehensive plans, zoning ordinances, permit- ting,and building codes.In some locations,transportation and land use planning are becoming more integrated as a result of smart growth poli- cies,which recognize the impact oftransportation investments on regional development and economic growth and vice versa;however,such integra- tion is uncommon. Recommendation 12: Federal planning regulations should require that climate change be included as a factor in the development of public-sector, long-range transportation plans; eliminate any perception that such plans should be limited to 20 to 30 years; and require collaboration in plan development with agencies responsible for land use, envi- ronmental protection,and natural resource management to foster more integrated transportation–land use decision making. Current surface transportation legislation encourages such collaboration. During reauthorization,requiring transportation planners to both consider climate change and collaborate with land use planners in the preparation of public-sector, long-range plans could go a long way toward making these issues more visible.Some metropolitan planning organizations are already using scenario-based approaches to illustrate the trade-offs among social, economic,and environmental goals and understand the impacts of differ- ent long-range investment plans. Scenario planning could be adapted to take potential climate changes into account, and the results could provide the basis for discussion with local governments and developers responsible for land use decisions,particularly in vulnerable areas. Finding: Locally controlled land use planning, which is typical throughout the country, has too limited a perspective to account for the broadly shared risks of climate change. Any strategy that involves land use controls to address climate change would need to build consensus among key decision makers in transporta- tion and land use,probably at the regional level—a challenging proposition. Federal and state incentives may be needed to encourage new organiza- tional arrangements,a topic discussed later in this chapter.Summing Up 205 Insurance Finding: The National Flood Insurance Program and the flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) that determine program eligibility do not take climate change into account. The federal government is the insurer of last resort for homeowners and businesses that cannot secure affordable private flood insurance in specially designated flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program, authorized by Congress in 1968 to mitigate increasing taxpayer-funded flood relief, is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).FEMA maps the nation’s floodplains,and eligible home- owners and businesses receive below-cost insurance. In return, the local community must adopt and enforce floodplain management measures, including building code ordinances for new construction and rebuilding after a disaster, to reduce flood damage. In practice, critics contend that the program has resulted in more development than would otherwise have occurred in these areas. Moreover, the accuracy of the FIRMs used to determine program eligibility is woefully inadequate, despite a map- ping modernization program.Flood hazard area boundaries are keyed to the 100-year storm,and base elevation data are inadequate.The maps are based on historical data and thus do not factor in such climate changes as sea level rise and storm surge. Recommendation 13:FEMA should reevaluate the risk reduc- tion effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program and the FIRMs,particularly in view of projected increases in intense precipitation and storms. At a minimum, updated flood zone maps that account for sea level rise (incorporating land subsidence) should be a priority in coastal areas. Climate change may trigger more intense storms, and sea level rise will extend the scope of flood damage in some special flood hazard areas. FEMA and congressional oversight committees should reevaluate the risk reduction effectiveness ofthe National Flood Insurance Program in light of these projected changes. The FIRMs should account for climate change and the likelihood that it will extend the boundaries ofsome special flood hazard areas, which are keyed to the 100-year storm. These changes are particularly important to transportation engineers because the FIRMs have206 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation become a quasi–design standard,for example,for determining appropriate drainage capacity for transportation infrastructure in coastal areas. New Organizational Arrangements Finding: Current institutional arrangements for transportation planning and operations were not organized to address climate change and may not be adequate for the purpose. The impacts of climate change do not follow modal,corporate,or juris- dictional boundaries,yet decision making in the transportation sector is structured around these boundaries. Transportation planning is con- ducted primarily at the regional level,often through a bottom-up process that starts with local jurisdictions. Railroads, trucking, and waterborne commerce are largely private enterprises with varying levels of federal participation. Thus, existing institutional arrangements are not well suited to addressing climate change.Some models ofcross-jurisdictional cooperation exist,such as regional authorities for specific facilities (e.g., the Alameda Corridor); regional and multistate emergency response agreements; and state-mandated regional authorities, such as those responsible for air quality improvement. One could imagine the emer- gence of similar arrangements to address,for example,the impact of sea level rise on coastal real estate and infrastructure in the tristate New York area or other coastal areas, or the effects of drought on shipping along inland waterways, or the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region. However, state or federal incentives may be required to ensure the development ofsuch organizational arrangements at the regional or multistate level. Recommendation 14:Incentives incorporated in federal and state legislation should be considered as a means of address- ing and mitigating the impacts of climate change through regional and multistate efforts. For example,states could use updated FIRMs or their own state maps to identify geographic areas vulnerable to climate change and craft policies for restricting transportation investments and limiting insurance in these locations.Summing Up 207 WHAT ACTIONS AND RESEARCH ARE NEEDED TO PREPARE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE? At the outset of this study, the committee was asked to provide recom- mendations on actions to be taken to prepare for climate change and on needed research.The committee interpreted this charge broadly,particu- larly as it applies to research.Many of its recommendations relate to the development and sharing of information, decision support tools, and new technologies and materials,as well as research more narrowly defined. The committee also attempted to identify who should implement each of its recommendations. Actions to prepare for climate change can be taken almost immediately. The committee recommends that transportation agencies and service providers inventory critical infrastructure in light of climate change pro- jections (Recommendation 1); incorporate climate change into their long-term capital improvement plans, facility designs, maintenance prac- tices, operations, and emergency response plans (Recommendation 2); incorporate more probabilistic investment analyses and design approaches and communicate the results ofthese analyses to policy makers in ways that highlight trade-offs and investment priorities (Recommendation 3); and build on the experience oflocations where transportation is well integrated into emergency response and evacuation plans to prepare for projected weather and climate extremes (Recommendation 6). Other steps depend on federal and state action.Federal planning reg- ulations should require inclusion of climate change in the development of long-range plans and collaboration between transportation and land use agencies (Recommendation 12); state and federally funded trans- portation infrastructure rehabilitation projects in highly vulnerable locations should be rebuilt to higher standards until design standards can be assessed more broadly in light of climate change (Recommendation 10); FEMA should reevaluate the risk reduction effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program and update the FIRMs,both in light of climate change (Recommendation 13); and federal and state legisla- tion should incorporate incentives to encourage the development of regional and multistate efforts to address the impacts of climate change (Recommendation 14). Research needs, broadly defined, include establishing a process for better communication among transportation professionals, climate sci- entists, and other relevant scientific disciplines and a clearinghouse for208 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation transportation-relevant information on climate change (Recommendation 4);developing climate data and decision support tools that incorporate the needs oftransportation decision makers (Recommendation 5);developing and implementing monitoring technologies for major transportation facilities to provide advance warning of pending failures due to severe weather events and climate extremes (Recommendation 7); developing a mechanism for sharing best practices to address potential impacts of climate change (Recommendation 8);initiating a federally funded,multi- agency research program for reevaluation ofexisting and development of new design standards to address the impacts ofclimate change,including a research plan and cost proposal for immediate submission to Congress (Recommendation 9); and creating a federal-level interagency working group focused on adaptation (Recommendation 11). Most of these ini- tiatives would require federal action; others would require action by professional organizations and university researchers.In all cases,leader- ship and continuing commitment would be essential.

It will summarize possible consequences for transportation, such as from sea- level rise,higher mean temperatures with less extreme low temperatures and more hot extremes, and, possibly, more frequent and severe rain events. U.S. transportation options for adapting to impacts will be ana- lyzed, including possible need to alter assumptions about infrastructure design and operations; ability to incorporate uncertainty in long-range decision making;and capability ofinstitutions to plan and act on mitiga- tion and adaptation strategies at the state and regional levels. The study will also provide federal, state, and local transportation officials in the United States with an overview of the scientific consensus regarding climate change—including uncertainty about its nature and extent. Drawing heavily upon analyses already prepared,the study will sum- marize current and projected contributions of transportation to climate change and the potential effects,costs,and benefits ofstrategies to reduce transportation’s impact.This would include strategies,for example,that affect land use patterns,influence mode choice,and involve alternatively fueled or more efficient motor vehicles. The study will identify critical areas ofneeded research.The final report will include findings and recommendations regarding needed research and suggested actions to prepare for the possibility of climate change. 209APPENDIX B Contribution of U.S. Transportation Sector to Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Assessment of Mitigation Strategies T he body of this report describes how climate change is expected to impact the U.S.transportation sector and identifies ways in which this impact might be ameliorated. The committee’s charge also directed it to review what is known about the contribution of transportation to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: Drawing heavily upon analyses already prepared, the study will summarize current and projected contributions oftransportation to climate change and the potential effects,costs,and benefits ofstrate- gies to reduce transportation’s impact.This would include strategies, for example,that affect land use patterns,influence mode choice,and involve alternatively fueled or more efficient motor vehicles. This appendix addresses this aspect of the committee’s charge. HOW THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR INFLUENCES CLIMATE CHANGE Transportation vehicles emit GHGs when fuel undergoes combustion in their engines. The vast majority of these combustion-related emissions consist of carbon dioxide (CO ).1 But road transport vehicles also emit 2 1The U.S. Energy Information Agency’s annual publication Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United Statesprovides estimates of transport sector emissions of CO, CH, and NO. In 2003, 2 4 2 CO accounted for 97 percent of the total, when each gas is converted into its global warming 2 210Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 211 small amounts ofnitrous oxide (N O) and methane (CH ).Aircraft oper- 2 4 ating at high altitudes emit not only nitrogen oxides (NO ) [which x increases the rate of ozone production by speeding the oxidation of car- bon monoxide (CO) and CH ] but also water vapor [which generates 4 contrails that, depending on the time of day they are produced, either reflect solar radiation back into space (daytime) or trap it (nighttime)] (IPCC 1999;see also Stuber et al.2006). Transport activity is also associated with two additional categories of emissions:(a) those produced in the extraction,production,and distribu- tion of transport fuels and (b) those produced in the manufacture, distribution,and disposal of transport vehicles.2A rough idea of the rela- tive significance ofthese additional categories ofemissions can be obtained from life-cycle studies that attempt to track all emissions related to a vehi- cle and its fuel.One of the best known of these studies estimates that the life-cycle CO emissions generated by a 1996-vintage midsize U.S.passen- 2 ger car using gasoline as its fuel total 263 g/km, of which the vehicle manufacturing cycle (including disposal) accounts for 18 g/km (6.8 per- cent);the fuel cycle,49 g/km (18.7 percent);and fuel combustion,196 g/km (74.5 percent) (Weiss et al.2000,5–8).3 In this appendix, the committee attempts to provide as comprehen- sive a picture as possible of transport-related GHG emissions.It was not feasible to include emissions from each life-cycle stage or emissions of each GHG gas;we do,however,take care to identify which emissions are included in the data presented. CURRENT AND PROJECTED TRANSPORT-RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS According to the 2005 edition of the International Energy Agency (IEA) publication CO Emissions from Fuel Combustion, worldwide CO emis- 2 2 potential. Nearly all the remainder was accounted for by NO (U.S. Energy Information 2 Administration 2004, 31, 49, 62). This publication provides no information on aerosols produced by transport activity, but these are believed to be relatively insignificant. 2The second of these categories is of concern only with respect to road vehicles. The number of nonroad vehicles (locomotives, ships, and aircraft) is so small that the GHG emissions related to their manufacture, distribution, and disposal are minimal. 3The report assumes 95 percent recycling of metals and 50 percent recycling of plastics. In the report, the emissions figures are stated in grams of carbon per kilometer. For consistency with the other emissions data in this appendix, the figures have been converted here to grams of CO per kilometer. 2212 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation sions from fuel combustion in 2003 totaled 25.0 billion tonnes (IEA 2005). The transport sector accounted for 5.9 billion tonnes, or 23.6 percent of this total (IEA 2005).4 Another IEA publication (IEA 2006) provides “ref- erence case”projections of emissions for 2050.According to that report, total CO emissions from fuel consumption in 2050 will be 57.6 billion 2 tonnes (IEA 2006).Transport sector emissions will be 11.7 billion tonnes, or 20.3 percent of this total. The two IEA publications just cited do not provide a high level of modal detail. However, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s Sustainable Mobility Project (SMP) has published detailed modal estimates of emissions from fuel combustion for 2000 and projec- tions at 5-year intervals to 2050 (World Business Council for Sustainable Development 2004).5 The SMP also published estimates and projections of CO ,N O,and CH emissions from the production and distribution of 2 2 4 transport fuels. The SMP’s figures were generated by a model that was benchmarked to the IEA transport sector totals.Table B-1 shows the esti- mates and projections generated by this model. Light-duty passenger vehicles (LDVs), consisting of passenger cars, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and minivans, account for the largest share of transport-related emissions.This will continue to be the case even in 2050 ifpresent trends continue.However,emissions from other modes, notably air transport and trucks used to haul freight, are extremely significant and are projected to grow faster than emissions from LDVs. The SMP report also provides estimates and projections of transport- related emissions by country/region. These are shown in Figure B-1. The United States is included in the region “OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] North America”along with Canada and Mexico. One notable feature of Figure B-1 is the differences in relative growth rates of emissions within different countries/regions.Generally speaking, 4These are emissions from fuel combustion. 5The documentation for this model, as well as the model itself, can be found at www. sustainablemobility.org. The SMP characterizes its projections as what might occur “if present trends continue.” For a description of what is meant by the phrase “if present trends continue,” see Box 2.1 in the SMP report (p. 27). The report also can be found at the web address just cited. The report draws on 2003 data, the most recent available at the time the report was published. This appendix, which draws heavily on the SMP report, uses 2003 data because it would have been impractical to update the data contained in the SMP report.Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 213 TABLE B-1 World Transport Well-to-Wheels (Vehicle +Upstream) CO -Equivalent Emissions by Mode (megatonnes) 2 Year AAGR (%) Mode 2000 2025 2050 2000–2025 2025–2050 Freight +passenger rail 207 341 503 2.0 1.6 Bus 396 436 480 0.4 0.4 Air 733 1,487 2,583 2.9 2.2 Freight truck 1,446 2,423 3,582 2.1 1.6 Light-duty passenger vehicle 2,798 4,152 5,901 1.6 1.4 Two- and three-wheeler 110 209 313 2.6 1.6 Water 638 826 1,015 1.0 0.8 Total 6,328 9,874 14,378 1.8 1.5 Note:AAGR =annual average growth rate.

(Source: Data generated by IEA/SMP Spreadsheet Model.)214 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation emissions from countries not presently members of the OECD are pro- jected to grow much more rapidly than emissions from countries that are members of the three OECD regions. The factors responsible for this faster growth are discussed in more detail below. IEA estimates that U.S.transport-sector emissions from fuel combus- tion in 2003 totaled 1.8 billion tonnes, of which road transport (LDVs, motorized two- and three-wheelers, buses, medium- and heavy-duty trucks) accounted for 85 percent. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides estimates having a greater level of modal detail (see Table B-2).Comparison ofthe figures from Table B-2 with those from Table B-1 implies that in 2003,U.S.transport emissions of CO from fuel 2 combustion accounted for 30 to 31 percent of total world transport CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion,depending on whether international avi- ation and marine bunkers are included.6The emissions factors developed by the SMP for the production and distribution of each type of transport fuel suggest that including fuel cycle emissions would add another 17.5 percent to the U.S.total (and 15.0 percent to the world total). EPA does not publish projections offuture emissions at a similar level of detail. And, as already noted, the SMP’s projections are for OECD North America (i.e., the United States, Canada, and Mexico).According to the SMP data in Figure B-1,OECD North American transport-related emissions will have fallen from 37 percent of the world transport-related total to 26 percent by 2050.This decline in share is accounted for not by any absolute reduction in North American emissions but by the much more rapid rate of growth projected for emissions in regions (other than the other two OECD regions) outside North America. STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING TRANSPORT-RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS The charge to the committee quoted above recognizes that a range of possible approaches exist by which transport-related GHG emissions 6“International aviation and marine bunkers” denotes fuel loaded on transport vehicles in the United States but consumed in international operations. Generally speaking, “international bunkers” are not included in national totals, though they are included in the world totals cited above. The IEA estimates that in 2003, the combustion of international aviation bunkers accounted for 359 million tonnes of CO emissions. The combustion of international marine 2 bunkers is estimated to have accounted for 459 million tonnes of CO emissions. 2).qE OC gT( 3002 ,rotceS esU-dnE noitatropsnarT ni noitsubmoC leuF lissoF morf snoissimE OC .S.U 2-B ELBAT 2 2 epyT leuF edoM etallitsiD aerahS larutaN laudiseR noitaivA liO leuF )%( alatoT edoM yticirtcelE GPL saG liO leuF enilosaG leuF teJ )leseiD( enilosaG epyT elciheV 9.87 1.464,1 selcihev daoR 2.43 6.336 0.0 4.3 2.036 selibomotuA 8.52 8.874 3.0 0.0 6.71 9.064 skcurt ytud-thgiL 4.81 2.143 5.0 1.103 6.93 skcurt rehtO 5.0 9.8 0.0 6.0 0.8 3.0 sesuB 1.0 6.1 6.1 selcycrotoM 3.2 8.24 2.3 6.93 liaR 4.4 1.28 enrobretaW 5.2 5.64 5.92 0.71 staob dna spihS 3.1 6.42 6.81 0.6 )sreknub( spihS 6.0 0.11 0.11 )lanoitaercer( staoB 4.21 8.032 tfarcriA 6.6 8.221 8.221 tfarcria laicremmoC 1.1 5.02 5.02 tfarcria yratiliM 6.0 6.11 2.2 4.9 noitaiva lareneG 9.0 3.61 3.61 tfarcria rehtO 2.3 6.95 6.95 )sreknub( tfarcriA 9.1 8.43 8.43 enilepiP 0.001 6.458,1 2.3 8.0 4.53 1.84 2.2 6.822 7.963 6.661,1 alatot leuF 2.0 0.0 9.1 6.2 1.0 3.21 9.91 9.26 )%(aerahs leuF .sag muelortep deifeuqil= GPL .gnidnuor tnednepedni fo esuaceb mus ton yam slatoT:etoN .sreknub lanoitanretni enrobretaw dna tfarcria sedulcnIa .7-3 elbaT ,5002 APESU:ecruoS216 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation might be reduced. The committee believes that the best way of organiz- ing the present discussion of this range of approaches is through the use of the “ASIF decomposition.”The CO emissions from fuel combustion 2 by transport vehicles can be characterized by the following equation: G =A∗S∗I∗F i i i,j where G=CO emissions from fuel combustion by transport; 2 A=total transport activity; S =modal structure of transport activity; i I =energy consumption (fuel intensity) ofeach transport mode;and i F =GHG emissions characteristics of each transport fuel (i = trans- i,j port mode,j = fuel type). The product of the first two variables on the right-hand side of this equation, A and S, is the demand for transport services provided by i transport mode i. The product of the last two variables, I and F , is the i i,j GHG generated by each unit of transportation service provided by mode i using fuel type j.7 Historically, the primary driver of transport-related GHG emissions has been the growth oftotal transport activity (A).The primary offsetting factor has been a reduction in the energy required to produce each unit of transport services (I). However, improvements in transport energy effi- ciency have been overwhelmed by the increase in transport activity. Changes in the modal structure of transport activity (S) have tended to boost GHG emissions in two ways.First,activity has tended to shift from less energy-intensive transport modes (e.g.,rail) to more energy-intensive modes (e.g., truck). Second, in some modes (e.g., LDVs), the load factor (the percentage of vehicle capacity actually utilized) has fallen sharply.8 Changes in the emissions characteristics of transport fuels (F) have had little impact one way or another. 7This formulation was originally popularized by Lee Schipper. This particular version is taken from IEA (see IEA 2000, 22). 8In both trucking and air transport, improvements in average load factors have tended to offset some of the impact of the inherently higher energy intensiveness of the mode. The energy intensiveness of the modes (I) has increased somewhat as a result. (It takes more energy to move heavier average loads.) But the increase in energy required is considerably less than proportional to the increase in load.Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 217 80.0 70.0 60.0 50.0 40.0 30.0 20.0 10.0 0.0 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 Year Reducing the Volume of Transport Activity (A) or Altering the Modal Structure of Transport Activity (S) The SMP report projects that worldwide personal transport activity,which totaled 32.3 trillion passenger-kilometers (pkm) in 2000, will grow to 74.0 trillion pkm by 20509 (see Figure B-2). Worldwide goods transport activity (excluding waterborne),10 which in 2000 totaled 14.4 trillion tonne-kilometers (tkm),11is projected to grow to 45.9 tkm (see Figure B-3). These projections imply average annual rates of growth of 1.7 percent for personal transport activity and 2.3 percent for goods transport activity (again excluding waterborne).

According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD 2005), in 2000, world seaborne trade totaled 23.7 trillion tonne-miles, or 43.9 tonne-kilometers (tkm). Of this total, 41 percent was oil and oil products, 29 percent was the five main dry bulk commodities (including iron ore, coal, and grain), and 30 percent was other dry cargoes (including containerized cargoes). We assume that the “miles” reported by UNCTAD (2005) are nautical miles. If so, this means that in 2000, ocean shipping accounted for 75 percent of all tkm of freight carried. 11Tonne-kilometer is defined as the transportation of 1 metric ton (tonne) of freight a distance of 1 kilometer.218 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 50.0 45.0 40.0 35.0 30.0 25.0 20.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 0.0 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 Year regions, reflecting basic economic and demographic changes discussed below. At present, the majority of both personal and goods transport activity occurs within or between countries that are members of the OECD.12 Over the next half-century, however, transport activity is pro- jected to grow much more rapidly in those countries that are not presently OECD members.These higher growth rates,if achieved,imply that non- OECD personal transport activity will exceed OECD personal transport activity by about 2025.The crossover point for goods transport activity is likely to be even sooner—perhaps as early as 2015.

Level and Rate of Growth of Real per Capita Income Transportation activity both drives and is driven by the level and rate ofgrowth ofreal per capita income.This should not be surprising.Transportation services are a major enabler ofeconomic growth,and as people become wealthier,they find more reasons to travel.Figure B-4 shows the relationship between real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and per capita personal travel in 2000 for the countries/regions included in the SMP report.13 In 2000,the average resident of an OECD country traveled 5.7 times as many kilo- meters per year as did the average resident of a non-OECD country—a slightly lower ratio than that between the average real per capita incomes of the two country groupings. 13Similar data for goods transport activity are not provided because the information on waterborne origin–destination pairs needed to assign that important transport activity to countries/regions is lacking. )mk fo sdnasuoht( ytivitcA levarT lanosreP atipaC reP FIGURE B-4 Per capita personal travel activity versus per capita real income.

Given the relationship between real per capita income growth and per capita personal (and probably also goods) transport activity,it is obvious that ifthe former were slower,so would be the latter.However,most peo- ple (especially those living in countries where real per capita GDP is relatively low today but is projected to grow rapidly) would find highly unpalatable a strategy of deliberately slowing growth in real GDP per capita in order to slow the growth of travel activity.This does not mean that the link between real per capita income growth and per capita travel activity is immutable.But it does mean that if this link is to be weakened, dnameD tropsnarT lanosreP atipaC rep ni egnahC detcejorP FIGURE B-5 Projected change in real per capita personal transport demand versus projected change in real gross domestic product per capita (purchasing power parity basis), 2000–2050.

Rate of Population Growth The projected trends in real per capita income growth, if realized, will be a powerful force serving to increase transport activity. However, another factor that has exerted a powerful influence in increasing transport activity in the recent past—population growth—will be waning in importance in the future. Population growth rates are falling everywhere.This should not be sur- prising.Figure B-6 illustrates how extraordinary population growth during the last halfofthe 20th century truly was.This explosion ofworld popula- tion was caused by reduced mortality in the less developed regions—a reduction that was not accompanied (at least initially) by declining fertil- ity rates in these regions. One major factor enabling this rapid growth in population was the increased ability to transport food, especially by ship and rail. The growth in population, together with improved transport, stimulated the demand for finished goods.

Reprinted with permission of the United Nations Population Division.)222 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 20th century,the rate ofpopulation growth began to fall,largely because of declines in fertility. As with real per capita income growth, the pattern of population growth over the period 2000–2050 will differ by region. As a result ofsharp fertility declines,the average age ofthe population in many countries will be rising. In 1950, the median age of the world’s population was 23.5 years. It is estimated to have increased to 28.1 years by 2005,and by 2050 is projected to reach 37.8 years.14 Share of Population Residing in Urban Areas Most personal travel is within or between urban areas.Urban areas depend on transport systems to supply them with food,energy,raw materials,and finished goods.It is not surprising,therefore,to find a link between urbanization and trans- port activity. In 1950,about half of the people in the more developed regions lived in cities15 (see Table B-3). By 2000 this figure had increased to nearly 75 percent.16However,the growth in urbanization is tapering offin the coun- tries of the more developed regions.In the next 30 years,the percentage of people living in urban areas in these countries will increase only to 82 per- cent. The total urban population in these regions will experience a relatively small increase, with most of that increase occurring in North America (the United States and Canada).17In contrast,urban populations in countries located in the less developed regions will grow rapidly. Spatial Organization ofUrban Areas (Urban Form) The spatial organi- zation of urban areas exerts an independent influence on the total volume ofpersonal and goods transport activity,as well as on modal choice.When 14The median age of the U.S. population, which was 30.0 years in 1950, is estimated to have reached 36.1 years by 2005 and is projected to grow to 41.1 years by 2050 (UN 2005, Table VIII-12). 15The categorization of countries into those located in “more developed regions” and “less developed regions” is used by the United Nations “for statistical convenience and [does] not necessarily express a judgment about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the developing process” (UN 2005, ii). Generally speaking, countries in the more developed regions are members of the OECD, while those in the less developed regions are not. But there are some important exceptions. Russia and the European portions of the former Soviet Union are included in the more developed regions but are not OECD members. Mexico, South Korea, and Turkey are OECD members but are designated by the United Nations as being in the less developed regions. 16In 2000, 80 percent of the U.S. population lived in metropolitan areas as defined by the U.S. Census. 17The figure for the United States is projected to increase to 87 percent by 2030 (UN 2003, Tables A-3 and A-5).Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 223 TABLE B-3 World Urbanization Trends, 1950–2030 (Projected) More Developed Regions Less Developed Regions Northern Regional Regional Europe Americaa Japan Total China India Total Urban Population (billions) 1950 0.28 0.11 0.03 0.43 0.07 0.06 0.31 1975 0.45 0.18 0.06 0.70 0.16 0.13 0.81 2000 0.53 0.25 0.08 0.88 0.60 0.28 1.97 2030 (projected) 0.55 0.35 0.09 1.01 0.88 0.59 3.93 Change 2000–2030 0.02 0.10 0.01 0.13 0.28 0.31 1.96 Average Annual Rate of Change (%) 1950–1975 1.9 2.0 3.2 2.0 3.4 3.1 3.9 1975–2000 0.7 1.3 1.1 0.9 5.4 3.1 3.6 2000–2030 0.1 1.2 0.2 0.5 1.3 2.5 2.3 (projected) Percentage Urban 1950 51 64 35 53 13 17 18 1975 66 74 57 67 17 21 27 2000 73 79 65 74 36 28 41 2030 (projected) 80 87 73 82 61 41 57 Change 2000–2030 7 8 8 8 25 13 16 aNorthern America =Bermuda, Canada, Greenland, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, and United States.

(Reprinted with permission of the United Nations Population Division.) people talk about eliminating “unnecessary” travel or “unlinking” eco- nomic growth from transport activity, they generally are referring to the deliberate alteration of urban areas’spatial organization to influence the total volume ofpersonal and goods transport activity,the choice ofmodes by which the demand for that activity is fulfilled,and the capacity utiliza- tion rates (i.e.,load factors) of the vehicles being used. How the Spatial Organization of Urban Areas Affects and Is Affected by Transport Activity and Modal Availability Throughout history, the size and shape of cities have been constrained by the ability of their transport systems to supply them with food and raw materials,to enable their res- idents to congregate in numbers sufficient to convert these raw materials224 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation into finished goods efficiently and to conduct other business requiring face-to-face interaction, and to transport their finished goods to distant markets. The development of inexpensive waterborne transportation eased the first and third of these constraints.But cities were still severely limited in size by their ability to move people from their homes to work and back on a daily basis. Until roughly the middle of the 19th century, the area of a city like London was constrained by the distance people could walk from home to work.18 The development of railways linking the suburbs and the central business district (CBD),together with the development ofmeans ofmov- ing masses of people underground within the CBD, enabled Londoners and residents of other major cities to live much greater distances from their work. However, the availability of these modes of high-speed pub- lic transport did not necessarily change the need for people’s activities other than commuting to be located within a relatively short distance of where they lived. Only when automobile availability became widespread did the location constraints on these other activities ease. Indeed, noncommute activities now account for the majority of personal trips and miles traveled in most high-income countries.Table B-4 illustrates this point for the United States with data from the 2001 National Personal Transportation Survey. The spatial organization of urban activity also affects and is affected by goods transport. Before the advent of the automobile and the truck, nearly all large cities had a single, relatively compact CBD where a large share of the city’s employment was concentrated. (In the terminology used by urban planners,these cities were “monocentric.”) The location of the CBD was usually determined by its proximity to waterborne (and later to rail) transportation. The development of the motorized truck freed CBDs from these constraints. Thus, the widespread ownership of motorized road vehicles allowed workers to both live and work almost anywhere they wished within a metropolitan region. The resulting decline in average residential and employment densities has undermined the viability of public transport, 18Indeed, the first traffic count of people entering the 1 square mile City of London between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. (1854) found that horse-drawn omnibuses were the means by which the largest number of people (44,000) were transported into town; 31,000 arrived by train; and 26,000 entered by using private carriages or hackney cabs. But all these modes of transport were dwarfed by the 200,000 who walked.Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 225 TABLE B-4 Characteristics of U.S. “Daily” or “Short Distance” Personal Travel, 2001 Trips Kilometers Annual travel (per capita) 1,481 24,459 Purpose of travel Commuting/business 18% 26% School, church 10% 6% Shopping 19% 13% Family, personal business, escort 25% 20% Social/recreational, vacation, visiting friends, and other 28% 35% Source:CRA International compilation from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey (BTS 2001). especially rail-based public transport. Only cities that have managed to maintain strong CBDs and that developed high-speed public transport systems before the automobile came to dominate personal travel have managed to keep the share of commuting travel by private car relatively low.19 And this is only true for workers traveling to work in the CBD; those with jobs outside the CBD generally commute to work by car. Magnitude of the Impact of the Spatial Organization of Urban Areas on Transport Activity and Modal Choice Studies have demonstrated a statis- tically significant relationship between the spatial organization of urban areas and the volume ofpersonal travel activity.But just how quantitatively significant is this relationship? Two recent U.S.studies provide information on this question. A Transportation Research Board policy study is also under way that is examining the relationships among development pat- terns,vehicle miles traveled (VMT),and the energy conservation benefits of denser development patterns. Ewing et al. (2002) ranked 83 U.S. cities in terms of a “sprawl index” composed of four components:residential density;the neighborhood mix of homes, jobs, and services; the strength of activity centers and down- towns;and the accessibility ofstreet networks.They compiled information on the rate of vehicle ownership,the share of commuters taking transit to work,the share ofcommuters walking to work,the average commute time, 19The share of commuters working in Manhattan who drive to work is just over 10 percent. The data for commuters working in central London are similar.226 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation TABLE B-5 How Personal Transportation Demand Is Influenced by Urban Form Vehicle Miles Sprawl Vehicles Transit to Walk to Commute Traveled per MSA/PMSA Name Index per 100 HH Work (%) Work (%) Time (min) HH (mi/day) Average—10 most 58.86 180 2.1 1.92 26 70.18 sprawling Average—10 least 132.29 162 7.0 3.56 26 54.45 sprawling (excluding outliers) Difference—10 most 73.43 −18 4.9 1.64 0 −15.73 sprawling and 10 least sprawling (excluding outliers) Excluding outliers Jersey City, N.J.

Table B-5 shows the average of these transport indicators and the average sprawl index20 for the 10 “most sprawling” and the 10 “least sprawling” cities.The latter category excludes two clear outliers—New York City and Jersey City21—which are shown separately in Table B-5. The range in the researchers’sprawl index between these two groups of cities—73.43—is almost three standard deviations. Over this range, there is an 11 percent difference in the number of cars per hundred households (180 versus 162) and a 29 percent difference in the number of VMT per household per day (70.18 versus 54.45).For both groups ofcities,the share ofcommuters taking public transit to work averages below 10 percent,and the share of commuters walking to work averages less than 5 percent.The average daily one-way commute time in both groups ofcities is identical— 26 minutes. 20The sprawl index is scaled so that 25 units is equal to one standard deviation. The index ranges in value from 14.22 to 177.78, with a lower value indicating greater sprawl. 21The New York City region (which includes Jersey City) accounts for approximately 40 percent of all U.S. public transport trips.Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 227 The second study,conducted by Bento et al.(2005),covered 114 U.S. urban areas.Instead of developing a sprawl index,these researchers used the actual values of different variables that they believe reflect the spatial organization of these urban areas. They used these characteristics, plus other control variables, to predict the average VMT per household, the average probability ofdriving to work by workers,and the average annual commute miles for the “average U.S. household” if it resided in each urban area. Table B-6 shows these predicted values for six U.S. urban areas:Atlanta,Boston,Chicago,Houston,New York,and San Diego.The difference in predicted average annual VMT per household between Atlanta and Boston (the latter being the “most compact”urban area other than New York City) is 25 percent (16,899 versus 12,704 VMT).The pre- dicted average probability of driving to work by workers does not fall below 70 percent for any city except New York City.The average number of commute miles driven per year ranges between 4,500 and 5,600 miles. The differences in transport activity and modal choice among U.S. urban areas reported in the above two studies are not trivial, but they need to be placed in perspective.Cities change slowly,and their changes are heavily path dependent.Transforming a city with the spatial organi- zation of Atlanta into one with the spatial organization of Boston would be a tremendous task requiring many decades, if it could be accom- plished at all.Making marginal changes over time might be practical,but even this would not be easy. Moreover, marginal changes are likely to yield only marginal results. Impact of Telecommuting and the Internet on Travel Demand Some have argued that the development of telecommuting and the Internet could reduce travel demand significantly.This does not appear to be hap- pening.Mokhtarian (2003) summarizes the evidence as follows: Overall, substitution, complementarity, modification, and neutrality within and across transportation modes are all happening simultane- ously. The net outcome of these partially counteracting effects, if current trends continue,is likely to be faster growth in telecommuni- cations than in travel,resulting in an increasing share of interactions falling to telecommunications,but with continued growth in travel in absolute terms.The empirical evidence to date is quite limited in its ability to assess the extent of true causality between telecommunica- tions and travel, and more research is needed in that area.

My expectations for the future are largely predicated on the assumption that the real price oftravel will continue to decline or at least remain relatively stable. Should the price of travel escalate markedly ... the substitutability of telecommunications will obviously become more attractive.Shifts towards telecommunications substitution may also occur for reasons such as an increasing societal commitment to more environmentally benign or sustainable communications modes, but experience suggests that such impacts will be modest at best.(p.54) Personal and Goods Transport Demand:Summary Growth in personal and goods transport demand is the most important single factor driving the increase in transport-related GHG emissions.This growth is being propelled by growth in real GDP per capita,by population growth, by urbanization, and by the spatial organization of urban areas (urban form).The latter factor is also causing shifts in modal use (public transport to LDVs for personal transport and rail to truck for goods trans- port) that likewise serve to boost transport-related GHG emissions. The correlation between economic growth and increased transport demand has proved to be very robust,but it is not immutable.Reducing it would be a slow process that would require substantial changes in almost every aspect of people’s lives. This does not mean that efforts to induce change should not be made;it does mean that such efforts would not likely bear immediate fruit. Reducing Vehicle Energy Consumption per Unit of Transport Activity (I) Hundreds (if not thousands) of studies describe and analyze the poten- tial of various technologies to reduce the fuel consumption of transport vehicles. Most of these studies focus on personal vehicles—by far the most numerous road vehicles. The majority of the studies also give the230 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation greatest attention to improvements in power train technologies. No attempt is made here to provide an encyclopedic account of the results presented in this vast body of material.Rather,the discussion is confined to broad categories of technologies. Addressed in turn are technologies with the potential to reduce the fuel consumption of road vehicles,those with the potential to reduce the fuel consumption of nonroad vehicles, factors influencing the extent to which the potential of a technology to reduce transport-related GHG emissions is realized, and the impact of vehicle capacity utilization (load factor) on energy use. Technologies with the Potential to Reduce the Fuel Consumption ofRoad Vehicles22 Road vehicles (automobiles, trucks of all sizes, buses, and powered two- and three-wheelers) account for 76 percent of all transport energy use worldwide and for 82 percent of U.S. transport energy use. LDVs (cars, light trucks,and powered two- and three-wheelers) account for the lion’s share of this total—46 percent worldwide and 62 percent for the United States.Most of the remainder—24 percent worldwide and 20 percent for the United States—is accounted for by medium and heavy freight trucks. Engine Technologies Road vehicles utilize one of two fundamental engine technologies—spark ignition or compression ignition.Other tech- nologies, such as gas turbines, have been tried, but have proved unsatisfactory for powering road vehicles.There are,however,a very lim- ited number of vehicles powered solely by electric batteries. Spark-Ignition Internal Combustion Engines Most spark-ignition engines in use today are fueled by petroleum gasoline,but they also can run on syn- thetic gasoline derived from gas-to-liquid processes,on ethanol (or blends of gasoline and ethanol), on compressed natural gas, on liquefied petro- leum gases,or on hydrogen. In the intake system ofspark-ignition engines,air is mixed with small amounts of fuel.In the past,this process was carried out in the carbure- tor, where the fuel was drawn into the airflow mechanically. To meet more stringent emissions requirements,the carburetor has been replaced in nearly all engines by port-injection systems or direct-injection sys- tems. The latter are particularly effective in reducing fuel consumption 22The material in this section is an edited version of IEA 2006, Chapter 5.Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 231 and CO emissions; this is especially true for several combustion tech- 2 nologies now in development,such as lean-burn technologies.23 Conventional engine architectures use valves activated mechanically by one or more camshafts to control the gas flow into the combustion chamber and the expulsion of the exhaust gases.Variable valve control is an advanced system that allows better management of valve timing and substantially reduces the need for the throttle plates in gasoline engines. Some mechanical systems for valve timing have already been introduced. Other systems, based on electromagnetic or electrohydraulic actuation technologies, are currently being developed. Variable valve control can also enable modular use of the engine,completely obviating the need for some of the cylinders when little engine power is required.This solution diminishes fuel consumption even further and has already been intro- duced in some large cars. Controlled auto ignition (CAI) is another new combustion process being actively explored to improve fuel economy and lower the exhaust emissions of spark-ignition internal combustion engines. CAI engines use a highly diluted mixture of fuel,air,and residual gases that can auto- ignite in a four-stroke engine without preheating of the intake air or an increase in the compression ratio. Technologies that reduce or eliminate pumping losses and throttled operations,combined with turbochargers and technologies that help con- tain knock,can result in significant reductions in engine size,also allowing substantial fuel economy improvements and reductions in CO emissions. 2 Many in the automotive industry believe engine downsizing—including the use of turbochargers—can reduce engine displacement size by up to 30 percent.Downsizing the engine also has a positive effect on the whole vehicle design,reducing vehicle inertia and therefore engine load. Almost all recent-model vehicles equipped with a spark-ignition engine are fully capable with low-level ethanol fuel blends,such as E5 or E10 (5 percent and 10 percent ethanol blends,respectively).To use blends ofmore than 10 percent ethanol,some engine modifications may be nec- essary because of ethanol’s low compatibility with certain materials and elastomer components. Using compatible materials would eliminate 23A lean-burn engine is designed to operate with a very high air-to-fuel ratio under light-load conditions. When little power is required, lower amounts of fuel are injected into the combustion chamber, only in the area around the spark. This reduces the need for throttling and limits NO. x232 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation these problems,and the use ofsuch materials is already common in some countries,such as the United States and Brazil.The cost of making vehi- cles fully compatible with E10 is negligible,and the cost remains very low for full compatibility with E85 (an 85 percent ethanol fuel blend.) If engines were designed exclusively for pure ethanol or ethanol-rich blends, their costs would be roughly the same as today, but their fuel economy (expressed in liters ofgasoline equivalent per 100 km) would be better than that of engines designed for conventional gasoline with the same performance.24 Similar effects would be seen in CO tailpipe emis- 2 sions.These improvements are possible because the high octane number of ethanol-rich blends,along with the cooling effect from ethanol’s high latent heat of vaporization, would allow higher compression ratios in engines designed for ethanol-rich blends,especially those using the most advanced injection systems available, such as direct-injection systems. Technologies such as direct injection and turbochargers that could lead to downsizing of spark-ignition engines also favor the introduction of ethanol as a transportation fuel. Compression-Ignition Engines Compression-ignition engines (commonly known as diesel engines) are similar to four-stroke spark-ignition engines, with a few essential differences.One difference is that they do not need to be controlled by a throttle.Instead,the power output is controlled by the amount of fuel injected into the cylinder,without airflow limitation.This characteristic reduces the pumping losses that occur in the aspiration phase in spark-ignition engines.Diesel engines do not need spark plugs.The air- fuel mixture used in these engines self-ignites when the fuel is injected into the combustion chamber.As a result,diesel engines can run lean and reach much higher compression ratios than conventional spark-ignition engines. Diesel indirect-injection engines (the conventional injection technol- ogy used in compression-ignition engines until a few years ago) were characterized by fuel delivery in a prechamber designed to ensure proper mixing of the atomized fuel with the compression-heated air. Precise control of fuel delivery was not easy to achieve in these systems.In recent years,indirect-injection systems have been replaced by common-rail sys- 24According to the Transportation Energy Data Book,25th edition (Davis and Diegel 2006, B-3), the combustion of a gallon of ethanol produces only about two-thirds the heat of a gallon of gasoline (75,670 Btu versus 115,600 Btu). This means a gallon of “gasoline equivalent” ethanol consists of about 1.5 gallons of actual ethanol.Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 233 tems.These systems still use a pump to store fuel at very high pressure in a reservoir (the common rail), which is connected to the combustion chamber by fuel injectors.Rail systems permit the activation of the injec- tors rather than the pump, eliminating the buildup of pressure before each individual injection.This makes it possible to control very precisely the amount of fuel injected and the timing of each injection, thereby maximizing performance and optimizing fuel use. The fact that diesel engines can work with higher compression ratios than gasoline engines and without a throttle favors the use of intake-air compressors,usually in the form of turbochargers.Such compressors are generally coupled with intercoolers and aftercoolers to increase the den- sity of the air entering the combustion chamber. Turbocharged diesel engines,working with common rail and direct injection,are now an estab- lished technology. They equip most of the light-duty diesel vehicles sold in Europe and virtually all new heavy-duty trucks sold around the world.25 Two important barriers to the increased use of diesel engines have been their relatively high emissions of particulate matter and NO . A x modern exhaust system for diesel engines includes a two-way oxidation catalyst and,in the most recent versions,a particulate filter.26The two-way oxidation catalyst is similar to the catalytic converter used in gasoline- fueled cars. It converts unburned hydrocarbons and CO into CO and 2 water.These converters are not as effective as those used in gasoline-fueled vehicles. On the other hand, CO and hydrocarbon emissions from com- pression-ignition engines are inherently low because of the leaner fuel mixture.Oxidation catalysts reduce particulate mass by as much as 50 per- cent. The problem of ultrafine particulates, one of the most dangerous emissions in terms of health effects,remains unresolved at this point. The aftertreatment of NO emissions in diesel engines presents a diffi- x cult technical challenge because of the oxygen-rich state of the exhaust under lean conditions. The formation of NO can be reduced by using x cooled intake-air compression (whereby an intercooler and aftercooler lower the temperature ofthe air-to-fuel mix in the cylinder) and by exhaust 25Variable valve control, already described for gasoline engines, also offers improvements in diesel engines, although its ability to reduce fuel consumption is lower for compression-ignition engines than for spark-ignition engines because the latter suffer from higher pumping losses. 26A diesel particulate filter may take the form of a ceramic honeycomb monolith. It may also consist of sintered metal, foamed metal structures, fiber mats, or other materials. It removes particulate from the diesel exhaust by physical filtration, capturing the particulate matter on its walls.234 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation gas recirculation.Research in the field ofaftertreatment systems continues, including efforts to integrate NO reduction with particulate filters. x Hybrid Vehicles The term “hybrid”refers to any vehicle that can use dif- ferent energy sources in combination. Currently, the term usually refers to hybrid-electric vehicles,27which are powered by a drivetrain that com- bines a conventional internal combustion engine (powered by gasoline, diesel,or an alternative fuel) and an electric motor.Hybrid-electric vehi- cles can be built in a range of engine architectures with varying sizes for the combustion engine and electric motor,each of which involves differ- ent trade-offs in terms of cost,efficiency,and performance. In series hybrids, an electric motor drives the wheels and derives its energy from a battery or an engine, generally an internal-combustion engine,used as a power generator.28The power generator supplies the aver- age power required to operate the vehicle and accessories,while a battery stores the excess energy and provides it when needed.Like electric vehicles, series hybrids may use regenerative braking to recharge the battery.A fur- ther efficiency gain is achieved by the fact that the engine is largely uncoupled from the load because ofroad conditions and can be kept work- ing at a range of operating points where its efficiency is high.This type of engine use offers advantages for the aftertreatment of exhaust gases. In parallel hybrids,motion is delivered to the wheels by both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor.The internal combustion engine is no longer used exclusively as a power plant, but works jointly with the electric motor to deliver movement to the vehicle.“Mild”parallel hybrids have an electric motor that acts as a starter and can serve as an alternator during braking (regenerative braking),while an internal combustion engine powers the drivetrain.In mild hybrid configurations,the electric motor may also provide extra torque and extra power when needed.The electric motor used in mild hybrids is usually located between the engine and the trans- mission or,in “light”designs,in the same position as a standard alternator. Full hybrids can operate in internal-combustion mode, in hybrid mode,or even in all-electric mode,the latter being used mainly for cold starts and for urban driving at ranges below 50 km.The electric energy is stored in large batteries during the periods ofinternal combustion engine 27There are hybrid vehicles that use hydraulic fluid rather than batteries as a power “accumulator.” 28Diesel-electric railroad locomotives are series hybrids. Their diesel engine drives a generator that provides power to electric traction motors.Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 235 driving and regenerative braking. In some cases, electricity is stored by charging the battery from the grid (plug-in hybrids). Hybrid drivetrains are a promising technology not only for LDVs but also for heavy- and medium-duty vehicles that operate locally and for urban buses. Hybrid solutions are not particularly suitable for heavy- duty trucks and intercity buses because the driving cycle ofthose vehicles is characterized by long driving periods at steady speeds. The main barrier to greater market penetration of hybrid vehicles is their cost, which is still higher than that of competing vehicles, notably diesel. In their most advanced configurations, diesel vehicles offer fuel economies not far behind those of hybrids. Reducing the cost, weight, and size of batteries is the greatest technology challenge facing hybrid development. Diesel hybrids achieve smaller reductions in fuel consumption rela- tive to hybrids that incorporate gasoline engines;nevertheless,full diesel hybrids may be the most efficient vehicles in the long run.Diesel hybrid engines will be best suited to urban buses and medium freight trucks, although further improvements in battery technology are needed for this type of application. Table B-7 shows estimates of CO emissions from new midsized U.S. 2 passenger cars equipped with the above engine technologies identified during the three time intervals 2003–2015, 2015–2030, and 2030–2050. On the basis of a 2003–2015 gasoline internal combustion engine vehicle equal to 100,Table B-8 shows an index ofthe emissions from each engine type during each of the three periods. Fuel Cell Vehicles A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water and produces electricity in the process. Fuel cell vehicles are propelled by electric motors, with electricity pro- duced within the vehicle. Proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) fuel cells are particularly suited to powering passenger cars and buses because of their fast start-up time, favorable power density, and high power-to-weight ratio. Fueled with pure hydrogen from storage tanks or onboard reformers, PEM fuel cells use a solid polymer as an electrolyte and porous carbon electrodes with a platinum catalyst.They operate at relatively low temperatures of around 80°C.This has the advantage of allowing the fuel cell to start quickly,but cooling of the cell is required to prevent overheating.The platinum cata- lyst is costly and extremely sensitive to CO poisoning.Research efforts areTABLE B-7 Tailpipe CO Emissions for Midsized U.S. Passenger Cars 2 Using Different Engine Technologies (g/km) Time Period Engine Technology 2003–2015 2015–2030 2030–2050 Spark ignition Gasoline ICEa 130–234 122–219 114–204 Dedicated ethanol ICEb 120–215 112–200 103–185 Flexible fuel vehicle ICEc 133–239 125–224 116–209 Light hybrid, gasoline ICEd 119–214 111–199 103–185 Mild hybrid, gasoline ICEd 108–194 99–178 94–168 Full hybrid, gasoline ICEd 99–178 94–169 89–160 Compression ignition Diesel ICEe 108–193 105–188 102–183 Light hybrid, diesel ICEf 96–173 94–168 91–163 Mild hybrid, diesel ICEf 87–155 83–149 80–143 Full hybrid, diesel ICEf 83–148 80–143 77–138 Note:These estimates refer to a midsized vehicle and assume that roughly half of the potential improvements due to advanced vehicle technologies will improve vehicle fuel economy. (In the case of hybrids, this share rises to 100 percent, but hybrid power trains could also be used to increase performance rather than fuel economy.) The estimates also assume that considerable learning and optimization will occur between 2010 and 2050, in addition to large-scale production of the vehicles.

The current cost of PEM fuel cells exceeds $2,000 per kilowatt (kW), but costs could be cut to as low as $100 per kW through mass production and experience with the technology.This reduction in cost might not be sufficient, however. It is believed that the cost of fuel cells must fall to below $50 per kW to make them competitive.Achieving this cost reduc- tion would require fundamental advances in materials technology and the achievement of higher power densities for fuel cells. Onboard fuel storage is a major challenge. Existing onboard storage options do not yet meet the technical and economic requirements for making them competitive.Safety is also believed to be an issue.Gaseous storage at 350 to 700 bar29and liquid storage at −253°C are commercially 29A bar is a unit of pressure. It is equivalent to 14.5 pounds per square inch (psi). Atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi. So 350 to 700 bar would be approximately equal to 350 to 700 times atmospheric pressure, or 5,000 to 10,000 psi.238 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation available but are very costly. Solid storage (for example, using hydrides) offers potentially decisive advantages but is still under development,with a number of materials being investigated. At present, in the absence of further breakthroughs, gaseous storage at 700 bar appears to be the technology of choice for passenger cars. However,the cost of the tank is $600 to $800 per kilogram (kg) of hydro- gen (H ), and 5 kg of storage capacity is needed to provide adequate 2 range for the vehicle. Depending on the pace of technological development,the stack cost of a PEM fuel cell could decline to $35 to 70 per kW by 2030.If this were to happen,the cost of a fuel cell vehicle at that time would exceed that of a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle by $2,200 to $7,600. Determining CO emissions from hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles 2 is not straightforward.The fuel cells themselves do not produce any CO 2 emissions.However,as discussed below,the processes used to produce the hydrogen fuel can emit large quantities of CO , making the “well-to- 2 wheels” emissions from such vehicles comparable with (and sometimes even higher than) those from conventional gasoline or diesel internal combustion engines. Nonengine Technologies While reductions in engine energy use attract by far the most attention, other important technologies have the poten- tial to reduce the amount of energy required to propel a vehicle. Transmission Technologies Engines have ideal ranges of speed at which they can operate. Operating outside these ranges increases fuel con- sumption and engine wear.A vehicle’s transmission allows its engine to operate more closely to its ideal speed while permitting its driving wheels to operate at the speed the driver chooses. Transmissions use gears to reduce the speed ofthe engine to the speed ofthe wheels.The larger the number ofgears,the more likely it is that the engine will be able to operate at its ideal speed across a wide range of vehicle speeds and power requirements.But more gears mean more com- plexity and more internal friction. Until the 1970s, most LDVs in the United States had three forward gears—low,medium,and high.When fuel prices increased substantially in the late 1970s and early 1980s,vehicles generally added a fourth gear, sometimes called “overdrive.” More recently, transmissions have added electronic controls and additional speeds. Today, transmissions with sixContribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 239 forward speeds are being introduced,and seven-speed transmissions are not unheard of. Some vehicles are now equipped with a continuously variable trans- mission (CVT). CVTs use a system of belts and adjustable-diameter pulleys to permit an infinite number of forward gear ratios. The engine operates at a near-constant speed while the transmission adjusts contin- ually to produce the speed required for the wheels. CVTs have not yet achieved the power-handling capability to be used on the full range of LDV sizes and weights.Also,they have suffered from reliability problems. However,their use has been forecast to increase in the years ahead. Technologies to Reduce Vehicle Weight The lighter a vehicle,the less fuel it consumes.Vehicle mass can be reduced either by decreasing the size of the vehicle or by changing the materials from which it is made. Lighter cars can be propelled by lighter engines. A light power train, in turn, requires less structural support and allows further reductions in the weight of the vehicle frame,suspension,and brakes. Steel is currently the main automotive material.Over the past decade, steel made up an average of 55 percent of the weight of a fully fueled car without cargo or passengers.Most of the remaining weight is accounted for by iron (10 percent), aluminum (6 to 10 percent), and plastics. Cost and the eventual need for large investments to modify the vehicle pro- duction process are the main barriers to the increased use of lightweight materials.High-strength steel can cost as much as 50 percent more than traditional steels, but less of the material is needed to achieve the same performance.30Lighter materials such as aluminum and magnesium cost more than conventional mild steel, but their greater use could lead to improved manufacturing processes, thereby reducing manufacturing costs. Composite materials have extremely attractive properties but cost a great deal more than metals. Another source of weight reduction is the replacement of mechanical or hydraulic systems by electrical or electronic systems. Steering can be accomplished by electric motors actuated by joysticks rather than by mechanical linkages between the steering wheel and the wheels ofthe car. 30The type of steel used in vehicles has been changing. In 1977, 60 percent of the weight of the average U.S. domestic car consisted of steel, 90 percent of which was conventional steel—including cold-rolled and precoated steel. By 2003, the total steel share had fallen to 54 percent, with only 75 percent of that total consisting of conventional steel. During both years, the remainder is accounted for by high-strength steel, stainless steel, and other steels.240 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation This is known as “steering by wire.”“Braking by wire”also has been devel- oped,as has “shifting by wire”and “throttle by wire.” Lightweight technologies are being introduced progressively and will continue to be developed. Tire Technologies The energy requirements of the power train can be reduced through the use of energy-efficient tires. For an LDV, fuel con- sumption can be reduced by 3 to 4 percent through the use of currently available low-rolling-resistance tires.An additional reduction of1 to 2 per- cent in fuel consumption can be achieved by accurately monitoring tire pressure. Currently available technologies can automatically sense low pressure and inform the driver. Technologies to Improve Vehicle Aerodynamics Aerodynamic drag, which is proportional to the square of a vehicle’s speed,is the main factor deter- mining a vehicle’s need for power at high speeds.At this time,aerodynamic issues affect most seriously long-haulage heavy-duty trucks and intercity buses,and significant improvements are possible for such vehicles.At high- way speeds,aerodynamic losses are estimated to account for 21 percent of the energy use of a heavy-duty truck–trailer combination unit. Technologies to Reduce the Energy Requirements of Onboard Equipment The energy consumption ofair conditioners and other onboard appliances can account for up to halfofa vehicle’s fuel consumption under certain con- ditions. A number of efforts are under way to reduce the energy used by these devices.A particular focus has been on reducing the energy required to operate a vehicle’s air conditioning system.Installation rates for air con- ditioners,already approaching 100 percent in both North America and the OECD Pacific region,are growing rapidly in Europe.Fewer than 15 per- cent of LDVs sold in France in 1995 were equipped with air conditioning. By 2000,that rate had risen to 60 percent,and it is expected to reach nearly 100 percent by 2010. A significant barrier to greater market penetration of energy-efficient onboard components is the fact that the energy consumed by these appli- ances is not always captured in current vehicle tests.31 This reduces the incentive for manufacturers to use such devices. The public is largely unaware ofthe fuel use ofonboard appliances and the cost entailed:1 kW- 31We understand that this is not the case for the United States.Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 241 hour (kWh) of electricity generated on board costs just slightly less than 1 liter ofgasoline,exceeding by far the cost ofelectricity generated in cen- tral power plants. Technologies with the Potential to Reduce Fuel Consumption by Nonroad Vehicles While LDVs are,in the aggregate,the largest consumers oftrans- port fuel and emitters of GHGs, vehicles such as medium and heavy trucks, commercial aircraft, locomotives, and large waterborne vessels actually use much more energy per vehicle each year.In 2003,the average U.S.passenger car traveled about 12,000 miles and used about 550 gallons of fuel. The average combination truck (i.e., a tractor unit with one or more trailers) traveled about 62,000 miles and used about 12,000 gallons of fuel.The average commercial aircraft traveled about 900,000 miles and used about 2.3 million gallons offuel.32This appendix has already described technologies applicable to medium and heavy freight trucks and to buses. The discussion now turns to vehicles that do not travel on roads—aircraft, waterborne vessels,and railroad locomotives. Aircraft Commercial aircraft account for 12 percent oftransport energy use worldwide and 8 percent of that in the United States.Since the 1960s, turbine engines fueled by a light petroleum product known as jet fuel have powered virtually all new commercial aircraft. While the combustion process of these turbine engines is quite efficient, the energy required to lift an aircraft and its payload off the ground and propel it long distances at high speeds is formidable. In fact, a large share of the payload trans- ported by any aircraft is its own fuel.Not surprisingly,fuel usage and fuel costs are therefore an extremely important component of the total oper- ating cost of an air transport system,comparable in magnitude with crew costs and ownership and investment costs. In a review of historical and projected future trends in aircraft energy use, Lee et al. (2001) analyze the relative contribution of different tech- nological improvements and operational factors to reducing the energy intensity of commercial aircraft during the period 1971–1998. As mea- sured by megajoules per revenue passenger kilometer,this energy intensity has declined by more than 60 percent—an average decline ofabout 3.3 per- cent a year. 32These data were calculated from data provided in the Transportation Energy Data Book(Davis and Diegel 2006) and National Transportation Statistics 2004(BTS 2005).242 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Three technological factors—reduced specific fuel consumption, an increase in aerodynamic efficiency, and improved structural efficiency— have been responsible for much ofthis decline.Engine efficiency improved by about 40 percent between 1959 and 1995, with most of the improve- ment being achieved before 1970 with the introduction of high-bypass engines.Other factors include higher peak temperatures within the engine, increased pressure ratios, and improved engine component efficiencies. Aerodynamic efficiency has increased by approximately 15 percent histor- ically, driven by better wing design and improved propulsion–airframe integration. Improvements in structural efficiency have contributed less, despite some improvements in the materials used to construct aircraft.As has also been true for motor vehicles, reductions in aircraft weight pro- duced by these improved materials have largely been traded off for other technological improvements and passenger comfort. Lee et al.(2001) project that over the next several decades,the energy intensity of commercial aircraft will continue to decline, but at a slower rate—1.2 to 2.2 percent per year,compared with the 3.3 percent average annual decline experienced over the past several decades. Waterborne Vessels Waterborne transport, including ocean shipping, coastal shipping,and inland waterway transport,accounts for 10 percent of transport energy use worldwide and for 4 percent of U.S.transport energy use.(The U.S.figure includes recreational uses;the world figure does not.) Almost all commercial vessels are powered by diesel engines. The engines used in large oceangoing ships are the largest ever built. These giant diesels can have up to 14 cylinders,each with a bore of980 mm and a stroke of 2,660 mm, giving the engine a displacement of nearly 1,000 liters.Most of these very large engines are classified as “slow speed.”That is, they operate at about 100 revolutions per minute and are coupled directly to the ship’s propeller,eliminating the need for reduction gears. The diesel engines powering towboats or self-propelled barges on inland waterways are much smaller—about the size of a large diesel- electric locomotive, though there may be more than one such engine. Large towboats on U.S.inland waterways are rated at over 10,500 horse- power.Fuels used by waterborne transport vehicles are “heavy”grades of diesel fuel and an even “heavier”petroleum product known as “residual fuel oil.” Typically, these fuels are higher (often much higher) in sulfur relative to other transport fuels.Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 243 TABLE B-9 Marine Emissions, 1996 Gas Component Range of Estimated Emissions (Mt) Carbon monoxide 0.7–1.1 Nonmethane volatile organic compounds — Methane — Nitrous oxide — Carbon dioxide 436–438 Sulfur dioxide, total 5.2–7.8 Generated by combustion of residual fuel oil 5.0–7.0 Generated by combustion of distillate 0.2–0.8 Nitrogen oxides 10.1–11.4 Source:IMO 2000, p. 11.

Table B-10 summarizes the report’s findings con- 2 cerning technical measures that might be applied. Railroad Engines33 Railroad engines account for 3 percent oftransport energy use worldwide and for 2 percent of transport energy use in the United States. Most railroad engines use electricity generated externally or diesel fuel carried on board as their primary energy source. For the world as a whole,27 percent ofenergy used by railroads is externally gen- erated electricity,59 percent is diesel,and 12 percent is coal (virtually all in China). Countries vary widely in the extent to which their railroads rely on electric power. Railroads in Canada and the United States are almost totally diesel powered.In Japan,78 percent of the rail energy used is electrical,and in Europe,61 percent.34 33The International Union of Railways conducted a project, Energy Efficiency Technology for Railways, in which a range of technologies relating to railway energy efficiency including, but not limited to, engine technologies were evaluated. The project can be accessed at www.railway-energy. org/tfee/index.php. 34The statistics in this paragraph were calculated from 2003 data provided by IEA.244 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation TABLE B-10 Marine CO Reductions by Technical Measure 2 Fuel/CO Savings 2 Measure Potential (%) Subtotala(%) Totala(%) New ships 5–30 Optimized hull shape 5–20 5–30 Choice of propeller 5–10 Efficiency optimized 10–12b 14–17b 2–5c 6–10c Fuel (HFO to MDO) 4–5 Plant concepts 4–6 8–11 Fuel (HFO to MDO) 4–5 Machinery monitoring 0.5–1 0.5–1 Existing ships 4–20 Optimal hull maintenance 3–5 4–8 Propeller maintenance 1–3 Fuel injection 1–2 5–7 Fuel (HFO to MDO) 4–5 Efficiency rating 3–5 7–10 Fuel (HFO to MDO) 4–5 Efficiency rating +TC upgrade 5–7 9–12 Fuel (HFO to MDO) 4–5 Note:HFO =heavy fuel oil; MDO =marine diesel oil; TC =turbocharging. aPotential for reduction from individual measures is documented by different sources; potential for combinations of measures is based on estimates only. bState-of-the-art technique in new medium-speed engines running on HFO. cSlow-speed engines when trade-off with NO is acceptable. x Source:IMO 2000, p. 14. (Reprinted with permission of IMO.) Recent years have seen major improvements in the efficiency of elec- tric locomotives, brought about by the use of AC power. In the case of diesel-powered locomotives, propulsion system developments have focused primarily on improving the power, reliability, and efficiency of the diesel engines used to generate onboard electric energy,as well as the efficiency of the electric traction engines that deliver this energy to the driving wheels. In addition, diesel locomotives have become subject to emissions standards and,in some places,to noise standards. Interest is growing in the use offuel cells to provide auxiliary power for diesel locomotives. This would permit the main diesel engine to be shutContribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 245 down when the locomotive is not in use but still has power needs.Idle time constitutes a surprisingly large share of the total time a diesel engine is in operation.A recent study of locomotive duty cycles on Canadian railroads found that engines were idling between 54 and 83 percent of the time. Using either fuel cells as auxiliary power units or the “hybrid” approach described above would permit engines to reduce the amount of idle time substantially. Although fuel use and emissions are much greater when a locomotive is operating at full power than when it is idling, the potential improvements in both are nontrivial. Factors Influencing the Extent to Which the Potential of a Technology to Reduce Transport-Related Greenhouse Gas Emissions Is Realized One of the most controversial issues in the debate over the use of new technologies to reduce GHG emissions is how effective these technologies will be when incorporated into actual transport vehicles in normal serv- ice. Invariably, ex post analyses of actual emissions reductions fall short (sometimes considerably short) of their original claimed potential. The discussion below reviews some of the more important factors that tend to create this result. Extent to Which a Technology’s Potential to Reduce Energy Consumption Is Incorporated into the Vehicles in Which It Is Employed Most vehicle technologies with the potential to reduce fuel consumption offer vehicle designers a range of possibilities for how they may be used.Depending on the decisions made by the designer,the share of this potential that is actu- ally used to reduce fuel consumption can vary from zero to 100 percent. The history of LDV fuel economy in the United States since the mid- 1980s provides a textbook example.The bottom line in Figure B-7 shows the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) of the new light vehicle fleet as tested by EPA. New LDV CAFE rose sharply between 1979 and 1982, increased slowly from 1983 through 1987, declined slowly from 1987 through 1994,and has remained nearly constant since. This does not mean that vehicle technologies related to fuel consump- tion have failed to improve since the mid-1980s. EPA uses a measure known as ton-miles per gallon as an (imperfect) reflection of changes in the energy efficiency potential of the technologies actually incorporated into vehicles.The top line of Figure B-7 tracks this indicator.It has grown relatively steadily at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year throughout the246 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 1975 1978 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005 Model Year period,reflecting the new technologies that have been introduced and dis- seminated throughout the new vehicle fleet. What explains the sharp contrast between the two lines in Figure B-7? The briefanswer is that for much ofthe period,most ofthe fuel economy improvement potential has been used by vehicle designers to improve vehicle performance, not fuel economy. Figures B-8a and B-8b show, respectively, the evolution of passenger car and light truck acceleration performance (measured as 0–60 mph time) between 1975 and 2006. Figures B-9aand B-9bshow similar data for the evolution of vehicle iner- tia weight.35 The sharp decline in inertia weight, rather than any radical change in vehicle technology,largely explains the dramatic improvement in new vehicle fleet fuel economy that occurred between the late 1970s and the early 1980s.

By 2006, the weight of the average LDV had exceeded its 1975 level. The acceleration performance of both fleets of vehicles had improved dramatically. The 2005 edition ofthe EPA report just referenced (Heavenrich 2005) estimates the impact of vehicle weight and vehicle performance on the “laboratory” (or “as tested”) fuel consumption of new U.S. passenger cars, light trucks, and all LDVs. Table B-11, adapted from this report, shows these results. The top line of the table shows the actual “labora- tory” (or “as tested”) “combined” fuel economy (mpg) for new model year 2005 cars, trucks, and the total LDV fleet. The next two rows show estimates of what the 2004 fuel economy would have been had the iner- tia weight and 0–60 acceleration time been what they were in 1981 and 1987. The final two rows show similar results for size (interior volume) and 0–60 acceleration time.In all cases,the model year 2004 fleet would have exhibited improved fuel economy performance,with the increase in some cases being as high as 30 percent.

Whatever the reason, technological improvements have not automatically translated into improved fuel economy over much of the period shown. Length of Time Required Between the First Commercial Use of a Technology and When Its Impact on Fuel Consumption Is Felt Throughout the Entire Vehicle Fleet New technologies are not intro- duced across a manufacturer’s entire fleet at one time.EPA has collected data showing the length of time required to achieve various rates of fleet penetration for successful new LDV technologies in the United States (Heavenrich 2006,62).Fifty percent penetration rates of 10 years are not unusual,and 75 percent penetration rates can easily take 20 years to achieve. Transport vehicles tend to last a long time. Half the cars built during the 1990 model year were still on the road when the 2007 model year vehi- cles were first introduced. Heavy trucks last even longer. On the basis of “minimal preliminary data,”the expected median lifetime for a model year 1990 heavy truck is 29 years (Davis and Diegel 2006,Tables 3-8 and 3-10).Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 251 Commercial aircraft are also very long-lived.DC-3 aircraft built 50 years or more ago are still in commercial service in parts ofthe world.Boeing esti- mates that 8,800 ofthe world’s fleet of17,000 commercial aircraft that were operating in 2005 will still be operating in 2025 (Boeing Company 2006,6). Table B-12 shows estimates made by MIT’s Laboratory for Energy and the Environment as to how long it might take for various new LDV tech- nologies to have a significant impact on energy use and GHG emissions. How Motorists Actually Operate Their Vehicles The way vehicles are operated has a significant influence on fuel consumption. Governments test the fuel consumption performance of LDVs on dynamometers that are programmed to follow a set sequence of actions (accelerating, stop- ping, operating at high speed, operating at low speed, etc.) for specific intervals oftime.Their ratings ofvehicles’fuel consumption are based on these tests.However,vehicle operators typically do not operate their vehi- cles as implied by these test procedures.They accelerate more rapidly,drive faster, and so on. This produces a significant gap between “as tested”and “in-use”fuel consumption.For reporting purposes (but not for regulatory compliance purposes),EPA currently adjusts “as tested”mpg downward by 15 percent to make it more comparable with the fuel economy vehicle users are likely to experience in practice. However, the agency believes that this adjustment factor, which is about two decades old, is outdated and proposes increasing it to approximately 22 percent. According to EPA, adoption of this new adjustment factor would result in the 2006 TABLE B-12 Timescales for New Light-Duty Vehicle Power Train Technologies Implementation Phase (years) Penetration Across Market New Vehicle Major Fleet Total Time Vehicle Technology Competitive Productiona Penetrationb for Impact Turbocharged gasoline engine 5 10 10 20 Low-emissions diesel 5 15 10–15 30 Gasoline hybrid 5 20 10–15 35 Hydrogen fuel cell hybrid 15 25 20 55 aAccounts for more than one-third of new vehicle production. bAccounts for more than one-third of all mileage driven.

Using the current 15 percent adjustment factor, the adjusted fuel econ- omy for the 2006 U.S. new vehicle fleet is 21.0 mpg (11.2 L/100 km) (Heavenrich 2006,A.10–A.14). Impact ofVehicle Capacity Utilization (i.e.,Load Factor) on Energy Use In the analysis thus far, reductions in energy use per vehicle kilometer have been treated as producing corresponding reductions in energy use per passenger kilometer or tonne-kilometer.The latter two measures,not the former, represent the fulfillment of transport demand. Increasing a vehicle’s average load ofpassengers or freight,while increasing energy use somewhat, normally leads to a reduction in the energy required to pro- duce a given volume of transport services.Fitting vehicle size to demand is an important consideration in minimizing transport energy use. Different transport modes have experienced varying degrees ofsuccess in improving the capacity utilization of their vehicles. In the case of U.S. commercial aviation,the increase in average load factor from about 55 per- cent in 1975 to the 80+ percent levels being experienced today is responsible for a major share of the industry’s energy efficiency improve- ment per passenger kilometer.The average load factor offreight trucks has also increased. However, U.S. LDV load factors have shown the opposite trend.Between 1977 and 2001,the average number of occupants per vehi- cle declined from 1.9 to 1.6 passengers,or by 14 percent (Hu and Reuscher 2004,Table 16,p.31).This helps explain why the number ofBtu’s required to propel the average U.S. passenger car 1 mile fell from 9,250 in 1970 to 5,572 in 2003 (i.e., by 40 percent), while the number of Btu’s required to move one passenger 1 mile fell only from 4,868 to 3,549 (i.e.,by 27 percent) over the same period (Davis and Diegel 2006,Table 2-11,p.2–13). The percentage of a vehicle’s available capacity that can be used is the result of a complex trade-off between cost and convenience.No form of commercial transport can operate at 100 percent of capacity all the time. But as operating costs increase,people are willing to sacrifice convenience to reduce cost, and load factors rise. Public transport systems are espe- cially sensitive to this trade-off.As noted above,low residential densities and the decline of CBDs as the location of most jobs have reduced the number of people wishing to travel from one given point to another, especially during peak hours. Maintaining a level of service frequency and service coverage necessary to make public transport services attrac-Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 253 tive has collided with the need to use larger vehicles to reduce per seat labor,energy,and capital costs. Vehicle Fuel Consumption:Summary New technologies have the potential to reduce substantially the energy used by transport vehicles.The time required to develop,commercialize, and disseminate new vehicle technologies probably is shorter than the time required to alter the fundamental drivers of personal and goods transport demand,but it is still measured in decades.In addition,there is the problem of ensuring that the potential of new technologies to reduce energy consumption in transport is actually realized. As the example of U.S.LDVs after the mid-1980s shows,there is no guarantee that this will occur. Fuel consumption is but one of many attributes of vehicle per- formance.Unless conditions are right (or can be made right),it is possible that some (or even all) ofthis potential will end up improving these other performance attributes rather than reducing vehicle fuel consumption. Altering the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Characteristics of Transport Fuel (F) Gaseous and liquid transport fuels can be produced from a wide range of primary energy sources (see Figure B-11). Depending on the feedstock used and the production method employed, CO emissions (sometimes 2 referred to as “well-to-tank”or WTT emissions) can vary widely, some- times even being negative.As noted above,changes in the GHG emissions characteristics of transport fuels have not contributed much one way or the other to changes in transport-related GHG emissions over the past several decades. This is due to the present overwhelming dominance of petroleum-based fuels in transport and to the fact that all petroleum- based transport fuels emit approximately the same amount of CO per 2 unit ofenergy they provide (see Table B-13).In the future,however,WTT emissions are likely to have much greater significance in determining total transport-related GHG emissions. Figure B-12, from the SMP’s final report, shows estimates of the “well-to-tank,”“tank-to-wheels” (TTW, sometimes also called “tailpipe emissions”), and “well-to-wheels” (WTW) emissions (the sum of WTT and TTW emissions) generated by a wide range ofvehicle–fuel combina- tions.The figure illustrates that for transport fuels such as hydrogen and for power train technologies such as fuel cells, the WTT portion totally dominates total transport-related CO emissions. 2254 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation FIGURE B-11 Possible transport fuel pathways (CNG = compressed natural gas; DME = dimethyl ether; FC = fuel cell; FT = Fischer–Tropsch; ICE = internal combustion engine; LPG = liquefied petroleum gas).

(Source:World Business Council for Sustainable Development 2004, adapted from Figure 3.3, p. 77.) The wide range in WTT emissions for the various fuels illustrated in Figure B-12 results largely from three factors: • The growing of biomass used to manufacture biofuels (and possi- bly hydrogen) removes CO from the atmosphere.Gathering and 2 processing the biomass into fuel takes energy and results in the emission of CO .This offsets some of the CO removed from the 2 2256 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation atmosphere by the growing of the biomass.But under plausible assumptions,net WTT CO emissions for biomass-derived fuels 2 can still be negative. • The production process for some biofuels (e.g.,ethanol from corn) generates coproducts that can displace other products that require energy to produce and whose production emits CO .How 2 these “coproduct credits”are allocated has a major impact on a biofuel’s costs,the energy required to produce it,and its WTT CO emissions (Farrell et al.2006). 2 • The production of transport fuels from nonpetroleum fossil car- bon sources (e.g.,coal or natural gas) generates substantial CO 2 emissions.However,if these emissions can be sequestered,the WTT emissions from the production of these fuels can be reduced to nearly zero. Analysts differ on how each these factors should be treated in “scoring” the WTT emissions characteristics of different transport fuels produced by different processes from different primary energy sources. Therefore, anyone reviewing the literature on this topic can expect to encounter a range of estimates.The important thing now universally acknowledged is that WTT emissions must be incorporated into any estimates of future transport-related CO emissions. 2 Fueling Infrastructure A vast supply infrastructure has developed to deliver petroleum-based transport fuels to the vehicles that utilize them. As noted earlier, motor vehicles can use some alternative fuel blends (e.g., E5 and E10) without major modifications either to their engines or to their fuel systems. The same is true of the current fuel supply infrastructure.Today’s petroleum product pipelines routinely carry gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and propane.They also can carry “mild”blends ofgasoline and biofuels (such as E5 and E10).But they cannot carry blends consisting of a majority of biofuels (such as E85) or 100 percent ethanol.The only gaseous transport fuel carried by pipeline is natural gas. Other gaseous transport fuels (in particular,hydrogen) would require dedicated pipelines. Another very important part of the transport fuel infrastructure is the fueling stations that actually deliver fuel to vehicles.Most of these areContribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 257 not directly connected to a pipeline. Instead, they are supplied by tank trucks that haul fuel from a distributing point (that is connected to a pipeline) to individual fueling stations. One of the most formidable challenges facing any new transport fuel would be the establishment of an infrastructure capable of distributing it widely. The enormous fixed costs involved in establishing such an infrastructure mean it would not be established without assurance that the demand for the products it would transport would be forthcoming. Yet the vehicles that would be the source of this demand would not be built and purchased without assurance that fuel to power them would be available. Efforts are being made in some states to establish “hydrogen high- ways.”These are routes along which enough hydrogen refueling stations have been established to permit drivers of hydrogen-fueled vehicles to travel on them. These stations are supplied by tanker trucks. While this could help build initial demand for hydrogen as a transport fuel,it is not a long-term solution to the fuel infrastructure problem. HOW MUCH AND OVER WHAT TIME PERIOD MIGHT TRANSPORT-RELATED GHG EMISSIONS BE REDUCED? This appendix has described a wide range of technological and non- technological means of reducing transport-related GHG emissions. In this final section, the committee attempts to indicate how much transport-related GHG emissions might be reduced given the trends thus far described. As stated at the outset, the fundamental challenge is to reduce the emissions produced per unit of transportation services provided more rapidly than the demand for transportation services grows.While it may be possible to reduce the rate of transportation demand growth some- what without harming economic growth unacceptably,the committee is aware of no forecast that projects that transportation demand will fail to grow relatively rapidly in the decades ahead, especially in many of the world’s less developed countries.The bulk ofthe responsibility for reduc- ing emissions will therefore fall on improved vehicle technologies and low-carbon or carbon-free fuels. There is considerable uncertainty about what it might cost to com- mercialize and widely disseminate many of the more advanced vehicle258 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation technology and fuel solutions. Given what is known about projected demand growth, however, it is possible to simulate what might be feasi- ble trajectories of advances in vehicle technology and fuel substitution. To obtain a better sense of the potential impact of various technolo- gies and fuels in reducing transport-related GHG emissions, the SMP conducted a number of simulations using its spreadsheet model. The benchmark was the SMP reference case projection showing total trans- port-related CO emissions doubling between 2000 and 2050,with most 2 of the growth in emissions occurring in the countries of the developing world. While other analyses have examined this issue for individual developed countries or regions, to the committee’s knowledge, the SMP was the first to examine it for the world as a whole. In these simulations,the focus was on total road transport.The exer- cise did not examine the technical or economic feasibility of any of the actions being simulated. It was intended merely to help the SMP under- stand the impact on GHG emissions from road vehicles if the actions described were taken. This enabled the SMP to compare its results with those of other studies that likewise did not consider technical or economic feasibility in deriving their results. Single-Technology Simulation The SMP began by examining the impact of single technologies on CO 2 emissions from road transport worldwide.Figure B-13 shows results for five such technologies—dieselization, hybridization, fuel cells,“carbon- neutral” hydrogen, and biofuels. It was assumed that each power train technology would achieve as close to 100 percent global sales penetration as possible given the characteristics of the technology and that each fuel would become as close to 100 percent of the global road transport fuel pool as its characteristics would permit. The SMP emphasized that these single-technology examples were purely hypothetical.It is highly unlikely in practice that any single tech- nology would achieve 100 percent penetration.Also,the examples cannot be added together. Differences in the timing of the implementation of these technologies and fuels in the developed and developing worlds were largely ignored. For both diesels and advanced hybrids,it was assumed that 100 per- cent sales penetration would be reached by 2030 and that these technologiesContribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 259 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 would be used in LDVs and medium-duty trucks.36In the case offuel cell vehicles, it was assumed that 100 percent sales penetration would be reached by 2050.37 It was also assumed that the hydrogen used in these vehicles would be produced by reforming natural gas and that carbon sequestration would not be involved.The estimate of the impact of car- bon-neutral hydrogen was generated by changing the WTT emissions characteristics ofthe hydrogen used in the fuel cell case just described.To focus on the impact of biofuels,it was assumed that these fuels would be used in a world road vehicle fleet similar in energy use characteristics to the SMP reference fleet. Diesel internal combustion engine technology (using conventional diesel fuel) was assumed to have an 18 percent fuel consumption benefit compared with the prevailing gasoline internal sGHG tnelaviuqE-OC sennotagiG 2 Reference Case Diesels Hybrids Fuel Cells (hydrogen from natural gas) Fuel Cells (zero-carbon hydrogen) Advanced Biofuels (all road vehicles) FIGURE B-13 Hypothetical potential of individual technologies to lower road transport well-to-wheels GHG emissions relative to the SMP reference case. (Source:World Business Council for Sustainable Development 2004, Figure 4.7, p. 113.) 36A very high proportion of heavy trucks and buses are already diesel powered. The SMP assumed that hybrid technology would not see significant use in heavy-duty over-the-road trucks and buses because of their operating characteristics. Public transport buses are already being viewed as prime candidates for hybridization. These were not included in the SMP’s calculation, but their omission makes relatively little difference in the results. 37The SMP made the same assumptions concerning the types of vehicles to which fuel cells might be applied as it did for hybrids.260 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation combustion engine technology during the entire period. The fuel con- sumption benefit relative to gasoline internal combustion engine technology was assumed to be 36 percent for diesel hybrids, 30 percent for gasoline hybrids,and 45 percent for fuel cell vehicles. From this single-technology assessment, it is evident that even if implemented worldwide,diesels and hybrid internal combustion engines fueled with conventional gasoline and diesel fuel or fuel cells fueled with natural gas–derived hydrogen could no more than slow the growth in road transport CO emissions during the period 2000–2050.Only the use 2 of carbon-neutral hydrogen in fuel cells and advanced biofuels in inter- nal combustion engine–powered vehicles could largely or totally offset the increase in CO emissions produced by the growth in road travel dur- 2 ing the period 2000–2050. This does not mean that vehicle energy use characteristics are irrele- vant. They might not have a major impact on the trajectory of road vehicle GHG emissions over the very long term, but they would have a major impact on the amount of low-carbon or carbon-neutral fuel that would have to be produced to power the world’s road vehicle fleet. This means they could have a very important impact on the cost of signifi- cantly reducing GHG emissions from road vehicles.38 On the basis of these results, the SMP concluded that it is only through a combination of fuel and power train solutions that significant CO reduction can be attained. No single-technology pathway merits 2 selection as the sole long-run solution. Combined-Technology Simulation Since the substantial reduction of CO emissions from road vehicles is 2 likely to depend on the widespread adoption of several advanced vehicle and fuel technologies,as well as other factors,the SMP decided to exam- ine the combined impact of several actions,including the following: • Fuels that are carbon neutral (defined by the SMP as ones that reduce WTW CO emissions by at least 80 percent); 2 • Power trains that are highly energy efficient; 38The fuel economy benefit relative to gasoline internal combustion engine technology was assumed to be 36 percent for diesel hybrids, 30 percent for gasoline hybrids, and 45 percent for fuel cell vehicles.Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 261 • A change in the historical mix-shifting trend to larger vehicle cat- egories;and • Improved traffic flow and other changes in transport activity resulting from better integration of transport systems,enabled,at least in part,by information technology. The SMP set an illustrative target ofreducing annual worldwide CO emis- 2 sions from road transport by halfby 2050.This is equivalent to a decline in yearly CO emissions ofabout 5 gigatonnes from levels that the SMP refer- 2 ence case projects would otherwise be reached and,by coincidence,returns annual road vehicle CO emissions in 2050 to about their current levels. 2 For illustrative purposes, the CO reduction target was divided into 2 six increments.The timing and size of each increment are not fixed and ultimately would be decided on the basis ofsustainability and investment choices at the national, regional, and global levels. The purpose of the analysis was to illustrate what might be achieved if ambitious changes were made beyond those in the SMP reference case,with no judgment as to cost or the probability of each step being taken. Increment 1. Dieselization:It was assumed that dieselization ofLDVs and medium-duty trucks would rise to around 45 percent globally by 2030 (that is, to about current European levels). Diesel engines were assumed to consume about 18 percent less fuel (and emit 18 percent less CO ) than current gasoline internal combustion engines. 2 Increment 2. Hybridization: It was assumed that the hybridization (gasoline and diesel) of LDVs and medium-duty trucks would increase to half of all internal combustion engine vehicles sold by 2030.Gasoline hybrids were assumed to consume an average of30 percent less fuel than current gasoline internal combustion engines, and diesel hybrids were assumed to consume an average of24 percent less fuel than current diesels.39 Increment 3. Conventional and advanced biofuels:It was assumed that the quantity of biofuels in the total worldwide gasoline and diesel pool would rise steadily, reaching one-third by 2050. Conventional biofuels (those yielding a 20 percent CO unit efficiency benefit) were capped at 2 39It is generally acknowledged that, because of the diesel’s initial superior energy efficiency, any additional benefit from hybridizing a diesel is likely to be smaller than that from hybridizing a gasoline engine.262 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 5 percent of the total pool.The balance was assumed to be advanced bio- fuels (those yielding at least an 80 percent CO unit efficiency benefit).40 2 Increment 4. Fuel cells using hydrogen derived from fossil fuels (no carbon sequestration): It was assumed that mass market sales of LDVs and medium-duty trucks would start in 2020 and rise to half of all vehi- cle sales by 2050. It also was assumed that fuel cell–equipped vehicles consume an average of45 percent less energy than current gasoline inter- nal combustion engines. Increment 5. Carbon-neutral hydrogen used in fuel cells: It was assumed that hydrogen sourcing for fuel cells would switch to centralized production of carbon-neutral hydrogen over the period 2030–2050 once hydrogen LDV fleets had reached significant penetration at the country level. By 2050, 80 percent of hydrogen would be produced by carbon- neutral processes. The first five increments reflect the inherent properties of different vehicle technologies and fuels.Actual reductions in CO emissions will be 2 determined not only by these properties but also by the mix of vehicles purchased by consumers and businesses and by how these vehicles are used on a daily basis. To reflect these two factors, two more increments were included. Increment 6. Additional improvement in fleet-level vehicle energy efficiency:The SMP reference case projects an average improvement in the energy efficiency of the on-road LDV fleet of about 0.4 percent per year, with new vehicle sales showing an average 0.5 percent per year improve- ment in fuel economy. The improvement potential embodied in actual vehicles is around 1.0 percent per year, but about half of this potential improvement is offset because ofvehicle purchasers’preferences for larger and heavy vehicles. In developing this increment, the SMP assumed that preferences relating to the mix of vehicles chosen by purchasers and the performance of these vehicles would change somewhat, leading to an additional 10 percent average annual in-use improvement relative to the reference case (i.e., average annual fleet-level improvement would rise from about 0.4 percent to about 0.6 percent). 40This implies that these advanced biofuels are either gasoline from lignocellulosic sugar fermentation or diesel from biomass gasification/Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 263 Increment 7. A 10 percent reduction in emissions due to better traf- fic flow and other efficiencies in road vehicle use:It was assumed that the gap between on-road energy-use performance and the technological improvements embodied in vehicles would narrow.How might this hap- pen? For one thing, there are a number of opportunities relating to the increased use of information technology in transport systems that might enable the better management oftravel demand.Improved routing infor- mation might permit trips to be shortened,while improved information about road conditions might reduce the amount of time motorists spend in their vehicles while idling in traffic.For another thing,more accurate and current information about when public transport vehicles will arrive and how long they will take to get to their destinations might encourage additional use of public transport. Individually, none of these improve- ments would be major, and almost certainly there would be offsets. But in combination, the SMP assumes that such factors could produce an additional 10 percent reduction in road vehicle CO emissions. 2 Figure B-14 shows the results of the SMP combined-technologies analysis just described.It confirms the impression conveyed by the three single-technology analyses discussed above that the widespread adoption of a combination of vehicle and fuel technologies (plus other factors) would be required to return 2050 CO emissions from road vehicles to 2 their 2000 level. SUMMARY Any global warming that will be experienced during the next several decades will largely be the result of GHG emissions that have already occurred.As the main body of this report points out,regardless of what else it might do,America’s transport sector will have to adjust to the con- sequences of this warming. But the transport sector in general, and America’s transport sector in particular, is a significant source of GHG emissions.If future warming is to be limited,GHG concentrations in the atmosphere must be stabilized. This will require reducing GHG emis- sions not merely to below what they might otherwise be if present trends were to continue but to well below current levels. The transport sector will have to contribute to this reduction. This appendix has identified several approaches by which transport- related GHG emissions might be reduced. A common characteristic of264 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 these approaches is that they take considerable time to be fully effective. This means that if transport-related GHG emissions are to be reduced to below their current levels by 2050, steps must be taken now to begin to implement certain of these approaches.

        "Special Report 290 Potential Impacts of CLIMATE CHANGE on U.S. Transportation Potential Impacts of CLIMATE CHANGE on U.S. Transportation TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD SPECIAL REPORT 290 Every mode of transportation in the United States will be affected as the climate changes.Potentially the greatest impact on transportation systems will be the flooding of roads, railways, transit systems, and airport runways in coastal areas because of rising sea levels and surges brought on by more intense storms.Although the impacts ofclimate change will vary by region,they will be widespread and costly in human and economic terms and will require significant changes in the planning,design,construc- tion,operation,and maintenance oftransportation systems. This National Research Council report presents an overview ofthe scientific consen- sus about the current and future climate changes affecting U.S.transportation,including the limits of scientific understanding of the timing, magnitude, and location of the effects;identifies the potential impacts on U.S.transportation and the options for adap- tation;and recommends research and actions to prepare for climate change.The report also summarizes previous work on strategies for reducing the transportation-related emissions ofcarbon dioxide—the primary greenhouse gas—which contribute to climate change.

        "Preface L eading scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change published their fourth assessment ofthe state ofknowledge about climate change and its impacts in spring 2007.They reached con- sensus that human activity is responsible for many observed climate changes, particularly the warming temperatures of the last several decades,and concluded that there is a need for far more extensive adap- tation than is currently occurring to reduce vulnerability to future climate changes. In September 2007, the National Research Council (NRC) released a report examining the U.S. Climate Change Science Program,which oversees federal research on climate change in the United States. The report noted that understanding of the physical climate sys- tem has progressed rapidly but that the use of this knowledge to support decision making,manage risks,and engage stakeholders is inadequate. The transportation sector is a good case in point. Little consensus exists among transportation professionals that climate change is occur- ring or warrants action now. Addressing climate change requires an examination of plausible future scenarios, a long-term perspective, the capacity to deal with uncertain and changing information, and responses that may extend beyond jurisdictional boundaries and trans- portation modal responsibilities. These are significant challenges for transportation professionals. This report is intended to help illuminate the nature of the potential impacts of climate change of greatest rele- vance for U.S. transportation and to suggest appropriate adaptation strategies and organizational responses. ix",
        "x Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation This study was requested by the Executive Committee of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) and was conducted with the Division on Earth and Life Studies (DELS).It was funded by a broad range of organizations, including TRB, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program,the U.S.Department ofTransportation (USDOT),the Transit Cooperative Research Program, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. TRB and DELS formed a committee of 13 members comprising experts in climate science, meteorology, transportation planning and engineering, trans- portation operations and maintenance, risk analysis, and economics to conduct the study.1The committee was chaired by Henry G.Schwartz,Jr., retired president and chairman of Sverdrup/Jacobs Civil,Inc.,and mem- ber of the National Academy of Engineering. To carry out its charge, the committee reviewed the literature in the field,requested numerous briefings,commissioned five papers to explore various aspects of the potential impacts of climate change on U.S.trans- portation, and held a 1-day conference to explore these issues with a broader audience. The commissioned papers provided the committee with important information on various aspects of the impacts of climate change on transportation. The first paper, by Thomas C. Peterson, Marjorie McGuirk, Andrew H. Horvitz, and Tamara Houston of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Michael F. Wehner of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, helped set the stage by identifying the climate factors of greatest relevance for trans- portation, summarizing current understanding of projected climate changes for various U.S. regions, and describing potential impacts on transportation.A paper by Michael D. Meyer of the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute ofTechnology exam- ines the role of transportation design standards in light of potential impacts from climate change.A third paper,by Stephen C.Lockwood of Parsons Brinckerhoff, reviews operational strategies for addressing cli- mate change.

Grenzeback of Cambridge Systematics,Inc.,and Andrew Lukmann ofthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology—a case study of the transportation sector’s response to and recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita—examines the vulnerabili- 1George Philander, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, participated as a member of the committee through 2006, when he resigned because of extended foreign travel and new commitments.",
        "Preface xi ties and strengths ofvarious transportation modes in the event ofa shock to the system.A final paper,by James A.Dewar and Martin Wachs of the Rand Corporation,2 provides a survey of approaches to decision making under uncertainty,drawing on examples from other sectors and suggest- ing possible new approaches for transportation planning and decision making. The papers were reviewed by the committee and discussants at a 1-day conference (see next paragraph) and revised by the authors.They are listed in Appendix C.Because of their length and printing costs,the papers are available only in electronic form.The reader is cautioned that the inter- pretations and conclusions contained in the papers are those of the authors.The key findings endorsed by the committee appear in the body of the report. The committee recognizes that five papers cannot cover the full range of issues facing the transportation sector as it begins to consider the potential impacts of climate change. Thus, a conference was held midway through the study to examine the papers with a broader audi- ence of climate scientists and academicians and practitioners from all transportation modes and to engage the transportation community in particular in considering the potential impacts of climate change.Each paper was presented and critiqued by a commentator,followed by discus- sion by the authors and invited participants. The conference concluded with a summary by two rapporteurs—one from the climate science and one from the transportation community. Of the 144 individuals invited to the conference, 51 attended. Their names and affiliations, along with the conference agenda, can be found in Appendix D. The commentary and critiques of conference participants were considered in both finaliz- ing the authored papers and preparing this final report. The committee also supplemented its expertise with briefings at its meetings from a wide range of experts. In particular, the committee thanks Eric J. Barron, Distinguished Professor of Geosciences and Dean of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, Pennsylvania State University (now at the University of Texas at Austin), who provided the committee with an overview of the scientific consensus on climate change, continuing uncertainties, and implications for transportation. The committee also thanks Michael Savonis,Team Leader for Air Quality, 2The authors both work for the Rand Corporation, but the paper was prepared by the authors as individuals.",

        "Summary T he world’s leading climate scientists have reached consensus that human activity in the form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is warming the planet in ways that will have profound and unsettling impacts on natural resources,energy use,ecosystems,economic activity, and potentially quality of life. The earth’s climate is always in a state of flux, but what is of concern today is the rapid rate of change and the unabated contribution of human activity to its occurrence.Many studies have already examined the potential impacts of climate change on broad sectors of the economy, such as agriculture and forestry, but few have studied the impacts on transportation. The primary focus of this report is on the consequences of climate change1 for the infrastructure and operations of U.S.transportation.2 The report provides transportation professionals with an overview ofthe scien- tific consensus on those current and future climate changes of particular relevance to U.S.transportation,including the limitations ofpresent scien- tific understanding as to their precise timing, magnitude, and geographic location;identifies potential impacts on U.S.transportation and adaptation options; and offers recommendations for both research and actions that can be taken to prepare for climate change. The report also summarizes 1Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or its variability over an extended period, typically decades or longer, that can be attributed to either natural causes or human activity. Weather refers to the familiar hour-by-hour, day-by-day changes in temperature, cloudiness, precipitation, and other atmospheric phenomena. 2In this report, infrastructure refers to both transportation networks (e.g., road and rail systems) and facilities (e.g., bridges, tunnels, ports). All modes of transportation are covered—highways (including bridges and tunnels), rail (including private rail lines and public transportation), marine and air transportation, and pipelines. 1",
        "2 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation previous work on strategies for reducing transportation-related emissions of carbon dioxide (CO )—the primary GHG—that contribute to climate 2 change,a relatively well-researched area (see Appendix B). Climate change will have significant impacts on transportation,affect- ing the way U.S. transportation professionals plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain infrastructure. Decisions taken today, particularly those related to the redesign and retrofitting ofexisting or the location and design ofnew transportation infrastructure,will affect how well the system adapts to climate change far into the future.Focusing on the problem now should help avoid costly future investments and disruptions to operations. The primary objective of this report is to provide guidance for transporta- tion decision makers on how best to proceed. CLIMATE CHANGES OF GREATEST RELEVANCE FOR U.S. TRANSPORTATION Climate change is not just a problem for the future.Recent global climate changes,such as warming temperatures and rising sea levels,likely reflect the effects of GHG emissions into the atmosphere over the past century. Even if drastic measures were taken today to stabilize or eliminate GHG emissions, the effects of climate change would continue to be experi- enced,and U.S.transportation professionals would have to adapt to their consequences. On the basis of current knowledge, climate scientists have identified five climate changes of particular importance to transportation and esti- mated the probability oftheir occurrence during the 21st century (detailed in Box S-1): • Increases in very hot days and heat waves, • Increases in Arctic temperatures, • Rising sea levels, • Increases in intense precipitation events,and • Increases in hurricane intensity. Climate scientists have the greatest confidence in projected changes in mean temperature and other climate factors at the global or continental scale;confidence in these projections diminishes as the geographic scale is",
        "Summary 3 BOX S-1 Climate Change Impacts of Greatest Relevance for U.S. Transportation Increases in very hot days and heat waves. It is highly likely (greater than 90 percent probability of occurrence) that heat extremes and heat waves will continue to become more intense, longer lasting, and more frequent in most regions during the 21st century. In 2007, for example, the probabil- ity of having five summer days at or above 43.3°C (110°F) in Dallas was about 2 percent. In 25 years, this probability increases to 5 percent; in 50 years, to 25 percent; and by 2099, to 90 percent. Increases in Arctic temperatures. Arctic warming is virtually certain (greater than 99 percent probability of occurrence), as temperature increases are expected to be greatest over land and at most high northern latitudes. As much as 90 percent of the upper layer of permafrost could thaw under more pessimistic emission scenarios. The greatest temperature increases in North America are projected to occur in the winter in northern parts of Alaska and Canada as a result of feedback effects of shortened periods of snow cover. By the end of the 21st century, projected warming could range from as much as 10.0°C (18.0°F) in the winter to as little as 2.0°C (3.6°F) in the summer in the northernmost areas. On an annual mean temperature basis for the rest of North America, projected warming ranges from 3.0°C to 5.0°C (5.4°F to 9.0°F), with smaller values near the coasts. Rising sea levels.It is virtually certain (greater than 99 percent probability of occurrence) that sea levels will continue to rise in the 21st century as a result of thermal expansion and loss of mass from ice sheets. The projected global range in sea level rise is from 0.18 m (7.1 in.) to 0.59 m (23.2 in.) by 2099, but the rise will not be geographically uniform. The Atlantic and Gulf Coasts should experience a rise near the global mean, the West Coast a slightly lower rise, and the Arctic Coast a rise of only 0.1 m (3.9 in.). These estimates do not include subsidence in the Gulf and uplift along the New England Coast. Nor do the global projections include the full effects of increased melt- ing of the Greenland and Antarctic ice masses because current understanding of these effects is too limited to permit projection of an upper bound on sea level rise. Increases in intense precipitation events.It is highly likely (greater than 90 per- cent probability of occurrence) that intense precipitation events will continue to become more frequent in widespread areas of the United States.

        "4 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOXS-1 (continued) Climate Change Impacts of Greatest Relevance for U.S. Transportation Increases in hurricane intensity. Increased tropical storm intensities, with larger peak wind speeds and more intense precipitation, are projected as likely (greater than 66 percent probability of occurrence). No robust pro- jections concerning the annual global number of tropical storms have yet emerged from modeling studies, but more detailed analyses focused on the Atlantic Ocean suggest no significant increases in the annual number of Atlantic tropical storms. Note:The primary sources for these data are the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Summary for Policymakers on the Physical Science Basis(Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report); the Peterson et al. 2006 paper commissioned for this study (see Appendix C); numerous other sources that can be found in Chapter 2 (see Table 2-1 and the text discussing each of these impacts); and the committee’s own assessments about the certainty of some impacts, based on the literature. reduced. Nevertheless, climate scientists are now able to project climate changes for large subcontinental regions, such as the eastern United States—a scale better suited to transportation infrastructure, which is regional and local.Projections of future climate are often shown as grad- ual changes, such as the rise in global temperatures projected over this century.However,these changes are unlikely to be experienced in such a smooth manner because those induced by human activity will be ampli- fied in some years by naturally fluctuating conditions, reflected in potentially sudden and dramatic changes at the regional or local level.For example,many climate scientists caution that warming temperatures may trigger weather extremes and surprises,such as more rapid melting of the Arctic sea ice or more rapid rises in sea levels than are projected by cur- rent models. Finding: The past several decades of historical regional climate patterns commonly used by transportation planners to guide their operations and investments may no longer be a reliable guide for future plans.In particular,future climate will include new classes (in terms of magnitude and frequency) of weather and climate",
        "Summary 5 extremes,3 such as record rainfall and record heat waves, not experienced in modern times as human-induced changes are superimposed on the climate’s natural variability. POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON TRANSPORTATION Transportation professionals are keenly aware of the effects of weather on system performance. Transportation infrastructure was designed for typical weather patterns,reflecting local climate and incorporating assumptions about a reasonable range oftemperatures and precipitation levels. Finding: Climate change will affect transportation primarily through increases in several types ofweather and climate extremes, such as very hot days; intense precipitation events; intense hurri- canes; drought; and rising sea levels, coupled with storm surges and land subsidence.The impacts will vary by mode oftransporta- tion and region of the country, but they will be widespread and costly in both human and economic terms and will require signif- icant changes in the planning,design,construction,operation,and maintenance of transportation systems. The infrastructure will be affected most by those climate changes that cause environmental conditions to extend outside the range for which the system was designed (see Table S-1 for illustrative impacts ofkey climate changes). Finding: Potentially, the greatest impact of climate change for North America’s transportation systems will be flooding ofcoastal roads, railways, transit systems, and runways because of global rising sea levels, coupled with storm surges and exacerbated in some locations by land subsidence. Fully 53 percent of the U.S.population now lives in counties with coastal regions,many among the most densely populated in the nation.As retire- ment magnets and tourist destinations with rapidly growing economies, coastal communities will continue to experience development pressures, 3The exact threshold for what is classified as an extreme varies from one analysis to another, but an extreme event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the top or bottom 10 percent of all occurrences. For the purposes of this report, all tornadoes and hurricanes are considered extreme.",

        "8 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation increasing the exposure of people and businesses to harm from extreme weather.The Atlantic and GulfCoasts are particularly vulnerable because they have already experienced high levels oferosion,land subsidence,and loss of wetlands.Seven of the 10 largest U.S.ports (by tons of traffic),as well as significant oil and gas production facilities,are located on the Gulf Coast,an area whose vulnerability to disruption and damage was amply demonstrated during the 2005 tropical storm season. Sea level rise and coastal flooding also pose risks for the East Coast, as well as the Pacific Northwest and parts of the California Coast. The vulnerability of transportation infrastructure to climate change will extend beyond coastal areas.For example,watersheds supplying water to the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes, as well as the Upper Midwest river system,are likely to experience drier conditions,resulting in lower water levels and reduced capacity to ship agricultural and other bulk commodities,although a longer shipping season could offset some of the adverse economic effects.Thawing permafrost in Alaska is already creating settlement and land subsidence problems for roads,rail lines,runways,and pipelines.Higher temperature extremes (mainly heat waves) in some U.S. regions could lead to more frequent buckling of pavements and misalign- ment of rail lines. More severe weather events with intense precipitation could increase the severity of extensive flooding events,such as the storms that plagued the Midwest during the 1993 flooding of the Mississippi and Missouri River system,the Chicago area in 1996,and the Houston region during Tropical Storm Allison in 2001.Flooding of a waterway system can knock out barge operations on the river itself,rail operations on rights-of- way adjacent to the river,and even highway approaches to bridges crossing flooded rivers. Not all climate change impacts will be negative. For example, the marine transportation sector could benefit from more open seas in the Arctic, creating new and shorter shipping routes and reducing transport time and costs. In cold regions, expected temperature rises, particularly decreases in very cold days and later onset of seasonal freezes and earlier onset ofseasonal thaws,could mean reduced costs ofsnow and ice control for departments of transportation and safer travel conditions for passen- ger vehicles and freight. Recommendation 1:Federal,state,and local governments,in collaboration with owners and operators of infrastructure,",
        "Summary 9 such as ports and airports and private railroad and pipeline companies, should inventory critical transportation infra- structure in light ofclimate change projections to determine whether,when,and where projected climate changes in their regions might be consequential. These inventories would need to be updated periodically as new scientific knowledge about climate change becomes available. This would be a relatively low-cost activity because a large portion of the necessary information and tools [e.g., geographic information systems (GIS)] is likely to be available. The inventorying process itself should also help identify with greater precision the data needed from climate scientists on transportation-relevant climate changes. DECISION FRAMEWORK Transportation decision makers have an opportunity now to prepare for projected climate changes. Finding:Public authorities and officials at various governmental levels and executives ofprivate companies are continually making short- and long-term investment decisions that have implications for how the transportation system will respond to climate change in the near and long terms. Recommendation 2:State and local governments and private infrastructure providers should incorporate climate change into their long-term capital improvement plans, facility designs, maintenance practices, operations, and emergency response plans. Taking measures now to evaluate and protect the most vulnerable infrastructure should pay off by diminishing near-term maintenance expenditures and reducing the risk of catastrophic failure,with its toll on human life and economic activity (see Box S-2, which presents a six-step approach for determining appropriate investment priorities). Such mea- sures might include strengthening or elevating some coastal roads,rail lines, and bridges,particularly those that serve as evacuation routes,or upgrad- ing parallel routes where they are available.In the longer term,relocation",
        "10 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX S-2 Decision Framework for Transportation Professionals to Use in Addressing Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Infrastructure 1. Assess how climate changes are likely to affect various regions of the country and modes of transportation. 2. Inventory transportation infrastructure essential to maintaining network performance in light of climate change projections to determine whether, when, and where the impacts could be consequential. 3. Analyze adaptation options to assess the trade-offs between making the infrastructure more robust and the costs involved. Consider monitoring as an option. 4. Determine investment priorities, taking into consideration the criticality of infrastructure components as well as opportunities for multiple benefits (e.g., congestion relief, removal of evacuation route bottlenecks). 5. Develop and implement a program of adaptation strategies for the near and long terms. 6. Periodically assess the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and repeat Steps 1 through 5. of rights-of-way farther inland or installation of costly storm barrier sys- tems to protect selected areas (e.g.,parts ofNew York City or Miami) might be considered.Prudent choices today could avoid some of these costs. Finding: The significant costs of redesigning and retrofitting transportation infrastructure to adapt to potential impacts of climate change suggest the need for more strategic, risk-based approaches to investment decisions. Traditionally,transportation decision makers have not taken full advan- tage of quantitative, risk-based approaches that incorporate uncertainty and probabilistic assessments in making investment and design deci- sions. Nor will past trends provide a reliable guide for future plans and designs as they relate to climate. Recommendation 3: Transportation planners and engineers should use more probabilistic investment analyses and design",
        "Summary 11 approaches that incorporate techniques for trading off the costs of making the infrastructure more robust against the economic costs offailure.At a more general level,these tech- niques could also be used to communicate these trade-offs to policy makers who make investment decisions and authorize funding. One model is the California Seismic Retrofit Program, which uses a risk- based approach for analyzing vulnerability to earthquakes and the criticality ofhighway bridges to determine priorities for retrofitting and replacement. Adapting such techniques to address climate change will require continuing education of current planners and engineers and training of future profes- sionals.It will also require educating policy makers to gain their support and may well necessitate new eligibility criteria in funding programs and new funding sources so the investments identified by the application of these techniques can be made. DATA AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS Transportation decision makers note that one of the most difficult aspects of addressing climate change is obtaining the relevant informa- tion in the form needed for planning and design purposes.Specifically, as noted earlier,climate change is understood with greatest confidence as a global phenomenon,while transportation planners need local and regional climate projections.They also need a better understanding of how projected climate changes, such as changes in temperature and precipitation, will affect the environment (e.g., soil moisture, runoff) in which the infrastructure is situated, which will vary from region to region. Finding:Transportation professionals often lack sufficiently detailed information about expected climate changes and their timing to take appropriate action. Simply put,transportation professionals,climate scientists,hydrologists, and others have not communicated well. Recommendation 4: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation",
        "12 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation (USDOT), the U.S. Geological Survey, and other relevant agencies should work together to institute a process for better communication among transportation professionals, climate scientists, and other relevant scientific disciplines, and estab- lish a clearinghouse for transportation-relevant climate change information. All professions should benefit from the collaboration.Transportation pro- fessionals would be encouraged to define with greater precision the climate data needed to make better transportation decisions,such as tem- perature and precipitation thresholds at finer-grained geographic scales or climate conditions that would create unacceptable performance outcomes. Climate scientists would be challenged to elaborate on the possibilities and limitations ofprojecting the impacts ofclimate change at the levels ofgeo- graphic specificity that are most useful for transportation planners.And hydrologists and others would be challenged to consider how the environ- ment would influence these effects and their impacts on transportation infrastructure. Finding: Better decision support tools are also needed to assist transportation decision makers. Recommendation 5: Ongoing and planned research at fed- eral and state agencies and universities that provide climate data and decision support tools should include the needs of transportation decision makers. For example, the research program of the USDOT Center for Climate Change and Environmental Forecasting could be charged with expanding its existing research program in this area and provided the necessary fund- ing.Needed tools include highly accurate digital elevation maps in coastal areas for forecasting the effects of flooding and storm surge heights; GIS that can be used to map the locations of critical infrastructure, overlaid with information on climate change effects (e.g.,sea level rise,permafrost melt);greater use of scenarios that include climate change in the develop- ment of long-range regional transportation plans to pinpoint likely vulnerabilities and ways to address them; and better network models for examining the systemwide effects of the loss of critical transportation infrastructure links.",
        "Summary 13 ADAPTATION OPTIONS Numerous studies have examined ways of mitigating the transportation sector’s contribution to global warming from GHG emissions. Far less attention has been paid to the potential impacts of climate change on U.S. transportation and how transportation professionals can best adapt to cli- mate changes that are already occurring and will continue to occur into the foreseeable future,even if drastic mitigation measures were taken today. Operational Responses Climate extremes and abrupt changes, such as storms and precipitation of increased intensity,will require near-term operational responses from transportation providers. U.S. transportation providers already address the impacts of weather on transportation system operations in a diverse range of climatic conditions.For example,snow and ice control accounts for about 40 percent of annual highway operating budgets in the north- ern states. Likewise, hurricane planning has become a major focus of transportation operations in the Gulf Coast states,where transportation providers are forging close relationships with emergency responders to handle severe weather events. As climate changes induce new extremes, operational responses are likely to become more routine and proactive than today’s approach of treating severe weather on an ad hoc, emergency basis. For example, if hurricanes increase in intensity,as is likely to be the case,establishment of evacuation routes and use of contraflow operations may become as com- monplace as the current use of snow emergency routes in the Northeast and Midwest.More accurate and timely weather prediction and commu- nication of storm warnings in real time to those potentially in harm’s way will become more important. Finding: Projected increases in extreme weather and climate underscore the importance ofemergency response plans in vulner- able locations and require that transportation providers work more closely with weather forecasters and emergency planners and assume a greater role in evacuation planning and emergency response. Recommendation 6: Transportation agencies and service providers should build on the experience in those locations",
        "14 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation where transportation is well integrated into emergency response and evacuation plans. Monitoring and Use of Technology Monitoring infrastructure conditions,particularly the impacts of extreme climate changes, offers an alternative to preventive retrofitting or recon- struction of some facilities. In Alaska, for example, the Alyeska Pipeline Company constantly monitors the right-of-way of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to spot land subsidence problems, particularly along the 800 miles of pipeline elevated on vertical supports.Alaskan engineers also closely monitor bridge supports that are experiencing damage from earlier winter runoff and increased stream flow. In the future, sensors and other smart technologies could be embedded in the infrastructure to monitor cli- mate conditions and impacts. Finding: Greater use of technology would enable infrastructure providers to monitor climate changes and receive advance warn- ing of potential failures due to water levels and currents, wave action, winds, and temperatures exceeding what the infrastruc- ture was designed to withstand. Recommendation 7:Federal and academic research programs should encourage the development and implementation of monitoring technologies that could provide advance warning of pending failures due to the effects of weather and climate extremes on major transportation facilities. Sharing of Best Practices As the climate changes,many U.S.locations will experience new climate- induced weather patterns. Finding:The geographic extent ofthe United States—from Alaska to Florida and from Maine to Hawaii—and its diversity ofweather and climate conditions can provide a laboratory for identifying best practices and sharing information as the climate changes. Recommendation 8: The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO),the Federal",
        "Summary 15 Highway Administration, the Association of American Railroads,the American Public Transportation Association, the American Association of Port Authorities, the Airport Operators Council,associations for oil and gas pipelines,and other relevant transportation professional and research organizations should develop a mechanism to encourage sharing ofbest practices for addressing the potential impacts ofclimate change. This effort should build on existing technology transfer mechanisms, such as AASHTO’s technology-sharing program. Technology should be defined broadly to include probabilistic decision-making tools,as well as monitoring technologies,new materials,and operating and maintenance strategies. Design Changes Environmental factors are integral to the design of transportation infra- structure. Conditions such as temperature, freeze–thaw cycles, and duration and intensity of precipitation determine subsurface and founda- tion design,choice ofmaterials,and drainage capacity.Engineers,however, have given little thought to whether current design standards are sufficient to accommodate climate change. For example, will drainage capacity be adequate for expected increases in intense precipitation events? Many infra- structure components are currently designed for the 100-year storm—an event ofsuch severity that it occurs,on average,once in 100 years.But pro- jections indicate that what is today’s 100-year precipitation event is likely to occur every 50 or perhaps even every 20 years by the end of the current century.What new materials might be needed when very hot temperatures and heat waves become more frequent? Are infrastructure components sufficiently strong to withstand the forces of larger and more frequent storm surges and more powerful wave action, the effects of which were vividly demonstrated when Hurricane Katrina simply lifted bridge decks off their supporting structures? Finding:Reevaluating,developing,and regularly updating design standards for transportation infrastructure to address the impacts of climate change will require a broad-based research and testing program and a substantial implementation effort.",
        "16 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Developing consensus standards is a time-consuming process.Changes in design practices tend to be incremental,and building to higher standards must be weighed against the cost involved.Thus there is a need for a selec- tive,risk-based approach to making changes in standards that focuses first on long-lived facilities,such as bridges and large culverts.A good model is the congressionally mandated National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program,begun in 1977,which established a research effort and a coordi- nation mechanism designed to reduce the risks to life and property from earthquakes through standards that would afford different levels ofprotec- tion for different levels of risk. If a similar program is to be launched to address climate change in a timely manner,it should be initiated soon. Recommendation 9: USDOT should take a leadership role, along with those professional organizations in the forefront of civil engineering practice across all modes,to initiate immedi- ately a federally funded, multiagency research program for ongoing reevaluation of existing and development of new design standards as progress is made in understanding future climate conditions and the options available for addressing them.A research plan and cost proposal should be developed for submission to Congress for authorization and funding of this program. The initial focus should be on essential links in transportation networks, particularly those vulnerable to climate change in coastal or other low- lying areas in riverside locations. Recommendation 10: In the short term, state and federally funded transportation infrastructure rehabilitation projects in highly vulnerable locations should be rebuilt to higher stan- dards,and greater attention should be paid to the provision of redundant power and communications systems to ensure rapid restoration of transportation services in the event of failure. The development of appropriate design standards to accommodate climate change is only one of several possible adaptation strategies. Finding: Federal agencies have not focused generally on adapta- tion in addressing climate change.",
        "Summary 17 Recommendation 11: USDOT should take the lead in devel- oping an interagency working group focused on adaptation. This initiative would not necessarily require new funding beyond that rec- ommended above.Better collaboration among agencies could help focus attention on adaptation issues and shape existing research programs. Transportation Planning and Land Use Controls One ofthe most effective strategies for reducing the risks ofclimate change is to avoid placing people and infrastructure in vulnerable locations. Transportation planners currently consider expected land use patterns when forecasting future travel demand and infrastructure needs.However, they rarely question whether such development is desirable, much less what effects climate change might have on the provision and development of infrastructure in vulnerable locations.In part,this situation stems from governance arrangements.States,regional authorities,and the private sec- tor are responsible for large-scale transportation investment decisions,but local governments and a few states control land use decisions through comprehensive plans,zoning ordinances,permitting,and building codes. Finding: Transportation planners are not currently required to consider climate change impacts and their effects on infrastruc- ture investments,particularly in vulnerable locations. Recommendation 12: Federal planning regulations should require that climate change be included as a factor in the devel- opment of public-sector long-range transportation plans; eliminate any perception that such plans should be limited to 20 to 30 years;and require collaboration in plan development with agencies responsible for land use, environmental pro- tection, and natural resource management to foster more integrated transportation–land use decision making. Current surface transportation legislation encourages such collabora- tion.During reauthorization,requiring transportation planners to both consider climate change and collaborate with land use planners in the preparation ofpublic-sector long-range plans could go a long way toward putting these issues on the table.At the same time,any strategy employing land use controls to address climate change would need to build consen-",
        "18 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation sus among key decision makers in transportation and land use,probably at the regional level—a challenging proposition. Finding: Locally controlled land use planning, which is typical throughout the country, has too limited a perspective to account for the broadly shared risks of climate change. Insurance Private insurers may be able to accomplish what government cannot in terms of land use control.Some major insurers,for example,are refusing to write new or renew existing homeowners’policies in areas already vul- nerable to hurricanes and other severe storms,which could intensify in a warming climate.Florida,Texas,Louisiana,Mississippi,Hawaii,New York City, and Long Island are among the areas affected thus far. Some states have stepped up to become insurers of last resort for coastal homes and businesses,but the high costs ofproviding coverage are unlikely to be sus- tainable.Moreover,the provision of insurance in hazard-prone areas that is not actuarially based is bad public policy. The federal government is the insurer of last resort for homeowners in specially designated flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program ofthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides homeowners with below-cost insurance. In return, the local community must adopt and enforce floodplain management measures, including building code ordinances for new construction and rebuilding after a dis- aster,to reduce flood damage.Critics contend that in practice,the program has resulted in more development than would otherwise have occurred in these areas.Moreover,the accuracy of flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) used to determine program eligibility is woefully inadequate, despite a mapping modernization program.Flood hazard area boundaries are keyed to the 100-year storm,and base elevation data are inadequate. Finding:The National Flood Insurance Program and the FIRMs used to determine program eligibility do not take climate change into account. Recommendation 13:FEMA should reevaluate the risk reduc- tion effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program and the FIRMs,particularly in view of projected increases in",
        "Summary 19 intense precipitation and storms. At a minimum, updated flood zone maps that account for sea level rise (incorporating land subsidence) should be a priority in coastal areas. New Organizational Arrangements The impacts of climate change do not follow modal,corporate,or jurisdic- tional boundaries, yet decision making in the transportation sector is structured around these boundaries.Transportation planning is conducted primarily at the regional level,often through a bottom-up process that starts with local jurisdictions.Railroads,trucking,and waterborne commerce are largely private enterprises with varying levels offederal participation.Thus, existing institutional arrangements are not well suited to addressing cli- mate change.Some models of cross-jurisdictional cooperation exist,such as regional authorities for specific facilities (e.g.,the Alameda Corridor) and multistate emergency response agreements.In addition,there are models of state-mandated regional authorities, as is the case for regional air quality improvement authorities.Organizational arrangements suited to address- ing the impacts of climate change may require state or federal action. Finding: Current institutional arrangements for transportation planning and operations were not organized to address climate change and may not be adequate for the purpose. Recommendation 14: Incentives incorporated in federal and state legislation should be considered as a means of address- ing and mitigating the impacts of climate change through regional and multistate efforts. For example,states could use updated FIRMs or their own state maps to identify geographic areas vulnerable to climate change and craft policies for restricting transportation investments and limiting insurance in these locations. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS The committee finds compelling scientific evidence that climate change is occurring and that it will trigger new, extreme weather events and could possibly lead to surprises,such as more rapid than expected rises in",
        "20 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation sea levels or temperature changes. Every mode of transportation will be affected as climate change poses new and often unfamiliar challenges to infrastructure providers. The committee urges that the transportation community start now to confront these challenges. A strong federal role is needed to implement many of the committee’s recommendations that require broad-based action or regulation, such as creation of a clearinghouse for information on transportation and climate change, the research program to reevaluate existing and develop new design standards for addressing climate change,creation of an interagency working group on adaptation, changes in federal regulations regarding long-range planning guidelines and infrastructure rehabilitation require- ments,and reevaluation of the National Flood Insurance Program. Many of the committee’s recommendations, however, need not await federal action.Local governments and private infrastructure providers can begin to identify critical infrastructure that is particularly vulnerable to cli- mate change. Professional organizations can begin to amass examples of best practice, and planners and climate scientists at local universities and research institutes can begin to collaborate on the development ofregional scenarios of likely transportation-related climate changes and the data needed to analyze their impacts.The most important step,however,is for transportation professionals to acknowledge that the time has come to confront the challenges posed by climate change and to incorporate the most current scientific knowledge into the planning,design,construction, operation,and maintenance of transportation systems.",
        "1 Introduction C limate scientists are projecting changes in the global climate with potentially profound impacts on agriculture and forest productivity, ecosystems, water resources, and energy, as well as related socioeconomic effects.1 Increases in annual globally averaged mean temperatures, in the number of warm days and nights over mid- and high-latitude land areas, and in temperature and precipitation extremes all are projected to occur with a high degree of confidence2 during the 21st century. These changes will bring about the retreat of sea ice and the thawing of glaciers and ice caps, particularly at high northern latitudes; rising sea levels; and greater flooding and higher storm surges along vulnerable coastal and riverine areas.The finer the geographic resolution and the longer the temporal pro- jections, the greater are the uncertainties surrounding estimates of future climate change.The respective roles of human and natural causes in these changes have now been well established (IPCC 2007b). Numerous studies have examined the link between climate change and the transportation sector. These studies have been conducted primarily 1Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or its variability over an extended period, typically decades or longer, that can be attributed to either natural causes or human activity (IPCC 2007a). This definition is drawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was jointly established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme in 1988 to assess the available scientific and socioeconomic information on climate change and its impacts and on options for mitigating those impacts and developing adaptive responses. 2 Climate scientists express uncertainty in a variety of ways. To encourage greater uniformity in communicating uncertainty, lead authors of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report were provided guidance on how to treat issues of uncertainty and statistical confidence in a consistent manner (IPCC 2005). The term “high degree of confidence” means consistency across model projections and/or consistency with theory and/or changes in the mean. See Chapter 2 for a more detailed discussion of uncertainty. 21",
        "22 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation from the perspective of transportation’s contribution to global warming through the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide (CO ) 2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere.3CO from com- 2 bustion of fossil fuels is the largest source of U.S.GHG emissions.In 2005, the most recent year for which data are available,the transportation sector accounted for 33 percent of U.S. CO emissions from fossil fuel combus- 2 tion,4exceeded only by electricity generation by the electric power industry at 41 percent (USEPA 2007, Table 3-7).5 CO emissions from U.S. trans- 2 portation activities are expected to increase over the next several decades, primarily as a result ofgrowth in road travel,fueled by population and eco- nomic growth (World Business Council for Sustainable Development 2004). However, these emissions are likely to be regulated. In a landmark decision in April 2007 (Massachusetts et al., Petitioners, v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate GHG emissions and that CO can be construed as an air 2 pollutant under the statute. Far less attention has been paid to the consequences ofpotential climate changes for U.S.transportation infrastructure and operations.6,7For exam- ple, projected rising sea levels, flooding, and storm surges could swamp marine terminal facilities,airport runways near coastlines,subway and rail- road tunnel entrances, and roads and bridges in low-lying coastal areas. 3 CO and other GHGs allow sunlight to enter and prevent heat from leaving the earth’s atmosphere— 2 the so-called greenhouse effect, loosely analogous to the operation of a greenhouse window. Higher concentrations of CO and other GHGs than occur naturally trap excess heat in the atmosphere and 2 warm the earth’s surface (Staudt et al. 2005). 4 Emissions from combustion of both aviation and marine international bunker fuels (i.e., fuel loaded on transport vehicles in the United States but consumed in international operations) are excluded from this total. See Appendix B for a more detailed discussion of the transportation sector’s contribution in general, and the U.S. contribution in particular, to worldwide GHG emissions, particularly emissions of CO from fuel combustion. 2 5 The total is larger if emissions from the extraction, production, and distribution of transport fuels and from the manufacture, distribution, and disposal of transportation vehicles are summed to produce a total life-cycle emissions estimate (see the discussion in Appendix B). 6 In this report, infrastructure refers to both transportation networks (e.g., road and rail systems) and facilities (e.g., bridges, tunnels, ports). 7 In fact, a recent assessment of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) found that the scientific community is not well structured to develop information that would enable adaptive response for any sector in the United States (NRC 2007).

        "Introduction 23 Across the northern portions ofthe contiguous United States,warmer tem- peratures and reduced lake ice will likely lead to increased evaporation from bodies of water and their surrounding watersheds,potentially lower- ing lake and river levels and reducing vessel-carrying capacity. Shipping across the Great Lakes and the Upper Midwest river system would thereby be impaired, although a longer shipping season would offset some of the adverse economic effects.Thawing permafrost in Alaska is already creating settlement and land subsidence problems for roads, rail lines, runways, and pipelines.Greater temperature extremes (mainly heat waves) in some U.S.regions could lead to buckling ofpavements and misalignment ofrail lines. More intense precipitation could increase the severity of flooding events, such as the storms that plagued the Midwest during the flooding of the Mississippi River in 1993 and the Chicago area in 1996. More intense tropical storms, like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005,are likely to become more frequent.However,no significant increases in the annual number of Atlantic tropical storms are projected. The vulnerability8ofthe transportation sector to these impacts has not been thoroughly studied,nor has it been widely considered by transporta- tion planners and decision makers in planning, designing, constructing, retrofitting, and operating the transportation infrastructure. Many trans- portation professionals are unaware of the problems climate change could create.Others are hesitant to take action in view ofthe uncertain outcomes and long time frames involved and the lack of clear guidelines and stan- dards for addressing the effects of climate change and related hazards. STUDY CHARGE, SCOPE, AND AUDIENCE The Executive Committee of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) requested and provided funding for this study, which was undertaken jointly with the Division on Earth and Life Studies of the National 8 One in-depth assessment of impacts in the Gulf Coast region, entitled Impacts of Climate Change and Variability on Transportation Systems and Infrastructure: Gulf Coast Study,was ongoing during the course of this study. It became available for public comment only after the committee had completed its deliberations.

The expert committee formed to conduct the study was charged9 to • Provide federal,state,and local transportation officials in the United States with an overview of the scientific consensus regarding climate change,including uncertainty about its nature and extent; • Summarize previous work on strategies for reducing transporta- tion’s impact on climate change; • Summarize possible impacts on transportation,such as those due to rising sea levels,higher mean temperatures with less extreme low temperatures and more heat extremes,and more frequent intense precipitation events; • Analyze options for adapting to these impacts,including the possi- ble need to alter assumptions about infrastructure design and operations,the ability to incorporate uncertainty into long-range decision making,and the capability of institutions to plan and act on mitigation and adaptation strategies at the state and regional levels; • Identify critical areas for research;and • Suggest policies and actions for preparing for the potential impacts of climate change. The committee’s charge can be viewed more broadly as a risk manage- ment problem with hazards to address (potential impacts of climate change) and vulnerable10 assets to protect (transportation infrastructure). Seen in this framework, the objective is to minimize risk by reducing the hazards (i.e.,identify mitigation measures to reduce the potential effects of climate change) and protecting the assets (i.e., identify adaptation mea- 9 A more detailed statement of task is included as Appendix A. 10 In this report, the term “vulnerability” is defined as “the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity” (IPCC 2007a, 21). The committee notes that there is a large literature on vulnerability as it relates to many hazards and cites Turner et al. (2003) as an example of a broad vulnerability framework and its application to several different types of hazards and affected communities in case studies.",
        "Introduction 25 sures11 to strengthen the infrastructure and increase its resilience to changing climate conditions through more stringent design standards and construction codes and retrofitting or relocation of at-risk facilities).12 The primary focus ofthis report is on adaptation strategies rather than on strategies to mitigate transportation-related GHG emissions.The topic of adaptation, particularly as it relates to transportation, has not received the attention or research effort devoted to the issue of mitigation. In- vestigating both topics fully was beyond the resources available for this study. In fact, at the time of this writing, TRB had initiated a new study focused entirely on mitigation.13 Nevertheless, in response to its charge and drawing heavily on existing studies,committee member George Eads, with the consensus of the full committee, summarized current and pro- jected contributions of the transportation sector to GHG emissions and examined numerous technological and nontechnological mitigation strategies (see Appendix B).The analysis did not attempt to pick winners and losers by comparing the costs and benefits of alternative mitigation approaches.Indeed,the data for doing so were not available.That level of analysis would require a separate study or even a series of studies. The committee was mindful of the potential interaction between miti- gation and adaptation strategies as shown in Figure 1-1.For example,ifthe fuel consumption and CO emissions and concentrations oftransportation 2 vehicles could be substantially reduced by the introduction of new tech- nologies, this would lessen the human-caused contribution to climate change and its impacts on transportation infrastructure. Reductions in travel demand or shifts to less GHG-emitting travel modes (e.g., public transit for personal travel and rail for freight travel) would operate in a sim- ilar fashion.The summary of Appendix B notes,however,that a common 11 Adaptation strategies refer to human attempts to protect or adapt systems so as to reduce the risks and moderate the potential harm from and exploit the beneficial opportunities of the impacts of climate change. Mitigation strategies refer to human intervention to reduce the sources of GHGs that contribute to climate change. 12 Until researchers can quantify both the severity of expected outcomes and their probabilities, however, a full risk assessment is not possible. 13 The study on potential energy savings and GHG reductions will review policies and strategies to affect behavior and improve fuel economy for passenger and freight vehicles across all modes; develop scenarios to illustrate potential savings over a 25- to 50-year time horizon for the United States; and analyze the safety, economic, transportation finance, and environmental consequences of energy-saving measures.",

        "Introduction 27 to inform transportation professionals about climate change—including uncertainty as to its precise timing and geographic locations—so they can begin to consider appropriate responses. The report encompasses all modes of transportation—highways (including bridges and tunnels), rail (including private rail lines and public transportation), marine and air transportation, and pipelines. Its primary focus is on the direct impacts of climate change on transporta- tion infrastructure and system operating performance,although indirect impacts are noted (e.g.,potential shifts in the location ofeconomic activ- ities and use of transportation modes,pollution impacts).These indirect impacts are highly uncertain because they depend on assumptions about population and economic growth, the rate of technological innovation, and policy decisions (e.g.,government regulations and controls on coastal land use and development,private-sector decisions about business oper- ations and logistics). The geographic scope of the study is confined to the United States but extends beyond the contiguous 48 states to include Alaska,Hawaii,and the U.S.territories.15The range of weather and climate conditions16embraced by this area is broad—from the permafrost conditions of Alaska to the tropical conditions ofPuerto Rico and Hawaii.Thus,the United States can expect a wide range of climate changes and their impacts.International studies were reviewed for techniques and approaches that might be appro- priate to the United States.However,the committee found few studies that address the impact of climate change on transportation and adaptation strategies. The audience for this report is the transportation community broadly defined. The overall goal of the report is to demonstrate to decision makers responsible for transportation infrastructure—both public and private—why they should plan for climate change.At the same time,an attempt is made to moderate expectations about the level of precision with which the report can provide guidance on specific impacts of cli- mate change and their time frames. 15 Information on climate change effects and impacts, however, is not always available for smaller geographic areas. 16 Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or its variability over an extended period, typically decades or longer, that can be attributed to either natural causes or human activity. Weather refers to the familiar hour-by-hour, day-by-day changes in temperature, cloudiness, precipitation, and other atmospheric phenomena.",
        "28 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation WHY CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS When asked to consider climate change, transportation professionals fre- quently protest that dealing with a problem whose time horizon is decades and centuries and whose effects are uncertain is impractical. Moreover, they maintain, resources are insufficient to address day-to-day mainte- nance problems, much less to make investments on the basis of changes that may or may not occur years or even generations into the future. So why should transportation professionals take note of climate change? First,it is not just a problem for the future.Recent changes,such as global warming and resulting sea level rises,reflect the effects of GHG emissions that were released into the atmosphere over the past century. What appears to be new is the greater certainty of scientists that human activity is already warming the climate and that the rate ofchange is likely to be greater than at any time in modern history (IPCC 2007b). Second, climate change will not necessarily occur gradually. Climate scientists expect that higher temperatures will be amplified by normal vari- ability in climate, leading to new extremes far outside current experience [e.g.,the heat wave in Europe in 2003 (Stott et al.2004) and the near record heat of 2006 in the United States (Hoerling et al.2007)].Higher tempera- tures are also likely to trigger surprises,such as more rapid than expected melting ofArctic sea ice and rising sea levels. Third, although transportation professionals typically plan 20 to 30 years into the future,many decisions taken today,particularly about the location of infrastructure,help shape development patterns and mar- kets that endure far beyond these planning horizons. Similarly, decisions about land use, zoning, and development often create demand for long- lived transportation infrastructure investments. Thus, it is important for transportation decision makers to consider potential impacts of climate change now in making these investment choices because those impacts will affect how well the infrastructure adapts to climate change. Fourth, professionals in many fields—among them finance, building (where protecting against earthquakes,wildfires,or wind risk is a concern), nuclear power, and water resources (in the design of dams and canals)— are continually making decisions in the face of uncertain information about risks and outcomes. In fact, the highway and bridge engineering community, through the auspices of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials,has developed design guidelines and",
        "Introduction 29 standards for earthquake resistance on the basis ofprobabilistic seismic haz- ard assessments that take many uncertainties into account. Similarly, addressing climate change requires more quantitative assessments,such as the development of probabilistic climate change scenarios at the level of geographic and modal specificity needed by transportation planners and engineers, which can be incorporated into planning forecasts and engi- neering design guidelines and standards. Finally, transportation professionals already consider weather- and climate-related factors in designing and operating the transportation infrastructure. For example, many transportation networks and facilities are designed with adequate drainage and pumping capacity to handle a 100-year storm.17Materials and maintenance cycles are geared to assump- tions about temperature and precipitation levels. Evacuation plans and routes have been identified in hurricane- and other storm-prone locations on the basis of current elevations and assumptions about storm surges and wave action.But what if the 100-year storm were to become the 50- or 30-year storm,or design thresholds were frequently to be exceeded,or evacuation routes themselves were to become vulnerable (see Box 1-1)? Such changes could necessitate different design criteria,asset management policies,maintenance cycles,and operating strategies.Recent severe weather events—such as the Mississippi River floods of1993,Category 3 or greater hurricanes (e.g., Ivan, Katrina, Rita), the California wildfires of 2003— provide ample opportunities for transportation professionals to observe the vulnerabilities of the infrastructure to shocks to the system that could become more commonplace in the future. They also illustrate the dilemma facing transportation decision makers of whether to rebuild, rebuild differently,or relocate critical transportation infrastructure. STUDY APPROACH AND KEY ISSUES A wide range of climate changes could affect transportation infrastruc- ture and result in changes in the way U.S. transportation professionals plan, design, operate, and maintain the infrastructure. The committee adapted a figure from a workshop conducted by the U.S.Department of 17 A 100-year storm is defined as the amount of rainfall during a specified length of time that has a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year or, put another way, has a recurrence interval of 100 years.",
        "30 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX 1-1 What If? • What if design lives for infrastructure and return periods were to be exceeded routinely? Many facilities are built to withstand a 100-year storm. The design of other facilities, such as bridges, assumes a 50-year storm and does not take into account the effect of wave action, vividly illustrated by Hurricane Katrina (Meyer 2006). What if the 50-year storm, or even the 100-year storm, were to be exceeded routinely, reducing pro- jected recurrence periods to much below one in 50 or one in 100 years? • What if multiple severe weather events were to occur? Each year, Florida and the Gulf Coast brace for hurricanes, and California prepares for wild- fires or heavy rains. Emergency personnel are generally able to handle these events, and transportation managers find alternative routes to keep freight moving, largely because the events occur sequentially and at rel- atively infrequent intervals. But consider the impact of a Category 4 or 5 hurricane directed at Houston and its critical petrochemical infrastruc- ture at the same time that torrential rains and mudslides prevent access to the Port of Los Angeles. How would emergency responders and the economy fare in the face of multiple and simultaneous intense storms that climate change could bring with greater frequency? • What if critical evacuation routes were themselves to become sub- merged by rising seas and storm surge? Population increases in coastal areas are projected to more than double in the next 20 years. Many sea- side communities count on coastal highways for evacuation in a major storm. Some of these highways also act as flood barriers. What if the current accelerating rate of sea level rise were to continue into the fore- seeable future? Highways in low-lying areas that provide a vital lifeline could themselves become compromised by encroaching seas and storm surge. Some communities could be cut off in a severe storm or would be forced to evacuate well in advance of the storm’s known trajectory to avoid that risk. In the longer term, it may be possible to relocate some coastal highways farther inland and still provide a means of egress for vulnerable communities.",
        "Introduction 31 Transportation (USDOT 2003) on the potential impacts of climate change on transportation (Potter and Savonis 2003) to provide a concep- tual framework for this study (Figure 1-2). The first task is to identify potential climate change effects, focusing on those of greatest relevance for transportation (see Column 1). This task also includes indicating what is known from climate scientists about the certainty ofthese effects, particularly at the regional and local levels, and the time frame over which they are likely to unfold. The second task (see Column 2) involves describing the impacts of the effects of climate change on transportation.These impacts can be consid- ered in several different ways—by type of climate change effect (e.g., sea level rise, temperature extremes), by transportation mode, by geographic area, and by type of impact. With regard to the latter, impacts on trans- portation can be direct (i.e.,affecting the physical infrastructure as well as 1. Potential Climate 2. Impacts on U.S. 3.

        "32 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation the operating performance of the system) or indirect (e.g., affecting the location ofeconomic activities or levels ofpollution).Finally,these impacts will be influenced by changes in the environment in which the infrastruc- ture is situated.For example,changes in temperature and precipitation will affect soil moisture and runoff,which in turn will affect peak stream flows, sediment delivery to coasts, and the sustainability of the landforms upon which the infrastructure is built,with considerable regional variability.The tasks listed in Columns 1 and 2 require good communication among cli- mate scientists, transportation professionals, and other relevant scientific disciplines. The final task (see Column 3) requires developing possible adaptation strategies.A range ofapproaches is suggested—from the identification of at-risk critical infrastructure,to the monitoring ofconditions (both climate and infrastructure),to changes in operating and maintenance practices,to changes in infrastructure design and redesign,to relocation of vulnerable infrastructure.The strategies listed in this column require action primar- ily by transportation decision makers—planners,designers,engineers,and operating and maintenance personnel. Figure 1-2 links together potential climate change effects, impacts on U.S.transportation infrastructure,and possible adaptation strategies,but it does not fully address several key points.First,issues of scale affect the certainty with which the effects ofclimate change on transportation infra- structure can be examined at present.Climate change projections are most accurate at the global level, but transportation infrastructure is largely local and regional.Nevertheless,the ability to predict climate change at the local and regional levels is improving. Furthermore, the effects of climate change are not point specific;their impacts may differ even within a region, depending on location.For example,sea level rise will affect coastal regions, but the seriousness of the impact will depend on the elevation,the amount of land subsidence,and the extent of protection (e.g.,levees) provided and the redundancy of vulnerable infrastructure in the affected areas. The network character of transportation infrastructure adds another layer ofcomplexity.Adverse impacts ofclimate change on transportation facilities in one region,for example,may shift activity to another location or route,either temporarily,as was the case for freight movement in the wake ofHurricane Katrina,or in the longer term (e.g.,shifts in port activ- ity resulting from new shipping routes opening as a result of warming and deepening seas),with net effects that may be positive or negative.",
        "Introduction 33 Differences in time frames are another complicating factor. Some cli- mate changes will unfold over decades and centuries, ostensibly allowing time for transportation decision makers to plan and respond.Others are likely to increase the sensitivity of the climate system and could bring surprises and abrupt changes that would make planning difficult.18 The lifetime of transportation infrastructure can be as little as 10 to 20 years (e.g., some pavement surfaces), allowing engineers to adapt to some cli- mate changes as they unfold. Many other transportation networks and facilities are longer-lived. Major bridges and pipelines, for example, have lifetimes of50 to 100 years,while the right-of-way ofmajor transportation networks (e.g.,rail lines,roads) is easily that long-lived.Thus,many of the investment decisions made by transportation professionals today will have a significant effect on how well the infrastructure adapts to climate change. Finally, like so many other problems, climate change will not be experienced in isolation. It will manifest itself in the context of other demographic,social,and economic trends,often aggravating existing con- ditions.For example,many coastal areas are likely to experience increased development pressures as a result of population growth,greater affluence, and tourist demands.Many ofthese areas are already vulnerable to erosion and storm damage.As sea levels rise with global warming,coastal storms with higher tides and storm surges are likely to create the conditions for more severe coastal flooding and erosion, placing more people in harm’s way and increasing the difficulty of evacuating in an emergency. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT The remainder of this report addresses the committee’s charge.Chapter 2 reviews the current state of knowledge about climate change, including projected changes over the next century, and those factors of particular relevance to U.S. transportation. Chapter 3 is focused on the potential impacts ofclimate changes on transportation infrastructure.The chapter begins with an overview ofthe vulnerability ofthe infrastructure to these changes; it then examines the likely impacts of the most critical climate changes by transportation mode,reviews the handful ofstudies that have examined the impacts of climate change on transportation,and draws a 18 Evidence exists for abrupt climate changes that can occur within a decade.

        "2 Understanding Climate Change T his chapter begins with an overview ofcurrent understanding ofthe role greenhouse gases (GHGs) play in the atmosphere and evidence for how they are already influencing the earth’s climate in both general and specific ways.The discussion includes a review of the climate change projections of global climate models and some of the evidence that has led recent national and international scientific assessments—including those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007), the National Research Council (2001), and the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) Synthesis and Assessment Report 1.1 (Karl et al. 2006)—to link the rise in temperature, particularly since the 1970s, to increases in GHGs.Next is a discussion ofthe projected climate changes for North America most relevant for U.S. transportation. For each climate variable, past projections and key uncertainties are also discussed. The chapter ends with a series of findings. OVERVIEW OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE The Greenhouse Effect and Atmospheric Composition The natural “greenhouse”effect is real and is an essential component ofthe planet’s climatic processes.A small proportion (roughly 2 percent) of the atmosphere is, and long has been, composed of GHGs (water vapor, car- bon dioxide,ozone,and methane).These gases effectively prevent part of the heat radiated by the earth’s surface from otherwise escaping to space. The response of the global system to this trapped heat is a climate that is warmer than it would be without the presence of these gases; in their 36",
        "Understanding Climate Change 37 absence, the earth’s temperature would be too low to support life as we know it.Among the GHGs,water vapor is by far the most dominant,but other gases augment its effect through greater trapping of heat in certain portions of the electromagnetic (light) spectrum. In addition to the natural greenhouse effect outlined above,a change is under way in the greenhouse radiation balance.Some GHGs are prolif- erating in the atmosphere because of human activities and increasingly trapping more heat.Direct atmospheric measurements made over the past 50 years have documented steady growth in the atmospheric abundance of carbon dioxide (CO ).In addition to these direct,real-time measurements, 2 ice cores have revealed the atmospheric CO concentrations of the distant 2 past.Measurements using air bubbles trapped within layers of accumulat- ing snow show that atmospheric CO has increased by nearly 35 percent 2 over the Industrial Era (since 1750),compared with its relatively constant abundance over at least the preceding 10,000 years (see Figure 2-1). The predominant causes of this increase in CO are the combustion of fossil 2 fuels and deforestation. Further, the abundance of methane has doubled over the Industrial Era, although its increase has slowed during the past decade for reasons not clearly understood. Other heat-trapping gases are also increasing as a result of human activities.Scientists are unable to state with certainty the rate at which these GHGs will continue to increase because ofuncertainties in future emissions,as well as in how these emis- sions will be taken up by the atmosphere, land, and oceans. They are certain,however,that once in the atmosphere,these gases have a relatively long residence time, on the order of a century (IPCC 2001). This means they become well mixed across the globe. There is no doubt that the composition of the atmosphere is affected by human activities. Today GHGs are the largest human influence on atmospheric composition. The increase in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere implies a positive radiative forcing (i.e.,a tendency to warm the climate system). Increases in heat-trapping GHGs are projected to be amplified by feed- back effects, such as changes in water vapor, snow cover, and sea ice. As atmospheric concentrations ofCO and other GHGs increase,the resulting 2 rise in surface temperature leads to less sea ice and snow cover,causing the planet to absorb more of the sun’s energy rather than reflecting it back to space, thereby raising temperatures even further. Present evidence also suggests that as GHGs lead to rising temperatures, evaporation",

Measurements are from a combination of ice cores (going back 10,000 years) and atmospheric samples in the 20th century. (Source:IPCC 2007, Figure SPM-1, p. 15.

        "Understanding Climate Change 39 increases, leading to more atmospheric water vapor (Soden et al. 2005; Trenberth et al.2005).Additional water vapor,the dominant GHG,acts as a very important feedback to increase temperature further.The most uncer- tain feedback is related to clouds, specifically changes in cloud frequency, location,and height.The range ofuncertainty spans from a significant pos- itive feedback to no feedback,or even a slightly negative feedback.Present understanding suggests that these feedback effects account for at least half of the climate’s warming (IPCC 2001;Karl and Trenberth 2003).The exact magnitude of these effects remains a significant source of uncertainty in understanding the impact of increasing GHGs. Increases in evaporation and water vapor affect global climate in other ways besides causing rising temperatures,such as increasing rainfall and snowfall rates and accelerating drying during droughts. Particles suspended in the atmosphere (aerosols) resulting from human activities can also affect climate.Aerosols vary considerably by region.Some aerosol types (e.g.,sulfate) act in a way opposite to the GHGs by reflecting more solar radiation back to space than the heat they absorb,and thereby causing a negative radiative forcing or cooling ofthe climate system.Other aerosols (e.g.,soot) act in the same way as GHGs and warm the climate.In contrast to the long-lived nature of CO , aerosols are short-lived and 2 removed from the lower atmosphere within a few days.Therefore,human- generated aerosols exert a long-term forcing on climate only because their emissions continue each day of the year.The effects of aerosols on climate can be manifested directly by their ability to reflect and trap heat,but also indirectly by changes in the lifetime of clouds and in the clouds’reflectiv- ity to sunshine. The magnitude of the negative forcing of the indirect effects ofaerosols is highly uncertain,but it may be larger than that oftheir direct effects (IPCC 2001). Emissions of GHGs and aerosols continue to alter the atmosphere by influencing the planet’s natural energy flows (see Box 2-1),which can cause changes in temperature and precipitation extremes, reductions in snow cover and sea ice,changes in storm tracks,and increased intensity of hur- ricanes (IPCC 2007). There are also natural factors that exert a forcing effect on climate [e.g.,changes in the sun’s energy output and short-lived (a few years) aerosols in the stratosphere following episodic and explosive volcanic eruptions].Ifall the possible influences ofnatural and human cli- mate forcings over the past several decades are considered, increases in GHGs have had a larger influence on the planet’s radiation flow than all the",
        "40 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX 2-1 What Warms and Cools the Earth? The sun is the earth’s main energy source. Its output appears nearly constant, but small changes during an extended period of time can lead to climate changes. In addition, slow changes in the earth’s orbit affect how the sun’s energy is distributed across the earth, creating another variable that must be considered. Greenhouse gases warm the earth: Water vapor (H O), supplied from oceans and the natural biosphere, 2 accounts for two-thirds of the total greenhouse effect but acts primarily as a feedback. In contrast to other greenhouse gases, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere generally cannot be controlled by humans. Water vapor introduced directly into the atmosphere from agricultural or other activities does not remain there very long and is overwhelmed by natural sources; thus it has little warming effect. Carbon dioxide (CO ) has natural and human sources. CO levels are 2 2 increasing as a result of the burning of fossil fuels. Methane (CH )has both human and natural sources and has risen signif- 4 icantly since preindustrial times as the result of an increase in several human activities, including raising of livestock; growing of rice; use of landfills; and extraction, handling, and transport of natural gas. Ozone (O ) has natural sources, especially in the stratosphere, where 3 changes caused by ozone-depleting chemicals have been important; ozone also is produced in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmo- sphere) when hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide pollutants react. Nitrous oxide (N O) has been increasing from agricultural and industrial 2 sources. Halocarbons continue to be used as substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as refrigerant fluids, and CFCs from pre–Montreal Protocol usage as refrigerants and as aerosol-package propellants remain in the atmosphere. Scientists have a high level of understanding of the human contributions to climate forcing by carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and CFCs and a medium level of understanding of the human contributions to climate forcing by ozone (Forster et al. 2007).

        "Understanding Climate Change 41 Some aerosols (airborne particles and droplets) warm the earth: Black carbon particles, or “soot,”produced when fossil fuels or vegetation is burned, generally have a warming effect by absorbing solar radiation. Some aerosols cool the earth: Sulfate (SO ) aerosols from burning of fossil fuels reflect sunlight back 4 to space. Volcanic eruptions emit gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO ), which, once in the at- 2 mosphere, forms SO aerosols and ash. Both reflect sunlight back to space. 4 Scientists currently have a low level of understanding of the human contri- butions to climate forcing by aerosols (Forster et al. 2007). Changes in land cover, ice extent, and cloud cover can warm or cool the earth: Deforestationproduces land areas that reflect more sunlight back to space; replacement of tundra by coniferous trees that create dark patches in the snow cover may increase absorption of sunlight. Sea ice reflects sunlight back to space; reduction in the extent of sea ice allows more sunlight to be absorbed into the dark ocean, causing warming. Clouds reflect sunlight back to space but can also act like a greenhouse gas by absorbing heat leaving the earth’s surface; the net effect depends on how the cloud cover changes.

Changes in land use due to urbanization and agricultural practices, although not global,are often most pronounced where people live,work, and grow food and are part of the human impact on climate.

What Is a Climate Model and Why Is It Useful? Many of the scientific laws governing climate change and the processes involved can be quantified and linked by mathematical equations. Fig- ure 2-2 shows schematically the kinds of processes that can be included in climate models. Among them are many earth system components, such as atmospheric chemistry, ocean circulation, sea ice, land surface hydrology,biogeochemistry,2and atmospheric circulation.The physics of many,though not all,of the processes governing climate change are well understood and may be described by mathematical equations. Linking these equations creates mathematical models of climate that may be run on computers or supercomputers. Coupled climate models can include mathematical equations describing physical,chemical,and biogeochem- ical processes and are used because the climate system is composed of different interacting components. Coupled climate models are the preferred approach to climate modeling, but they cannot at present include all details ofthe climate system.One rea- son is that not all details of the climate system are understood,even though the major governing processes are known well enough to allow models to reproduce observed features, including trends, of global climate. Another reason is the prohibitive complexity and run-time requirements of models that might incorporate all known information about the climate system. Decisions on how to build any given climate model include trade-offs among the complexity of the model and the number of earth system components included,the model’s horizontal and spatial resolution,and the number of 1The global effects of these urban heat islands have been analyzed extensively and assessed to ensure that they do not bias measurements of global temperature. 2Biogeochemistry refers to the biological chemistry of the earth system, such as the uptake of atmospheric carbon by land and ocean vegetation.",

Consequently, there is a hierarchy of models of varying complexity, often based on the degree to which approximations are required for each model or component processes omitted. Approximations in climate models represent aspects ofthe models that require parameter choices and “tuning.”As a simple example,imagine rep- resenting a single cumulus cloud in a global climate model.The cloud may encompass only a few hundred meters in vertical and horizontal space—a much finer resolution than can be run on today’s coupled atmosphere and ocean climate models.As a result,ifsuch clouds are to be incorporated into the climate model, some approximations must be made regarding the clouds’statistical properties within, say, an area 100 or 1,000 times larger than the cloud itself.This is referred to as model parameterization,and the process of selecting the most appropriate parameters to best simulate observed conditions is called model tuning. Similar methods are also required in today’s state-of-the-science weather forecasting models. An important difference between weather forecasting models and climate models is that the former are initialized with a specific set of observations representing today’s weather to predict the weather precisely xdays or hours into the future.By contrast,the initial conditions ofclimate models are much less important.Also,climate models are not intended to predict specific future weather events. Rather, they are used to simulate many years of“weather”into the future with the intent of understand- ing the change in the collection of weather events at some point in the future compared with some point in the past (often the climate of the past 30 years or so). Scientists are thus interested in properties of climate,such as average rainfall and temperature and the degree of fluc- tuation about that average.This comparison enables scientists to study the output of climate model simulations to understand the effect of various modifications of those aspects of the climate system that might cause the climate to change. A key challenge in climate modeling is to isolate and identify cause and effect.Doing so requires knowledge about the changes and variations in the external forcings controlling climate and a compre- hensive understanding ofclimate feedbacks (such as a change in the earth’s reflectivity because ofa change in the amount ofsea ice or clouds) and nat- ural climate variability.A related key challenge in climate modeling is the representation of sub-grid-scale processes, such as in some storms, and land-terrain effects.",
        "Understanding Climate Change 45 Model simulations of climate over specified periods can be verified and validated against the observational record. Likewise, model parame- terization schemes for particular processes of interest can be tested by comparison with observations and with higher-resolution, smaller-scale models. Models that describe climate variability and change well can be used as a tool to increase understanding of the climate system.Once eval- uated and validated, climate models can then be used for predictive purposes.Given specific forcing scenarios,the models can provide viable projections offuture climate.In fact,climate models have become the pri- mary means of projecting climate change, although ultimately, future projections are likely to be determined through a variety ofmeans,includ- ing the observed rate of global climate change. How Do We Know the Global Air Temperature Is Increasing? A comprehensive analysis of changes in temperatures near the earth’s sur- face and throughout much ofthe atmosphere is presented in the April 2006 CCSP Synthesis and Assessment Report 1.1 (Karl et al.2006).This report addresses the nagging issue of differences in the rate of warming between measurements derived near the surface (typically 2 m above the surface) and those taken from higher in the atmosphere (i.e.,the lower troposphere, or the atmosphere below roughly 12 km).The surface air temperatures are derived from several different analysis teams,using various combinations of ocean ships and buoys, land observations from weather reporting sta- tions,and satellite data.Atmospheric data sets have been derived by using satellites,weather balloons,and a combination of the two. Considering all the latest satellite, balloon, and surface records, the CCSP report concludes that there is no significant discrepancy between the rates of global temperature change over the past several decades at the surface compared with those higher in the atmosphere. The report does acknowledge, however, that there are still uncertainties in the tropics, related primarily to the data obtained from weather balloons.Many devel- oping countries are struggling to launch weather balloons routinely and process their measurements,and it is unclear whether scientists have been able to adjust adequately for known biases and errors in the data. Globally, data indicate that rates of temperature change have been similar throughout the atmosphere since 1979, when satellite data were first available,and that the rates ofchange have been slightly greater in the",

Instrumental temperature measurements are not the only evidence for increasing global temperatures.The observed increased melting of glaciers can be used to estimate the rate of temperature increase since the late 19th century.Estimates ofnear-surface temperature based on glacial melting are very similar to estimates based on instrumental temperature data.A 15 to 20 percent reduction in Arctic sea ice since the 1970s,a 10 percent decrease in snow cover since the 1970s,and shortened periods of lake and river ice cover (about 2 weeks shorter since the 19th century) have been observed. Also, ocean heat content has significantly increased over the past several decades (IPCC 2007).

        "Understanding Climate Change 47 Why Do Scientists Think Humans Are Influencing the Earth’s Climate? Since the 1980s, the scientific community has been actively working on detecting climate change and determining how much of the change is attributable to human activities.As described above,one set of tools often used for detection and attribution is mathematical computer models ofthe climate.Outstanding issues in modeling include specifying forcing mecha- nisms (e.g.,the causes ofclimate variability and change) within the climate system; addressing complex GHG feedback processes (e.g., methane and carbon) and properly dealing with indirect aerosol forcings and complex physical feedback processes (e.g.,energy and water sources); and improv- ing simulations of regional weather, especially extreme events. Today’s inadequate or incomplete measurements of the various forcing mecha- nisms,with the exception of well-mixed GHGs,add uncertainty when one is trying to simulate past and present climate. Confidence in predicting future climate depends on using climate models to attribute past and pres- ent climate changes to specific causes. Despite these issues, a substantial and growing body of evidence (IPCC 2007) shows that climate models are useful tools for understanding the factors leading to climate change. Recent CO emission trends are upward,with increases of0.5 to 1 per- 2 cent per year over the past few decades.Concentrations of both reflective and nonreflective aerosols are also estimated to be increasing.Net positive radiative forcings3 from GHGs dominate the net cooling forcings from aerosols,and the global temperature change over the past 25 to 30 years has exceeded the bounds of natural variability estimated from climate simula- tions with no human-caused changes. This has been the case since about 1980.As an example ofhow models are used to detect human influence on the climate system,Figure 2-4shows that,without including all the known forcing mechanisms (natural and human or anthropogenic), the models cannot replicate observed global temperature changes. Moreover, many aspects of the climate system other than global surface temperatures have been tested for human influences. 3Radiative forcing can be thought of as the change in heat flow [expressed in watts per square meter (W/m2)] at the tropopause due to an internal change or a change in the external forcing of the climate system, such as a change in the concentration of CO or the output of the sun. The 2 tropopause is the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere, represented by a rather abrupt change from decreasing to increasing temperature with height.",

Thus, there is high confidence that the observed warming, espe- cially during the period since the 1970s, is due mainly to human-caused increases in GHGs (Allen 2005;Gillett et al.2002;Hegerl et al.2001;IPCC 2007; Karl et al. 2006; Karoly and Wu 2005; Stone and Allen 2005; Stott et al.2001;Tett et al.2002;Zhang et al.2006;Zwiers and Zhang 2003).How climate warming will be manifested over the next 50 to 100 years and which factors will have the greatest potential impact on transportation are discussed in the following section. CLIMATE CHANGES RELEVANT TO U.S. TRANSPORTATION Climate variability and change impact transportation mainly through changes in weather extremes,such as very hot days,very cold days,or severe storms;changes in climate extremes,5such as increases in the probability of intense precipitation events and extended droughts;and sea level rise.The U.S. transportation system was built for the typical weather and climate experienced locally,including a reasonable range ofextremes,such as flood- ing events occurring as rarely as once in 100 years.Moderate changes in the mean climate have little impact on transportation infrastructure or opera- tions because the system is designed to accommodate changing weather conditions.However,changes in weather and climate extremes can have a considerable impact on transportation, especially if they push environ- mental conditions outside the range for which the system was designed. Weather and climate extremes of relevance to transportation have been changing over the past several decades and are projected to continue to change in the future,with both negative and positive effects on the trans- portation system. Table 2-1 lists the potential climate changes of greatest relevance for transportation, including the level of uncertainty associated with each. The following subsections address these changes in turn,largely summa- rizing the findings of a paper commissioned for this study (by Peterson 5The exact threshold for what is classified as an extreme varies from one analysis to another, but an extreme event would normally be as rare as, or rarer than, the top or bottom 10 percent of all occurrences (CCSP 2007).

Note that the discussion generally progresses from those climate changes about which there is most certainty to those about which there is less. Changes in Temperature An increase in air temperature allows more water vapor in the atmosphere, which defines the upper bounds of the amount of precipitation that can occur during short-term (e.g.,hourly to 1-day) extreme precipitation events. Surface moisture,ifavailable (as it always is over the oceans),effectively acts as the “air conditioner”ofthe surface,as heat used for evaporation moistens rather than warms the air.Therefore,another consequence of global heat- ing of the lower troposphere is accelerated land-surface drying and more",
        "Understanding Climate Change 51 atmospheric water vapor (the dominant GHG).Human-induced warming has been linked to the water vapor increases in both surface observations (Willett et al.2007) and satellite observations over the oceans (Santer et al. 2007).Without an increase in precipitation,accelerated drying increases the incidence and severity of droughts (Dai et al. 2004), whereas additional atmospheric water vapor increases the risk of heavy precipitation events (Trenberth et al. 2003). Increases in global temperature also cause sea surface temperatures to rise, one of several important factors affecting hurricane intensity. Changes in Temperature Including Extremes U.S.temperatures have been rising over the past century,with more rapid increases since 1970 than earlier,as shown in Figure 2-5.It is unlikely that North American temperature changes since 1950 are due to natural cli- mate variability alone (Karoly et al. 2003).

These warming trends are projected to continue over the next cen- tury on the basis of reasonable scenarios for future GHG emissions. Figure 2-6 shows the temperatures projected for the eastern United States for three different scenarios, each scenario having been run by multiple models. Other areas of the United States show similar warm- ing trends [see Figure 6 in the commissioned paper by Peterson et al.2006 (Appendix C)]. It is interesting to note that for the next 30 years, the uncertainties are primarily model related and not due to different emis- sions scenarios. Even if atmospheric concentrations remained at current levels, the models would still project similar warming over the next couple of decades (IPCC 2007).

        "Understanding Climate Change 53 Increases in Very Hot Days and Heat Waves The next century is likely to bring more very hot days and heat waves [see Figure 9 in the paper by Peterson et al.2006 (Appendix C)].The number of days with temperature above 32.2°C (90°F) and 37.7°C (100°F) has been increasing since 1970,but it is not quite as high today as during the early 1950s,when several areas,particularly the south-central United States, had severe droughts.By 2090–2099,it is expected that the average temper- ature on the hottest day of the year will be 2.5°C to 4.5°C (4.5°F to 8.1°F) warmer than the hottest day of the year in the 1990s.Not only will there be hotter and more very hot days, but it is likely that the continental United States will have significantly more heat waves with sustained high temperatures for 5 consecutive days or longer. There are several ways to conceptualize the change in very hot days. For example, the 20-year return value for the hottest day of the year in 2090–2099 can be compared with the same value for the 1990s. The 20-year return value is the temperature that is reached or exceeded on average once every 20 years over a long period oftime.Such temperatures are truly rare events because they are expected to be reached only three or four times during the course of a human lifetime.Over most of the con- tinental United States, the present-day 20-year return value temperatures would be reached or exceeded seven times or more in a 20-year interval by the end of the 21st century. Hence, the rare high-temperature event be- comes commonplace in this scenario. Figure 2-7 depicts another way of considering the change in very hot days expected in the next century,with Dallas, Texas, as an example. The figure shows the probability of having 1 to 20 days during the summer when the temperature exceeds 43.3°C (110°F).The probability increases substantially 25,50,and 90 years in the future. Similar plots are presented for Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Honolulu in the paper by Peterson et al.2006 (see Appendix C). Decreases in Very Cold Days The number of very cold days has been decreasing in the United States since about 1970 (see Figure 2-8).This trend is also expected to continue into the future across the continent.For example,in the Washington,D.C., area, there is currently a 75 percent chance that 3 days each winter will have maximum temperatures at or below freezing.By the end of the cen- tury,this probability is projected to drop to 20 percent.",

In particular, the number of days from the last freeze in the spring to the first freeze in the fall is expected to increase.Figure 2-9shows a corresponding period—the length of time between the first day in the year that the maximum daily temperature reaches 21.1°C (70°F) and the last day of the year when this occurs. This interval has been increasing since 1970 and can be expected to increase further in the future. While there is considerable year-to-year variability in the number offreeze–thaw days (i.e., days when an observation station’s maximum temperature is above freezing and its minimum temperature below freezing),no distinct trend has been observed in this quantity. Changes in Sea Level Sea level is projected to rise over the next century,but there is significant uncertainty as to how much and how fast.

Several analyses have identified a number of factors that as yet have uncertain likelihoods but could easily contribute to nonlinear and abrupt rises in sea level (IPCC 2007; Schoof 2007; Vaughan et al. 2007). Such extrapolations are tentative, however, because the extent to which the trends of the past decade are due to natural variability in the climate sys- tem is unknown. Global warming affects sea level through two mechanisms:thermal expansion of seawater and melting of ice present on land surfaces. Other factors also play a role in sea level, such as the amount of water held back by human-made land reservoirs,leading to sea level falls,but these factors are less important.There are still problems in reconciling the observed changes of the past century with the estimated contribu- tions from these different sources (Munk 2002).Most of the projected sea level rise is due to thermal expansion,but should the melting of the polar ice caps accelerate, sea level would rise much higher. The rapid melting of Greenland, which would have a very large impact, is possi- ble, but too little is known to assess its likelihood (IPCC 2007). Current model projections of sea level rise are based on the observed rate of melting during 1993–2003, but these rates could increase or decrease in the future. More important to transportation than the global change in sea level is the local apparent change in sea level (Burkett 2002; Titus 2002). Estimates of local apparent sea level rise take into account the vertical movement of land and coastal erosion.Coastal erosion,in turn,is driven by sea level rise.To estimate local sea level rise,land subsidence in the Gulf Coast and uplift along the New England coast are important factors (NRC 1987). Figure 2-10 illustrates that because of these factors, different regions can have quite different local sea level rise.

Thus, for a 0.5-m worldwide sea level rise, sandy shores could retreat 75 m.Although the Bruun rule is useful as a conceptual model,rigorous application ofcoastal geology and climatol- ogy models is necessary for risk analysis at specific locations. Exacerbation ofStorm Surge by Sea Level Rise Storm surge is the abnormal rise in sea level accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm,above the level of the normal or astronomic tide. Storm surge can be exacerbated by tidal piling,a phenomenon of abnor- mally high water levels from successive incoming tides that do not completely drain because of strong winds or waves persisting through successive tide cycles.Flooding due to coastal storms results from a com- bination of storm surge and intense precipitation.Storm surge is of great concern to port operations, mooring facilities, and moored vessels, as well as to coastal infrastructure that is vulnerable to flooding. Storm surge has been estimated or modeled by using the United States Army Corps of Engineers’ Waterways Experiment Station model; the National Weather Service’s Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hur- ricanes model; and more recently the Advanced Circulation Model (ADCIRC) (Westerink et al. 1994). These models use wind fields from past storms as input;these historical input data are updated infrequently. When updated, these models show wider areas of 100-year floodplains. For example,a recent analysis with the ADCIRC model using input data through the 2005 hurricane season showed greater storm surge and higher flooding. The magnitude of the 100-year storm surge flood (previously established using data for 1900–1956) would now recur at an interval of 75 years on the basis of data for 1900–2005 (Levinson 2006). Changes in Precipitation Changes in the Intensity ofHeavy and Extreme Precipitation Basic theory and climate model simulations as well as empirical evidence (see Figure 2-11) confirm that warmer climates,owing to increased water vapor,lead to more intense precipitation events even when total precipi- tation remains constant, with prospects for even stronger events when precipitation amounts increase. Figure 2-12 depicts the aggregate land-",

For example, by the end of the 21st century, a conservative projection of climate change has the recurrence period (or average expected waiting time) for the current 1-in-20-year,heaviest daily precipitation event reduc- ing to every 6 to 8 years over much of North America (Kharin et al.2007; Wehner 2005). The practical implications of addressing these changes are seen in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) recent update of the Ohio River Basin’s 100-year daily precipitation return period. These data are used to help set engineering design standards related to excessive rainfall.Over the past several decades,increases in the amount of precipitation occurring during the heaviest daily precipitation events have been observed in many areas ofthe central and eastern United States (Groisman et al.2004;Groisman et al.2005;Karl and Knight 1998). In fact, over the 20th century, annual precipitation averaged across the United States increased by about 7 percent,but very intense precipitation events (above the 95th percentile) increased by nearly three times that rate (20 percent).The observed behavior supports one of the most con- fident projections that scientists can make about future precipitation. Considerable analysis has shown that because water vapor has increased in the atmosphere and will continue to do so with added anthropogenic GHG emissions,the intensity of precipitation will continue to increase in much of the United States (and elsewhere).In many regions of the world, increases in extreme precipitation are occurring even when total precipi- tation is relatively constant (Alpert et al. 2002; Groisman et al. 2003; Groisman et al.2005).In areas where overall precipitation increases,the increase in the intensity of very heavy precipitation events will be even greater. There are several different ways to think about how the increase in the intensity of heavy and extreme precipitation events might be manifested. One option is to consider changes in a 20-year return event. In the A1b emissions scenario,the present-day 20-year precipitation event would take place 2 to 4 times as frequently by the end ofthe 21st century [see Figure 27c and text in Peterson et al.2006 (Appendix C) for an explanation ofthe emis- sions scenarios].Another useful measure is the Simple Daily Intensity Index, which equals the total annual precipitation divided by the number ofdays with precipitation in that year.Figure 2-13a shows that this quantity has increased over the United States,indicating that on days that precipitation",

Median model projections for the future over the continental United States (Figure 2-13b) indicate that the Simple Daily Intensity Index is expected to continue to increase over the next century. Changes in the Severity and Frequency ofDrought Drought is a recurring feature of the climate system;major droughts have occurred in the past and are expected in the future.At any given time, at least part ofthe United States is in drought,with proportions ranging from 5 to 80 percent of the nation’s total land area. U.S. droughts show pro- nounced multiyear to multidecadal variability,but there is no convincing evidence for systematic long-term trends toward more or fewer events. Drought calculations have shown that over the United States,the increase in temperatures that may have led to increased evaporation has been com- pensated by a general increase in precipitation during the past few decades (Dai et al. 2004), with the result that there has been no general trend in drought intensity nationwide (Figure 2-14).Over the United States,climate model projections of precipitation change by the end of the 21st century show a tendency for increasing winter precipitation and decreasing sum- mer precipitation as global temperatures increase. Locations that do experience decreased precipitation in addition to the continuing increase in temperatures,such as the recently observed record-high January–June of 2006 (NOAA 2006), could have greater drought severity and frequency, especially during periods of dry weather due to increases in evaporation. Long-term warming trends have already led to changes in the timing of snowmelt and stream flows,especially in the West,resulting in earlier peak stream flows and diminished summertime flows. For the continental United States, the most extensive drought in the modern observational record occurred from 1933 to 1938. In July 1934, 80 percent ofthe United States was gripped by moderate or greater drought (see Figure 2-14), and 63 percent was experiencing severe to extreme drought.During 1953–1957,severe drought covered up to 50 percent ofthe country.Paleoclimatic data (e.g.,tree ring measurements) have been used to reconstruct drought patterns for the period prior to the modern instru- mental record (Cook et al.1999; Cook et al.2004).These reconstructions show that during most of the past two millennia,the climate of the west- ern United States has been more arid than at present.

One of the more robust findings of the IPCC (2007) relates to recent agreement among virtually all climate model simulations ofthe 21st cen- tury that a drying of the southwestern United States is evident. Seager et al. (2007) provide the details and indicate that this drying is attribut- able to both an increase in evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation. Droughts in this part ofthe country that occur naturally,such as those of the past two millennia, would be expected to be enhanced as a result of greenhouse forcing of the climate. Increased temperatures will lead to increased drying during periods of dry weather,leading to more intense droughts in much of the United States. For the southwestern United States,reduced precipitation will add to this effect.",
        "Understanding Climate Change 65 Changes in Storms Changes in Hurricane Intensity and Frequency Tropical storms,particularly hurricanes,are an important issue ofconcern for the United States.The record-breaking hurricane season of 2005,espe- cially the havoc created by Katrina,raised public awareness of the dangers ofhurricanes to new heights.Hurricanes respond to a number ofenviron- mental factors,including ocean temperatures,atmospheric stability,wind changes,El Niño,and others.One important question is whether hurricane activity has changed over the past 100 years.Since 1995,Atlantic hurricane activity has increased substantially, with more and more intense hurri- canes,compared with the previous two decades,and this increased level of activity is also reflected in those hurricanes striking the United States (see Figure 2-15). Earlier periods, however, such as 1945–1970, were nearly as active. FIGURE 2-15 Number of hurricanes striking the United States, 1901–2005, summed by 5-year periods (e.g., 1901–1905, 1906–1910).

        "66 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation An important consideration with regard to hurricane intensity is the trend toward warmer sea surface temperatures,particularly in the tropical Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico,indicating that climate change may play some role in increased hurricane intensity (Emanuel 2005;Webster et al. 2005). Another factor is a slow cycle of natural fluctuations in atmo- spheric conditions and ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic,referred to as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which is currently in a warm ocean temperature phase. What does the future hold for hurricane activity? In the near term,it is expected that favorable conditions for Atlantic hurricanes will persist for the next decade or so on the basis of previously active periods. For the longer term, climate models project an increase in the intensity of strong hurricanes in the 21st century (Bengtsson et al.2007;McDonald et al.2005; Oouchi et al.2006;Sugi et al.2002).Specifically,this translates to increases in wind speed and about a half-category increase in intensity on the com- monly used Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Intensity Scale as tropical sea surface temperatures increase by nearly 2°C. Given these conditions (stronger hurricanes and warmer tropical sea surface temperatures), climate mod- els also predict an increase in storm rainfall rates of about 20 percent (T.R. Knutson, personal communication, 2006). No robust projections concerning the annual global number of tropical storms have yet emerged from modeling studies,but more detailed analyses focused on the Atlantic Ocean suggest no significant increases in the annual number of Atlantic tropical storms (CCSP 2007).Many relevant factors,such as future changes in wind field patterns,remain very difficult to predict. Extratropical Storms The IPCC AR4 models projected a reduction in the total number of mid- latitude cyclones and an increase in the number of intense storms.This is a robust result, yielded by essentially all the models (Lambert and Fyfe 2006).Associated with these changes is an increase in ocean wave height in the northeastern Atlantic and the northern Pacific (Wang et al.2004). Analysis of the conditions that cause thunderstorm systems in the United States to produce hail results in a time series fairly similar to the U.S.tem- perature time series shown in Figure 2-5, decreasing from 1950 to the 1970s and then increasing (Brooks and Dotzek 2008). Projecting these conditions into the future is difficult because contemporary climate mod- els lack sufficient resolution to simulate these storms directly.",
        "Understanding Climate Change 67 Visibility Some ofthe climate changes discussed earlier in this chapter may have sec- ondary effects.Visibility is one such effect.For example,if the number of intense extratropical storms increases,they may be accompanied by more time with low visibility during heavy snowfall events (Rasmussen et al. 1999).Projections of drying in the interior of continents would imply the possibility of increases in blowing dust. The risk of forest wildfires in the American West is strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring melt (Westerling et al.2006) as well as possible biomass increases from increased precipitation (e.g.,Bachelet et al. 2001;Lenihan et al.2003).These are exactly the conditions being projected by models for the future.Therefore,wildfire-induced decreases in visibility are likely to become more frequent.It is uncertain from a theoretical stand- point how the occurrence of fog might change in a warming climate. Therefore,while the number oflow-visibility events associated with intense storms and fires might be projected to increase,it is uncertain whether the total number of occurrences of low visibility would increase, decrease, or remain the same in the projected climate of the future. Transportation is significantly affected when visibility drops to less than about 400 m (0.25 mi).Times with such low visibility are associated primarily with fog, heavy precipitation, blowing sand or snow, or smoke from wildfires. Observations of past trends in visibility and models of changes projected for the future are not currently available.While visibil- ity is observed at airports throughout the United States, changes in observing practices over the past decades make it inappropriate to exam- ine long-term changes in low visibility without a major effort to assess the data’s homogeneity. Climate Considerations Related to Alaska The Alaskan Arctic and sub-Arctic are recognized as the area of the world where changes to the climate are likely to be among the greatest,leading to significant impacts.In addition,the area has always experienced great natu- ral climatic variability.Because the climate changes in Alaska are so distinct from those in the rest of the United States, this section is devoted to an examination of these expected changes as they relate to transportation. Climate variables ofparticular relevance to the transportation sector in Alaska include (a) the extent of sea ice, snow cover, and permafrost, all",
        "68 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation directly driven by temperature change and to some extent by atmospheric and oceanic circulation;(b) storminess as related to wave height and storm surges;(c) precipitation and related snow and ice cover;and (d) sea level as related to land ice,ocean temperature,and movement of the land relative to the ocean due to geologic features and glacial rebound of the land as land ice melts. Generally, the extent of sea ice is important because the ice dampens the energy of ocean waves. Wave energy is dependent on the distance traveled by the wind over open water. Less extensive sea ice exposes the coastline to more frequent and potentially higher ocean waves and swells. Temperature drives the extent of sea ice, but changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation also play an important role in multiyear variations in the extent and location of sea ice.Changes in the type,amount,and intensity of precipitation,as well as the extent of snow and ice cover,can also con- tribute to coastal erosion from stream flow and overland runoff to the sea. Loss of permafrost along coasts can lead to subsidence of the land,which occurs when ice beneath the sea and along the shoreline melts.Alaska has considerable permafrost along its northern and western coasts.The height ofthe sea relative to the land is the ultimate long-term driver ofcoastal ero- sion,but Alaskan sea level rise is complicated by both climatic factors and geologic forces, affecting local and regional changes in the height of the land relative to the ocean. Atmospheric Temperature Temperatures in Alaska have increased. Observational data indicate that Alaskan spring and summer surface temperatures have increased by about 2°C to 3°C (about 4°F to 5°F) in the past few decades.However,there are no discernible trends in temperature during autumn,and changes in win- ter temperature are more complex. There were two 5-year periods in the first half of the 20th century when temperatures were nearly as warm as today,but record-breaking high temperatures have become more common during recent decades. Most climate model projections for temperature change during the 21st century suggest that Alaska, and the Arctic as a whole, will warm at least twice as much as the rest of the world.The warming is expected to be greatest during the cold halfofthe year.The observed lack ofwarming dur- ing the autumn and the relatively large increases during other times of the year are not entirely consistent with model projections;they do not depict this asymmetry.",
        "Understanding Climate Change 69 As temperatures increase and sea ice continues to melt,a natural cli- mate feedback occurs as a result ofless reflection ofsunlight by the ocean formerly covered by sea ice.This feedback can lead to accelerated warm- ing and additional sea ice melting.At present,the rate ofloss ofNorthern Hemisphere sea ice is exceeding climate model projections, and at the present rate of loss, summer sea ice will be absent before the middle of this century.Climate models do project an acceleration of sea ice retreat over the 21st century,with periods of extensive melting lasting progres- sively further into spring and fall.All climate models project this trend to continue regardless of the emission scenario used and the sensitivity of the model. Large portions of Northern Hemisphere sea ice form during the cold seasons and melt during the warm seasons. Considerable sea ice persists through the melt season, but because of ocean circulation and the resultant ice movement, multiyear sea ice makes up only a fraction of the total ice extent. Records indicate that the formation of new sea ice each year cannot keep pace with the rate of melting, which is con- sistent with observed surface warming. Northern Hemisphere sea ice has been decreasing steadily since the 1950s, measured largely through continuous coverage provided by NOAA polar orbiting satellites begin- ning in the 1970s.Prior to that time,assessment ofthe extent ofNorthern Hemisphere sea ice during the first half of the 20th century was limited to reports from land stations and ocean surface observations.Scientists have less confidence in the data for the first part of the century, but independent anecdotal evidence,such as interviews with native peoples of Alaska, also suggests substantially greater extent of sea ice earlier in the century. It is important to understand trends in the extent of coastal sea ice because it is an important determinant ofwave energy affecting coastlines. As the storms that create wave energy also exhibit strong seasonal varia- tion,it is important to know how sea ice is changing by season.Since the 1950s,the extent of sea ice during winter and autumn has decreased from 15 million square kilometers (km2) to 14 million km2and from 12 million km2to 11 million km2,respectively.Since the 1950s,decreases in spring and summer have been substantially greater,down from an average of 15 mil- lion km2to 12 million km2and 11 million km2to 8 million km2,respectively. This is equivalent to more than 10 percent ofthe North American land mass and is an area larger than the state ofAlaska.",
        "70 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Extratropical Storms The climatology of Pacific Ocean storms favors the development of the strongest storms (extratropical cyclones) from autumn to spring.Although there are remaining uncertainties about the quality of the data,analyses of Pacific Ocean extratropical cyclones over the past 50 years indicate little change in the total number but a significant increase in the number of intense storms (those with low central pressure and resultant high winds and waves).The increase in extratropical storms is punctuated by consid- erable year-to-year variability. Both observational evidence and modeling projections support the notion that as the world warms, the intensity of cyclones in the northern Pacific (and the northern Atlantic) will increase (e.g.,Lambert and Fyfe 2006;Wang et al.2006). Even without an increase in storm intensity,the greater expanse ofopen water due to less extensive sea ice means that ocean waves, with resultant coastal erosion,can occur more frequently and with greater impact. Precipitation and Extent ofSnow Cover One ofthe most difficult quantities to measure across the state ofAlaska is precipitation. This is the case because of the variable nature of precipita- tion in general,the relatively low number of observing stations across the state,and the difficulty of providing high-quality data in the harsh Arctic environment. The large uncertainty in estimated precipitation trends is also due to the difficulty of measuring wind-blown solid precipitation. On the basis of existing records,however,there is evidence to indicate that during the past 40 years,as temperatures have warmed,more pre- cipitation has been falling in liquid form (rain) as opposed to solid form (snow, ice). The quantity of precipitation also increased during the 20th century,with much of that increase occurring during the recent period of warming over the past 40 years.The increase is estimated to be between 10 and 20 percent,with most of it occurring during the summer and winter rather than during the transition seasons. Because of greater overall precipitation in the summer,the percent increase in summer equates to a greater quantity of precipitation compared with winter. Analyses ofchanges in intense precipitation events have been conducted for areas south of 62°N latitude. They show that the frequency of intense precipitation events has increased substantially (30 to 40 percent) during the past several decades.Thus,a disproportionate amount of the precipita- tion increase is attributable to the most intense precipitation events.",
        "Understanding Climate Change 71 Climate models project that precipitation will increase by a greater proportion in the high latitudes compared with the rest ofthe world.This result is consistent from model to model,as is the fact that this increase is expected to be disproportionately larger in the more intense precipitation events.Both of these phenomena can lead to increased erosion. NOAA’s polar-orbiting environmental satellite data and surface-based observations have also revealed major changes in the extent ofsnow cover. The extent of North American snow cover has decreased by about 1 mil- lion km2, and this trend is expected to continue or accelerate. Surface observers also report a 1- to 2-week reduction in the number of days with snow on the ground across the state.In addition,in the Arctic,the lake and river ice season is now estimated to be 12 days shorter than in the 19th century. The increase in total and liquid precipitation, especially when falling on less extensive snow cover,can affect soil erosion.However,the complex effects of changes in precipitation type and intensity, earlier breakup of winter ice,and less extensive snow cover have not been well evaluated with respect to potential impacts on coastal erosion and flooding.It will be nec- essary to know which factor dominates in order to understand whether coastal erosion and flooding will be enhanced or ameliorated as a result of changes in the extent of precipitation and snow cover. Permafrost Thawing ofthe permafrost,especially along the northern coasts,is expected to continue. Long-term measurements of temperatures within the per- mafrost are rare, but it is clear that as air and ocean temperatures have warmed, permafrost has been melting. As permafrost melts along the coastlines,the effect on coastal erosion can be compounded by the retreat of sea ice. The thaw causes the land to subside along the shore, expos- ing more land to the action of the waves.The thaw also causes slumping and landslides in the interior, undermining structures built on or near permafrost. Sea Level A general increase in sea level would expose more land to coastal erosion through wave energy and storm surges. However, it is important to rec- ognize that there are many local and regional variations in sea level rise, and Alaska is no exception in this regard.Complications arise because of",
        "72 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation geologic forces; the rebound of the land as glaciers melt; and in some areas,local engineering projects.For certain areas in Alaska (e.g.,parts of southeast Alaska),sea level is actually falling as a result ofnatural geologic and glacial rebound effects, but this is generally not the case in much of the state. It is clear, however, that changes in Alaskan climate are among the greatest in the world. They have likely played an important role in determining the extent ofcoastal erosion and flooding in the state and are likely to continue to do so in the future.Accelerated coastal erosion and flooding linked to sea level rise in Alaska cannot be ruled out. FINDINGS The state of the science continues to indicate that modern climate change is affected by human influences, primarily human-induced changes in atmospheric composition that are warming the climate. These changes result mainly from emissions of GHGs associated with energy use,but on local and regional scales, urbanization and land use changes are also important contributors to climate change.Once in the atmosphere,GHG concentrations have a long residence time—on the order of a century. Thus,they would continue to affect climate conditions even ifGHG emis- sions were eliminated today,and they demand a response. Substantial progress has been made in monitoring and understanding the causes of climate change, but scientific, technical, and institutional challenges to improving projections of future climate change remain. For example,considerable uncertainty persists about the rates of climate change that can be expected during the 21st century.Nevertheless,it is clear that climate change will be increasingly manifested in important and tan- gible ways,such as changes in extremes of temperature and precipitation, decreases in seasonal and perennial snow and ice extent,and rising sea lev- els. In addition, climate models project an increase in the intensity of strong hurricanes, with an increase in related storm rainfall rates, in the 21st century.Thus,as human-induced climate changes are superimposed on the natural variability of the climate,the future will include new classes of weather and climate extremes not experienced in modern times. Climate changes will affect transportation largely through these extremes.The U.S.transportation system was built for the typical weather and climate experienced locally,including a reasonable range of extremes. If projected climate changes push environmental conditions outside the range for which the system was designed—and the scientific evidence sug-",
        "Understanding Climate Change 73 gests that this will be the case—the impacts will be significant. They will vary by mode of transportation and region of the country,and some will be positive;in general,however,the impacts will be widespread and costly in both human and economic terms and require significant changes in the planning,design,construction,operation,and maintenance oftransporta- tion systems. In the next chapter, the likely impacts of projected climate changes on transportation are examined in detail.

        "3 Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation T his chapter explores what is known about the potential impacts of climate change on transportation.First,the vulnerability ofthe trans- portation system to climate change is considered,recognizing,however,that not all changes will have negative impacts. Then, the potential impacts of the major climate change factors of relevance for U.S.transportation iden- tified in the previous chapter are described for each transportation mode. Next, the few studies that have actually assessed the impacts of climate change on transportation in a particular region or metropolitan area are reviewed;these studies provide a good illustration ofregional differences in both expected climate changes and impacts.The chapter ends with the com- mittee’s findings on the impacts of climate change on transportation. VULNERABILITY OF THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM TO CLIMATE CHANGE No comprehensive inventory exists of U.S. transportation infrastructure vulnerable to climate change impacts,the potential extent ofthat exposure, or the potential damage costs.Nevertheless,some salient data can be pieced together from various sources.For example,53 percent ofthe U.S.popula- tion lives in counties with coastal areas,although such areas make up only 17 percent of the nation’s contiguous land area (Crossett et al. 2004; U.S. Census Bureau 2005,28).1 Population density in coastal counties (exclud- 1Coastal areas are defined by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as counties and equivalent areas with at least 15 percent of their land area either in a coastal watershed or in a coastal area between watersheds. 79",

This population swells in the summer months, as beaches are the top tourist destination (Douglass et al.2005).Coastal areas are projected to experience continued development pressures as both retirement magnets and tourist destinations. For example, many of the most populous coastal counties located in California, south Florida, and Texas (Harris County),which already experience the effects of hurricanes and other tropical storms, are expected to grow rapidly in the coming decades (Crossett et al.2004).This growth will generate demand for more transportation infrastructure and increase the difficulty of evacuation in an emergency. Sea level rise, which climate scientists now believe to be virtually cer- tain,in combination with expected population growth,will aggravate the situation, making housing and infrastructure in low-lying coastal areas even more vulnerable to extensive flooding and higher storm surges. An estimated 60,000 miles of coastal highways is already exposed to periodic coastal storm flooding and wave action (Douglass et al.2005).2Those high- ways that currently serve as evacuation routes during hurricanes and other coastal storms could be compromised in the future.Although coastal high- way mileage is a small fraction ofthe nearly 4 million miles ofpublic roads in the United States,the vulnerability of these highways is concentrated in a few states,and some ofthese routes also serve as barriers to sea intrusion and as evacuation routes (Titus 2002). Coastal areas are also major centers of economic activity. Six of the nation’s top 10 U.S.freight gateways (by value of shipments) (BTS 2007) will be at risk from sea level rise (see Table 3-1). Seven of the 10 largest ports (by tons of traffic) (BTS 2007, 30) are located in the Gulf Coast, whose vulnerability was amply demonstrated during the 2005 tropical storm season.3 The Gulf Coast is also home to the U.S.oil and gas indus- tries,providing nearly 30 percent ofthe nation’s crude oil production and 2These estimates were made by using geographic information systems to measure the length of roads in coastal counties, superimposing data from the Flood Insurance Rate Maps of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to indicate those roads along the coast or tidal rivers likely to be inundated by storm surge in a 100-year storm, and finally adjusting the estimate to eliminate flooding from rainfall runoff. 3The Port of South Louisiana is the nation’s largest port by tonnage and the largest agricultural export facility in the United States (Mineta 2005). Fortunately, it suffered only minor structural damage from Hurricane Katrina.",

Several thousand off-shore drilling platforms,dozens of refineries,and thousands of miles of pipelines are vulnerable to disruption and dam- age from storm surge and high winds of tropical storms,as was recently demonstrated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.Those hurricanes halted all oil and gas production from the Gulf, disrupted nearly 20 percent of the nation’s refinery capacity, and closed oil and gas pipelines (CBO 2006).4 Climate scientists believe that global warming is likely to increase the inten- sity of strong hurricanes making landfall,increasing the risk of damage to or lengthening the disruption in the operation of these vital facilities. Inland areas are also likely to experience the effects of climate change. Increased intense precipitation predicted by climate scientists for the con- tinental United States could increase the severity ofsuch events as the great flood of 1993.That event caused catastrophic flooding along 500 miles of the Mississippi and Missouri River system, paralyzing surface transporta- tion systems, including rail, truck, and marine traffic. Major east–west traffic was halted for roughly 6 weeks in an area stretching from St.Louis 4By the end of 2005—4 months after Hurricane Katrina and a little more than 3 months after Hurricane Rita—roughly one-quarter of crude oil production and one-fifth of natural gas production from the Gulf remained shut down (CBO 2006). Two percent of the nation’s refinery capacity still was not operating.",
        "82 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation west to Kansas City and north to Chicago,affecting one-quarter of all U.S. freight that either originated or terminated in the flood-affected region (Changnon 1996).Drier conditions are likely to prevail in the summer in midcontinental regions, such as the Saint Lawrence Seaway.Weather and vessel incidents cause most of the lock downtime on the seaway, but in 2000 and 2001,water levels were at their lowest point in 35 years,reducing vessel carrying capacity to about 90 percent of normal (BTS 2005,140).If low water levels become more common because ofdryer conditions due to climate change, freight movements in the region could be seriously impaired,and extensive dredging could be required to keep shipping chan- nels open (Great Lakes Regional Assessment Team 2000; Quinn 2002).A longer shipping season afforded by a warmer climate,however,could off- set some of the resulting adverse economic effects. The vulnerability of transportation infrastructure to climate change is in part a function ofits robustness and degree ofprotection from exposure to climate change effects (as is the case,for example,with seawalls and lev- ees).It also depends on the amount of redundancy in the system.Box 3-1 illustrates how system redundancies proved critical to the rapid restora- tion of partial rail service during both Hurricane Katrina and the 1993 Mississippi River flood.5 Yet the predominant trend has been for the rail- roads (as well as other owners of infrastructure) to shed uneconomical unused capacity by consolidating operations and abandoning underused lines. Likewise, major businesses, both manufacturing and retail, have reduced operating costs through just-in-time delivery strategies, but with the effect of increasing their vulnerability to disruptions or failures of the transportation system from either natural or human causes. The network character of the transportation system can help mitigate the negative economic consequences ofa shock to the system,particularly in the longer term, as shipments can be shifted to alternative modes or other regions can pick up the interrupted service.To illustrate,the Port of Gulfport, Mississippi, which was competing with New Orleans to be the second-largest container port in the Gulf,was 95 percent destroyed by the 30-foot storm surge from Hurricane Katrina (Plume 2005).Subsequently, much ofthe traffic shifted to other ports while Gulfport undertook major reconstruction of its facilities. On the other hand, the network character 5See also the discussion later in this chapter of the results of a case study of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita commissioned for this study.",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 83 BOX 3-1 Examples of the Role of System Redundancies in the Restoration of Critical Infrastructure Following Natural Disasters Hurricane Katrina significantly damaged rail transport in the Gulf Coast region, particularly east–west traffic through the New Orleans interchange rail gateway—one of only four major rail crossings of the Mississippi River. CSX was the rail carrier most affected, sustaining significant damage to two-thirds of its track mileage between Mobile and New Orleans and to five railroad bridges between Biloxi and New Orleans (M. Hinsdale, presenta- tion to the committee, Jan. 5, 2006). Estimated reconstruction costs were approximately $300 million, or about one-quarter of CSX’s annual operat- ing revenues available for capital investment. Nevertheless, CSX coped with the situation by using “borrowed” track of other, less hard-hit railroads in the region and by rerouting freight as far north as the St. Louis Mississippi River crossing. CSX has committed to rebuilding its coastal track in the short term but is evaluating less vulnerable alternative routes using exist- ing rail corridors or constructing farther inland. At the time, the flood of 1993 was hailed as the worst natural disaster ever experienced by the U.S. railroad industry. Total physical damages amounted to more than $282 million in 2005 dollars—23 percent of which included costs to operate detoured trains (Changnon 2006). In addi- tion, because of the delays, the railroads lost revenues of $198 million. Nevertheless, nearly 3,000 long-distance trains were rerouted onto other railroad lines and some little-used lines bordering on abandonment. System redundancies and operating arrangements with other carriers enabled the affected railroads to continue operating—more slowly and at increased cost— but operating nonetheless. of the transportation system can work to magnify the effects of a shock to the system,particularly when critical links are damaged or destroyed.This situation was well illustrated during Hurricane Katrina with the loss of critical highway and rail bridges. POTENTIAL IMPACTS BY TRANSPORTATION MODE The impacts ofclimate change on transportation infrastructure will differ depending on the particular mode of transportation,its geographic loca-",
        "84 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation tion, and its condition. This section is focused on those climate changes and weather parameters identified in the previous chapter (see Table 2-1) that climate scientists agree are most likely to occur over the course ofthis century and are of greatest relevance to transportation.Potential impacts on all modes of transport—land, marine, and aviation—are considered. However, the discussion is intended to be illustrative rather than com- prehensive in coverage, highlighting major impacts, similarities and differences among modes,and implications for adaptation strategies. Annex 3-1 gives the relevant climate and weather parameters along with potential impacts by transportation mode. In preparing this table, the committee drew on past efforts to identify transportation-sensitive weather conditions, as well as the collective expertise of the committee members.Some notable past reports include the Weather Information for Surface Transportation National Needs Assessment Report (OFCM 2002), the Metropolitan East Coast Assessment (Gornitz and Couch 2000; see detail in the next section), the U.S. Department of Transportation Workshop on Transportation and Climate Change (USDOT 2002),and an article by Black (1990). In addition, the discussion in this section draws heavily on a paper commissioned for this study (Peterson et al. 2006; see Appendix C) that provides a more detailed discussion of the potential impacts of climate change on transportation on the basis of recent global climate simulations. The primary focus here is on the direct impacts of potential climate changes on transportation infrastructure. Nevertheless, many of these effects will be influenced by the environment in which the infrastructure is located.For example,increased precipitation levels in some regions will affect moisture levels in the soil and hydrostatic buildup behind retaining walls and abutments and the stability of pavement subgrades. Runoff from increased precipitation levels will also affect stream flow and sedi- ment delivery in some locations,with potentially adverse effects on bridge foundations.Permafrost decline will affect Arctic land forms and hydrol- ogy,with potentially adverse effects on the stability of road- and rail beds. And sea level rise will affect coastal land forms, exposing many coastal areas to storm surge as barrier islands and other natural barriers dis- appear. Such changes are noted here, but their variability from region to region prohibits further elaboration. There are also likely to be many indirect effects of potential climate changes on transportation. For example, possible climate-caused shifts in",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 85 demographics or in the distribution ofagricultural production,forests,and fisheries would have implications for road usage and other transport pat- terns between emerging economic centers and urban areas.Transportation patterns could also shift as the tourism industry responds to changes in eco- logically or recreationally interesting destinations.Similarly,climate changes elsewhere in the world that shift markets or demographics could affect the U.S.transportation system. Other indirect effects may be manifested at the interface between mit- igation and adaptation.Likely U.S.regulation of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency will affect transportation activities,potentially shifting travel to more energy-efficient modes (see Appendix B). Furthermore, climate changes may present additional challenges to meeting air and water quality standards. For example, warmer summertime temperatures will exacerbate air pollution,partic- ularly ground-level ozone, likely requiring further action to mitigate transportation-related emissions of pollutants. Similarly, changes in runoff resulting from modified precipitation regimes could affect water quality,with implications for roadway treatments. Impacts of Warming Temperatures and Temperature Extremes Land Transportation Modes Land transportation modes comprise highways (including bridges and tunnels); rail (including private rail lines and public transportation); the vehicles that use these facilities—passenger cars,trucks,buses,rail and rail transit cars—and pipelines (recognizing that the latter are buried under- ground in many areas). Projected warming temperatures and more heat extremes will affect all of these modes (see Annex 3-1).The effects of temperature warming are already being experienced in Alaska in the form of continued retreat of permafrost regions (see the discussion of Alaska below),creating land subsidence issues for some sections of the road and rail systems and for some of the elevated supports for aboveground sections of the Trans- Alaska pipeline. Warming winter temperatures have also shortened the season for ice roads that provide vital access to communities and indus- trial activities in remote areas.

In many northern states, for example, warming winter temperatures will bring about reductions in snow and ice removal costs, lessen adverse environmental impacts from the use of salt and chemicals on roads and bridges, extend the construc- tion season,and improve the mobility and safety of passenger and freight travel through reduced winter hazards.Expected increases in temperature extremes,however,will have less positive impacts.More freeze–thaw con- ditions may occur,creating frost heaves and potholes on road and bridge surfaces and resulting in load restrictions on certain roads to minimize the damage.With the expected earlier onset of seasonal warming,the period of springtime load restrictions may be reduced in some areas but is likely to expand in others with shorter winters but longer thaw seasons. Periods ofexcessive summer heat are likely to increase wildfires,threat- ening communities and infrastructure directly and bringing about road and rail closures in affected areas. Longer periods of extreme heat may compromise pavement integrity (e.g.,softening asphalt and increasing rut- ting from traffic); cause deformation of rail lines and derailments or,at a minimum, speed restrictions (Rossetti 2002);6 and cause thermal expan- sion of bridge joints, adversely affecting bridge operation and increasing maintenance costs.Pipelines in the lower 48 states are not likely to experi- ence adverse effects from heat extremes. Marine Transportation Marine transportation infrastructure includes ports and harbors and supporting intermodal terminals and the ships and barges that use these facilities. Expected climate change impacts differ for coastal and inland waterways. Warming winter temperatures,particularly in northern coastal areas, could be a boon for marine transportation. Fewer days below freezing would reduce problems with ice accumulation on vessels,decks,riggings, and docks; the occurrence of dangerous ice fog; and the likelihood of ice jams in ports.The striking thinning (Rothrock and Zhang 2005) and over- all downward trend in the extent (Stroeve et al.2005) of Arctic sea ice are regarded as a major opportunity for shippers (Annex 3-1). In the short 6Proper installation of continuous welded rail usually prevents kinks from occurring, but not always (Changnon 2006).",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 87 term,continued reduction in Arctic sea ice should result in more ice-free ports, improved access to both ports and natural resources in remote areas,and longer shipping seasons.In the longer term,shippers are look- ing forward to new Arctic shipping routes that could provide significant cost savings in shipping times and distances (see the discussion of Alaska below).For the next several decades,however,warming temperatures and melting sea ice are likely to result in increased variability in year-to-year shipping conditions and higher costs due to requirements for stronger ships and support systems (e.g., ice-capable ship designs, icebreaker escorts, search and rescue support) (ACIA 2004). In addition, improved access to remote areas may increase the risk ofenvironmental degradation to fragile ecosystems. Warming temperatures are also likely to provide longer shipping sea- sons for the St.Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes (Annex 3-1).Because of the complex interaction among warmer temperatures,reduced lake ice, and increased evaporation, however, all nine climate model simulations suggest lower lake levels as the climate warms (Great Lakes Regional Assessment Team 2000).7 With lower lake levels, ships will be unable to carry as much cargo,and hence shipping costs will increase,although some of the adverse economic impacts could be offset by a longer shipping sea- son.8 A recent study of the economic impact of climate change on Canadian commercial navigation on the Great Lakes, for example, found that predicted lowering of Great Lakes water levels would result in an esti- mated increase in shipping costs for Canadian commercial navigation of between 13 and 29 percent by 2050, all else remaining equal (Millard 2005).9 Lower water levels could also create periodic problems for river traffic,reminiscent of the stranded barges on the Mississippi River during the drought of 1988 (du Vair et al.2002).In the longer run,of course,less 7See in particular Chapter 4 on climate change and shipping/boating. 8According to the Lake Carriers’ Association, a 1,000-foot-long vessel typically used for intralake transport loses 270 tons of capacity for each inch of draft loss. (Draft is the distance between the water line and the bottom of the vessel.) Oceangoing vessels, sized for passage through the St. Lawrence Seaway, are approximately 740 feet long and lose 100 tons of capacity for each inch of draft lost (Great Lakes Regional Assessment Team 2000). 9Impacts were estimated on the basis of three climate scenarios: one that assumes a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of CO by midcentury and two that assume a more gradual increase 2 in greenhouse gases and include the cooling effects of sulfate aerosols. The study found that economic impacts varied widely by commodity and route.",
        "88 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation efficient waterborne commodity movement would likely result in shifts to other transportation modes, such as truck and rail. Increased dredging could offset some of the impacts of climate change,but at a high cost and with potentially negative environmental consequences. Air Transportation Air transportation comprises airports and ground facilities,as well as the airplanes that carry both passengers and freight and the air traffic control system. Warming temperatures and possible increases in temperature extremes will affect airport ground facilities—runways in particular—in much the same way that they will affect roads.In Alaska,where use of air transport is atypically high relative to land transportation modes and many airstrips are built on permafrost,continued retreat and thawing of permafrost could undermine runway foundations, necessitating major repairs or even relocation of some landing strips (Annex 3-1;U.S.Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003).In contrast,airports in many of the lower 48 northern states are likely to benefit from reduc- tions in the cost of snow and ice removal and in the environmental impacts of salt and chemical use. Airlines could benefit as well from reduced need for deicing ofairplanes.The amount ofany reduction,how- ever,will depend on the balance between expected warming and increased precipitation. More heat extremes,however,are likely to be problematic.They could cause heat buckling of runways. Extreme heat can also affect aircraft lift; hotter air is less dense,reducing mass flowing over the wing to create lift. The problem is exacerbated at high-altitude airports. If runways are not sufficiently long for large aircraft to build up enough speed to generate lift, aircraft weight must be reduced or some flights canceled altogether.Thus, increases in extreme heat are likely to result in payload restrictions,flight cancellations, and service disruptions at affected airports, and could require some airports to extend runway lengths,if feasible.An analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the Denver and Phoenix airports estimated summer cargo loss (June through August) for a single Boeing 747 of about 17 and 9 percent, respectively, by 2030 because ofthe effects ofincreased temperature and water vapor (T.R.Karl and D.M. Anderson, Emerging Issues in Abrupt Climate Change, brief- ing,March 12,2007).",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 89 Impacts of Increased Heavy Precipitation and Sea Level Rise Land Transportation Modes The frequency,intensity,and duration of intense precipitation events are important factors in design specifications for transportation infrastruc- ture.Probabilistic estimates of rainfall intensities for a range of durations (5 minutes to 24 hours) for return periods,or recurrence intervals,of 20, 50,and 100 years have been used by civil engineers for designs ofroad cul- verts, storm water drainage systems, and road- and rail beds. Projected increases in intense precipitation events will necessitate updating design specifications to provide for greater capacity and shorter recurrence inter- vals,increasing system costs. The most immediate impact of more intense precipitation will be increased flooding ofcoastal roads and rail lines (Annex 3-1).Expected sea level rise will aggravate the flooding because storm surges will build on a higher base,reaching farther inland (Titus 2002).In fact,the chapter in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report on North America identifies coastal flooding from expected sea level rise and storm surge,especially along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts,as one of the most serious effects of climate change (Burkett 2002 in Field et al.2007).Indeed,several studies of sea level rise project that transporta- tion infrastructure in some coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic will be permanently inundated sometime in the next century (Dingerson 2005; Gornitz and Couch 2000; Leatherman et al 2000; Titus 2002).Low-lying bridge and tunnel entrances for roads,rail,and rail tran- sit will also be more susceptible to flooding, and thousands of culverts could be undersized for flows.Engineers must be prepared to deal with the resulting erosion and subsidence ofroad bases and rail beds,as well as ero- sion and scouring ofbridge supports.10Interruption ofroad and rail traffic is likely to become more common with more frequent flooding. The impact of sea level rise is limited to coastal areas,but the effect of intense precipitation on land transportation infrastructure and opera- tions is not. For example, a record-breaking 24-hour rainstorm in July 10Scour is the hole left behind when sediment (sand and rocks) is washed away from the bottom of a river. Although scour may occur at any time, scour action is especially strong during floods. Swiftly flowing water has more energy than calm water to lift and carry sediment downriver. Removal of sediment from around bridge piers or abutments (piers are the pillars supporting a bridge and abutments the supports at each end of a bridge) can weaken and ultimately undermine the integrity of bridges (Warren 1993).",
        "90 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 1996 resulted in flash flooding in Chicago and its suburbs, with major impacts on the urban area.Extensive travel delays occurred on metropol- itan highways and railroads, and streets and bridges were damaged. Commuters were unable to reach Chicago for up to 3 days,and more than 300 freight trains were delayed or rerouted (Changnon 1999). Pipelines may also be affected by increased intense precipitation. For example, federal regulations require that pipelines carrying hazardous materials in the lower 48 states be buried with a minimum of 3 feet of cover—up to 5 feet near heavily populated areas.Intense precipitation can erode soil cover and cause subsidence (i.e., sinking of the earth under- neath the pipeline).Scour and shifting of pipelines are a major problem in shallow riverbeds, where pipelines are more exposed to the elements (B. Cooper, Association of Oil Pipe Lines, personal communication, Dec. 7, 2006). Ultrashallow seabed waters can also be a problem if the pipeline becomes exposed and subject to potential movement and even fracture from continuing storm wave action. Changes in seasonal precipitation levels,with more precipitation falling as rain than snow,can be beneficial but can also create problems in certain areas.For example,California’s transportation infrastructure could be sen- sitive to even modest changes from frozen to liquid precipitation. When precipitation falls as rain rather than snow,it leads to immediate runoffand increases the risk of floods,landslides,slope failures,and consequent dam- age to roadways,especially rural roadways in the winter and spring months (du Vair et al. 2002). Navigable rivers with both rainfall and snowmelt responses would probably see greater winter volume flows associated with a greater risk of flooding (U.S.Global Change Research Program 1999). Marine Transportation Coastal ports and harbor facilities will be affected by increased intense precipitation and sea level rise.Landside facilities will be particularly vul- nerable to flooding from an increase in intense precipitation events and to the impacts ofhigher tides and storm surges from rising seas (Annex 3-1). Sea level with respect to dock level is an important consideration at both wet and dry docks,general cargo docks,and container berths for clearance ofdock cranes and other structures.Changes due to increased intense pre- cipitation and sea level rise could require some retrofitting of facilities.At a minimum, they are likely to result in increased weather-related delays and periodic interruption of shipping services.",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 91 The navigability of shipping channels is also likely to change. Some channels may be more accessible to shipping farther inland because of sea level rise. The navigability of others, however, could be adversely affected by changes in sedimentation rates and the location ofshoals.In other areas, a combination of sea level rise and storm surge could eliminate waterway systems entirely. For example, the Gulf Coast portion of the intercoastal waterway will likely disappear with continued land subsidence and the dis- appearance ofbarrier islands.This will bring an end to coastal barge traffic, which helps offset rail and highway congestion;all ships will have to navi- gate the open seas. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita alone destroyed 217 square miles ofcoastal wetlands.This loss represents slightly more than two-fifths of that which scientists had previously predicted would take place over the 50-year period from 2000 to 2050 (Barras 2006). The increased intense precipitation and periodic droughts predicted for the midcontinental United States will affect shipping on the Mississippi and Missouri River system.Increased precipitation could bring a repetition ofthe floods that devastated travel on the Upper Mississippi River in 1993. Droughts have a greater influence on commercial navigation on the lower portion of the river—from St.Louis to the Gulf—where there are no locks and dams and channel depths are entirely dependent on river flows. The 1988 drought, for example, stranded more than 4,000 barges, shifting freight to the railroads, which experienced increased business in hauling grains and other bulk commodities (Changnon 2006;du Vair et al.2002). In a recent study ofclimate change impacts on the lock and dam system on the Middle Mississippi, between the Missouri and Ohio Rivers, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concluded that the uncertainty associated with predicting future river flows called for a “wait and see,” monitoring approach rather than for expensive infrastructure improvements (Institute for Water Resources 2005). Nevertheless, feasibility studies for navigation projects have a 50-year planning horizon,thus requiring at least some con- sideration of the impacts of climate change and identification of the most robust strategies under a range of different possible scenarios. Air Transportation Several ofthe nation’s largest airports lie in coastal zones,built along tidal waters, sometimes on fill (Titus 2002). Their runways are particularly vulnerable to flooding and erosion from increased intense precipitation",
        "92 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation and, in the longer term, from sea level rise. Some airports, such as New York’s LaGuardia,are protected by dikes (see the discussion below of the Metropolitan East Coast Assessment),but others may require protection. At a minimum,increased intense precipitation is likely to cause increased disruptions and delays in air service and periodic airport closures. Impacts of More Intense Tropical Storms Climate scientists believe that more intense tropical storms are a likely effect of climate change. Three aspects of tropical storms are relevant to transportation: precipitation, winds, and wind-induced storm surge. All three tend to be much greater during strong storms.Such storms tend to have longer periods of intense precipitation;wind damage increases with wind speed;and wind-induced storm surge and wave action can have dev- astating effects. All modes of infrastructure are affected by more intense tropical storms.Sustained storm surge and damaging wave action displaced high- way and rail bridge decks during the recent hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, not to mention the loss of thousands of sign and signal supports. Shipping was disrupted,and barges that were unable to get out of harm’s way in time were destroyed. Airports were closed and sustained wind damage.Refineries were damaged,and barge traffic between offshore drill sites and coastal pumping facilities was suspended. The vulnerability of different transportation modes,as well as their resilience to intense tropi- cal storms, is well documented by the case study of the transportation sector’s response to and recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita dis- cussed later in this chapter. REVIEW OF ASSESSMENTS FOR PARTICULAR AREAS OR REGIONS Few studies have attempted to examine the potential impacts of climate change on transportation in a particular area or region.Those the com- mittee found are briefly reviewed in this section. The Metropolitan East Coast Assessment This study ofthe impacts ofclimate change in the tristate area ofNew York, New Jersey, and Connecticut focused on transportation infrastructure",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 93 because of the enormous value of the Metropolitan East Coast’s (MEC’s) highly developed infrastructure to the region’s nearly $1 trillion economy (Jacob et al.2007).11With more than 2,000 km of shoreline and extensive areas of vulnerable residential development and business centers and sup- porting infrastructure,the focus was on the effects of sea level rise. The study used two global climate models,tailored to the MEC area,to describe possible future climate scenarios over the 21st century.12The pro- jections showed a potential rise in sea level of 0.24 to 1.08 m (nearly 0.8 to 3.5 ft) between the reference year, 1980, and 2080. More important, the combined effect of sea level rise and storm surge could result in flood heights for the 100-year coastal storm of 3.2 to 4.2 m (10.5 to nearly 14 ft) above the current reference height of 2.96 m (nearly 10 ft) for New York City. Thus, projected increases in sea level could raise the frequency of coastal storm surges and related flooding by a factor of 3, on average. Moreover,the return interval ofthe 100-year storm could shorten to as lit- tle as 4 to 60 years,depending on the climate scenario. Elevation maps of areas within the 3-m (10-ft) reference height above current sea level reveal that roughly 10 percent of the total MEC land area—portions of lower Manhattan; coastal areas of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and Nassau County; and the New Jersey Meadowlands— could experience a marked increase in flooding frequency (see Figure 3-1). Many critical transportation infrastructure facilities lie at elevations 2 to 6 m (6 to 20 ft) above present sea level—well within the range of current and projected coastal storm surges of hurricanes and more frequent nor’easters (see Figure 3-2).Most area rail and tunnel entrance points,for example,as well as three major airports,lie at elevations of 3 m or less.13 11The study, one of 18 regional components of the U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Changeorganized by the U.S. Global Change Research program under the Clinton administration, was one of the only assessments that examined transportation infrastructure. 12The two models used were the United Kingdom Hadley Centre model and the model from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis. For a more detailed discussion, see Jacob et al. 2000. 13Some of these facilities are protected but may need modification. For example, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), an active participant in the MEC study, built a dike and levee system to protect LaGuardia Airport. After the severe nor’easter in 1992, PANYNJ built floodgates to protect the Port Authority Trans-Hudson tunnel under the Hudson River, which had flooded and put commuter trains out of operation for 10 days (Jacob et al. 2007).",

For example, the nor’easter of December 1992 pro- duced some of the worst flooding in the area in 40 years, resulting in an almost complete shutdown ofthe regional transportation system and evac- uation of many seaside communities (Jacob et al. 2007). More recently, heavy rainstorms in September 2004 and in August 2007 crippled the New York City transit system.Torrential rainfall (nearly 3 inches of rain in a 1-hour period in the 2007 event) overwhelmed the drainage system, designed to handle only about halfthat amount ofrainfall,sending water into the subway tunnels (Chan 2007).

Flooding and storm surge will only be exacerbated by sea level rise. The New York metropolitan area is constantly rehabilitating and modern- izing its aging capital stock, providing opportunities to build in new protections against potential increased flooding.The MEC study proposes several measures,including incorporating sea level rise into the design,sit- ing, and construction of new infrastructure facilities or renovation of existing facilities;recognizing sea level rise in federal Flood Insurance Rate Maps used by many local jurisdictions for land use planning and con- struction regulations; instituting land use measures to prevent new or further development in highly vulnerable coastal areas; and constructing strategically placed storm surge barriers, similar to those in operation in teeF Holland JFK LGA Lincoln Passenger Tunnel Airport Airport Tunnel Ship Terminal",

Climate’s Long-Term Impacts on Metro Boston Study The Environmental Protection Agency funded a 3-year project to study the potential impacts of climate change on infrastructure systems, including transportation,in the metropolitan Boston area and to recommend strate- gies for preventing, reducing, or managing the risk (Kirshen n.d.). The long-term economic success and quality of life of the region depend heav- ily on reliable infrastructure systems,which could be adversely affected by climate change.The concern is that global warming may result in sea level rise and increased flooding,higher peak summer temperatures,and more frequent and intense winter and summer storms with higher storm surges. At the same time,continued population and economic growth will result in increased development pressure on already vulnerable coastal and river- ine areas,increasing not only the amount of infrastructure at risk but also the amount of runoff that must be handled by area rivers, streams, and storm water systems (Suarez et al.2005). The human and economic costs of disruption to infrastructure sys- tems from flooding and storm surge in the area were dramatically illustrated by the devastating storm of October 1996. Drainage systems were inadequate to handle the 100-year storm. Backups and overflows affected several sections of the city, causing $70 million in property damage in addition to disrupting business and personal travel (Kirshen et al. 2004, 71). Portions of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and Northeastern University were flooded, as were a Green Line tunnel and four rapid transit stations, causing major damage and interrupted ser- vice for several weeks. The study analyzed climate change impacts on seven sectors, includ- ing transportation.14 The impact analysis for land transportation systems focused on flooding and impacts on the road system, emphasizing the effect on system performance rather than on infrastructure damage (Suarez et al. 2005). The methodology involved integrating projected changes in land use,demographics,economic activity,and climatic condi- 14The sectors were energy use, sea level rise, river flooding, water supply, public health (heat- stress mortality), localized systems (water quality, tall buildings, bridge scour), and transportation.",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 97 tions into the urban transportation modeling system of the Boston Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC).15The model was then used to simulate traffic flows for a range of different flooding scenarios for a base case year (2003) and a future year (2025),incorporating anticipated socioeconomic changes,as well as projected new links or increased capac- ity in the road network.16 Finally, the models were rerun to take into account the aggregate effect of increased flooding on delays and lost trips over the period 2000 to 2100.17 The results show that delays and trips lost between the baseline year 2000 and 2100 would increase by 80 and 82 percent,respectively,as a result of increased flooding attributable to climate change (Suarez et al. 2005, 240). Nevertheless, because of the large number of daily baseline trips in the Boston metropolitan area—approximately 14.6 million in 2000—these percentage increases represent relatively modest effects. The results also reflect the redundancy of the transportation network that is typical of a mature metropolitan area,which lessens but does not eliminate vulnerabil- ity. For example, although coastal areas are more densely populated, the road network is less redundant,so that residents are unable to make trips when the roads become inundated. In contrast, riverine floods result in increased vehicle miles and vehicle hours traveled. Travelers have more alternative routes available,but many are major commuter routes,thereby increasing congestion and time traveled (Suarez et al.2005). The report concludes that even if one uses high monetized values for lost trips and incremental delays,the impacts are “significant,but proba- bly not large enough to justify a major effort for adapting the physical 15MAPC forecasts population and employment growth to 2025 at the town level, providing the best available estimates of the spatial evolution of people and economic growth in the region. The study assumed that similar growth trends would persist up to 2050 and then remain constant. The Canadian Climate Centre and Hadley Centre climate scenarios used in the New England Regional Assessment—another regional component of the U.S. National Assessment—were superimposed over time series data on local weather conditions to provide the climate change predictions for 2001 to 2100 (Kirshen et al. 2004). 16Twelve flooding scenarios were developed to reflect different years of simulation, areas flooded (none, 100-year, and 500-year floodplains), and type of flooding (coastal, riverine, or both). Flood Insurance Rate Maps were used to identify coastal and riverine floodplains, and these were overlaid on maps showing land use and the road networks within the boundary of each traffic analysis zone used in the model (Kirshen et al. 2004). 17Two climate states were modeled—one assuming no climate change, projecting past trends into the future by bootstrapping from 50 years of rainfall and sea level data for the Boston area, and the second assuming climate changes in line with available climate model predictions. The difference in network performance between the two scenarios was attributed to climate change (Kirshen et al. 2004).",
        "98 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation infrastructure to expected climatic conditions,except for some key links” (Suarez et al.2005,231).The study,however,did not take into considera- tion the potential physical damage to transportation infrastructure and repair costs due to climate change that also must be part ofany investment decision. Seattle Audit of Climate Change Impacts Since the early 1990s, Seattle has been a leader in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005).Because the impacts ofclimate change are likely to persist well into the 21st century,however,policy makers have also recognized the need to develop appropriate adaptation strategies.Seattle’s Office of City Auditor initiated a series of reviews of how changes in the climate of the Pacific Northwest region would affect the operations and infrastructure of various city departments. The first review was focused on the Seattle Department ofTransportation (SDOT),which is responsible for the city’s $8 billion transportation infrastructure, including its roadways, most bridges,and bike paths (Soo Hoo and Simitani 2005). The primary changes predicted by climate scientists for the Pacific Northwest in the 21st century are warmer temperatures, rising sea levels, and increased winter precipitation.The study identified five potential types of impact. First, increased winter precipitation could lead to more flooding and landslides,which could damage the city’s transportation infrastructure and underlying utilities and hamper the mobility and safety of travel.18 More flooding,for example,could overwhelm the existing storm water drainage system,causing soil saturation and surface erosion.It could also exacerbate erosion of soil around roads,bridge footings,and retaining walls. Second, rising sea levels could affect the adequacy of seawall heights and bridge clearances. SDOT had considered sea level rise in developing design standards for a major Alaskan Way Seawall replacement project,but questions were raised regarding whether the projected sea level rise was underestimated. 18 Seattle Public Utilities has primary responsibility for responding to emergencies, such as landslides and surface flooding. However, SDOT is primarily responsible when the structural integrity of public streets, bridges, and retaining walls is threatened (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005).",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 99 Third, increased precipitation and temperatures and sea level rise would adversely affect bridge operations.More than one-third of Seattle’s 105 bridges are currently rated as being in poor condition.19Warmer tem- peratures could cause greater thermal expansion at bridge expansion joints, affecting bridge operations and adding to maintenance costs. Increased winter precipitation could exacerbate erosion around bridge footings,and rising sea levels could affect bridge clearances (see Figure 3-3). Fourth,warmer temperatures and increased precipitation could cause roadways to deteriorate.SDOT is responsible for approximately 1,500 lane miles ofarterial streets and 2,700 lane miles ofnonarterial streets.The city’s arterial streets are in good condition, but there is a backlog of repair and resurfacing projects. Climate changes could shorten street lives (Figure 3-3). Hotter summers could result in pavement softening and buckling and the appearance of heat bumps, although use of warmer- temperature asphalt mix could mitigate some of these effects. Increased precipitation would increase street flooding and tax drainage systems. Finally, warmer and longer summers and reduced summer precipita- tion would place stress on trees and landscaped areas in the city’s rights- of-way,requiring increased maintenance.20SDOT’s Urban Forestry unit is already considering the use ofdrought-resistant plants and other strategies to offset the negative effects of climate change. In response to the report, SDOT noted that it is including climate change as a factor in the scoping of new projects. It is also undertaking a new asset management effort that will focus on replacement cycles for all transportation infrastructure;climate change impacts will be considered as one factor in determining the adequacy ofproposed replacement and reha- bilitation projects (E. Paschke, SDOT, personal communication,April 14, 2006).That being said,SDOT noted that the long time frames and uncer- tainties of expected climate changes, coupled with maintenance backlogs and short-term planning horizons for operating budgets,justify “a prudent approach: one that combines watchfulness in following trends in climate 19 According to the 2004 Report of the Citizens’ Transportation Advisory Committee,37 percent of the city’s bridges are in “poor condition or worse,” and 4 percent already face weight restrictions because of critical deficiencies (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005, 20). 20 SDOT’s Urban Forestry unit maintains an inventory of 130 acres of land in city rights-of-way. Approximately 30,000 trees are located on city-owned land, with an estimated value of $100 million. Approximately half of the city’s landscaped areas are currently rated as being in good condition (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005, 24).",

Finally, SDOT officials recommended an interdepartmental team to coordinate a comprehensive assessment of projections for sea level rise, as well as data on other issues related to cli- mate change, that could be used to revise existing or establish new and consistent standards reflecting climate change across all city infrastructure investment projects (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005). Alaska Alaska is already experiencing some ofthe effects ofclimate change,such as warming temperatures and continued shrinkage of permafrost regions— areas of permanently frozen ground below the surface layer—with conse- quences for all modes of land transportation.21Warming temperatures are also affecting marine transportation.Decreased concentrations and extent ofsea ice in the Arctic Ocean have lengthened the ice-free shipping season, expanded shipping along the Northern Sea Route, and opened the possi- bility of a Northwest Passage for shipping.22 At the same time, however, more open seas have exposed coastal villages along northern and western Alaska to increased storms and wave action,with attendant erosion.Coastal villages,along with their infrastructure,will need greater protection or may have to be relocated (G.Wendler,Geophysical Institute Climate Center,per- sonal communication,March 2,2006). As noted earlier, Alaska’s transportation infrastructure differs from that ofthe lower 48 states.Although Alaska is twice the size ofTexas,both its population and road mileage are more like Vermont’s. Of its 12,700 21Permafrost refers to soil, rock, or sediment that has remained below 32°F for 2 or more consecutive years (ACIA 2004). The 2-year designation is intended to exclude the overlying ground surface layer that freezes each winter and thaws each summer. Regions are classified into continuous permafrost zones, in which the permafrost occupies the entire area, and sporadic or discontinuous permafrost zones, in which the permafrost underlies from 10 to 90 percent of the land and may be only a few meters thick in places. Permafrost is further classified into two types: (a) cold permafrost, where temperatures remain below at least 30°F, and the introduction of considerable heat can be tolerated without thawing; and (b) warm permafrost, where temperatures remain just below freezing, and very little additional heat may induce thawing. 22The Northern Sea Route encompasses all routes across the Russian Arctic coastal seas to the Bering Strait. The Northwest Passage is the name given to the marine routes between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans along the northern coast of North America that span the straits and the sounds of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.",
        "102 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation miles of roads,for example,only about 30 percent are paved (U.S.Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003,28).The road and rail networks are concentrated largely in the south-central part of the state, near major population centers.Transport by air is much more common than in most states. Alaska has 84 commercial airports and more than 3,000 airstrips, many of which serve as the only means of transport for rural communities. The state also is home to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). Two recent studies (ACIA 2004; U.S. Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003) considered the impacts ofa warming Arctic on both Alaska and its infrastructure, particularly the effects on permafrost. The band of discontinuous,warm permafrost has been moving northward for some years.For highways,thawing of the permafrost causes settling of the roadbed and frost heaves that adversely affect roadway performance, such as load-carrying capacity. The majority of the state’s highways are located in areas where permafrost is discontinuous,and dealing with thaw settlement problems already claims a significant portion of highway maintenance dollars [M. Miles, Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (DOT&PF),personal communication,March 3,2006]. Nevertheless, a road rehabilitation cycle of about 15 years is sufficiently short to enable engineers to adapt to changing climate conditions. Thus, they are able to anticipate some problems created by thawing prior to con- struction and have developed a number of mitigation techniques.23 In addition, the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL),24in partnership with DOT&PF and the University ofAlaska,has developed a web-based geographic information system tool—the Alaska Engineering Design Information System (AEDIS)—for use in monitoring and design. AEDIS provides geographic-specific data on climate factors, such as precipitation levels,permafrost,and snow depth,that can be used to derive engineering design parameters (e.g.,load-bearing capacity),schedule maintenance, and select optimum transportation routes (T. Douglas, CRREL,personal communication,March 9,2006). 23For example, insulation can be placed in the road prism (area of road containing the road surface, cut slope and fill slope), and different types of passive refrigeration schemes can be used, including thermosiphons, rock galleries, and “cold culverts” (M. Miles, Alaska DOT&PF personal communication, March 3, 2006). 24The Civil and Infrastructure Engineering Branch of CRREL, part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, conducts applied research and develops innovative engineering solutions for facilities and infrastructure that operate under freezing, thawing, and extreme temperature differences.",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 103 Less flexible and longer-lived bridges and large culverts are sensitive to movement caused by thawing permafrost and are more difficult than roads to repair and modify for changing site conditions. Thus, designing these facilities to take climate change into account is more critical than is the case for roads (O.Smith,University of Alaska,Anchorage,personal communi- cation, March 1, 2006). Another impact of climate change on bridges is increased scour.Hotter,dryer summers have led to increased glacial melt- ing and longer periods of high streamflows, leading to both increased sediment transport on rivers and scour at bridge crossings.A network of sonars has been installed on several scour-critical bridges around the state, and the monitoring data are regularly sent to Alaska DOT&PF (J.Conaway, United States Geological Survey,personal communication,March 8,2006). Temporary ice roads and bridges are commonly used in many parts of Alaska to access northern communities and provide support for the min- ing and oil and gas industries.Rising temperatures have already shortened the season during which these critical facilities can be used (ACIA 2004). Like the highway system, the Alaska Railroad crosses permafrost ter- rain, but the railroad does not extend northward into the zone of continuous permafrost. While frost heave and settlement from thawing affect some portions ofthe track,increasing maintenance costs,major relo- cations of existing track will not likely be required (U.S. Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003). Alaska’s airports and airstrips are located throughout the state.A signifi- cant number ofairstrips in the southwest,the northwest,and the interior are built on permafrost and thus will require major repairs or relocation iftheir foundations are compromised by thawing (U.S.Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003). TAPS,which stretches from Prudhoe Bay in northern Alaska to the ice- free port of Valdez in the south,crosses a wide range of permafrost types and varying temperature conditions. More than half of the 800-mile pipeline is elevated on vertical supports over thaw-unstable permafrost to avoid problems of permafrost degradation, soil liquefaction, and land subsidence (U.S. Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003).Because the system was designed in the early 1970s on the basis of permafrost and climate conditions of the 1950–1970 period, it requires continuous monitoring, and some supporting members have had to be replaced. The Federal–State Joint Pipeline Office, which regulates TAPS, and the Alyeska Pipeline Company, which operates it, do not regard",
        "104 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation permafrost degradation as a problem,but this assessment does not take into account the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment predictions for the next 30 years (U.S.Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force 2003). Arctic marine transport will benefit from climate changes. Obser- vations over the past 50 years show a decline in the extent ofArctic sea ice in all seasons, with the most prominent retreat in the summer (ACIA 2004).Climate models project an acceleration of this trend,opening new shipping routes and extending shipping seasons along Arctic coastlines, including Alaska. Improved accessibility, however, will not be uniformly distributed. For example, the navigation season25 for the Northern Sea Route is projected to increase from 20 to 30 days per year to about 90 to 100 days by 2080 (ACIA 2004,83).For trans-Arctic voyages,this route rep- resents up to a 40 percent savings in distance from northern Europe to northeastern Asia and the northwest coast of North American compared with southerly routes via the Suez or Panama Canal.In contrast,reduction in the extent of sea ice may create highly variable conditions in the Northwest Passage, reflecting the complex geography of the Canadian Arctic that could not be captured by the regional climate models used for the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment. In sum,recent climate change assessments show that Alaska is already experiencing the effects of climate change, particularly warming of the Arctic climate and thawing of permafrost. The effects are projected to accelerate during this century (ACIA 2004),and Alaska’s experience with adaptation may be instructive for some other cold-weather regions ofthe United States.Most ofthe state’s transportation infrastructure was designed for permafrost, and those systems with relatively short rehabilitation cycles relative to projected climate changes will have time to adapt to the changes. Nevertheless, projected changes are likely to require at best increased monitoring of climate conditions and higher maintenance costs,and at worst more major retrofits or even relocation of some facil- ities.According to one transportation professional,the greatest challenge lies not in dealing with the impacts ofclimate change but in not knowing exactly what changes to expect or when (B. Connor, Alaska University Transportation Center,personal communication,March 9,2006). 25The navigation season is generally defined as the number of days per year when there is less than 50 percent sea-ice concentration.",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 105 Gulf Coast The committee commissioned a special case study of the transportation sector’s response to and recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.26One of the primary objectives of this study was to examine the vulnerability of the transportation system to a major disruption, with a particular focus on the impact of an interruption on national-level movement of freight. The Gulf Coast is one of the key economic and population centers of the United States,home to more than 15 million Americans located in five states (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida) and three major metropolitan areas. The low-lying flat land along the Gulf Coast, skirting the subtropical waters ofthe GulfofMexico,makes the region vul- nerable to major hurricanes,more so than any other region in the United States.However,the geography that makes the coastal area dangerous dur- ing hurricanes also makes it attractive for industrial and commercial development. Several of the nation’s most heavily used ports are located along the GulfCoast.The Ports ofSouth Louisiana and Houston—among the world’s 10 most heavily used ports—are particularly attractive to inter- national shippers because of the area’s centralized location with respect to the rest of the nation and its wealth of transportation connections by pipeline, highway, rail, and river. The Gulf of Mexico also contains some ofthe largest U.S.oilfields and,with its large share ofdomestic natural gas and petroleum production, combined with its status as a major energy importer,is the epicenter of the U.S.petrochemical industry. Hurricane Katrina was the most destructive and costliest natural disas- ter in U.S.history,claiming more than 1,800 lives and causing an estimated $75 billion in damage.Hurricane Rita,exceeding Katrina in both intensity and maximum wind speed, claimed 120 lives and caused approximately $10 billion in damage.The significantly lower casualty and damage levels of Rita can be attributed to its easterly track, which spared the Houston metropolitan area from the worst of the storm.The unusually large losses of life and physical destruction of Hurricane Katrina resulted from a levee failure and the inability of the floodwaters to recede because so much of New Orleans lies below sea level.A failed evacuation plan for the car-less exacerbated the human toll. Both storms seriously disrupted transporta- tion systems. Key highway and railroad bridges were heavily damaged or 26This section draws heavily on the commissioned paper, by Grenzeback and Lukmann (2007).",
        "106 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation destroyed,necessitating rerouting oftraffic and placing increased strain on other routes,particularly other rail lines.Barge shipping was halted,as was export grain traffic out of the Port of New Orleans, the nation’s largest export grain port.The pipeline network was shut down,producing short- ages of natural gas and petroleum products. Despite predictions of long-lasting transportation stoppages,however, the majority ofthe GulfCoast highways,rail lines,pipelines,ports,and air- ports were back in service within weeks to a month (see Table 3-2). The worst-damaged bridges took 3 to 6 months to repair.Just three bridges that carry highway US-90 along the edge ofthe GulfCoast failed to reopen until mid- to late 2007,approximately 2 years after they were destroyed. The fact that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had only a modest impact on national-level freight flows can be attributed primarily to redundancies in the transportation system, the timing of the storms, and the track of Hurricane Rita.For example,truck traffic was diverted from the collapsed bridge that carries highway I-10 over Lake Pontchartrain to highway I-12, which parallels I-10 well north ofthe GulfCoast.The primary north–south highways that connect the GulfCoast with the major inland transportation hubs were not damaged and were open for nearly full commercial freight movement within days.The railroads were able to reroute intermodal and carload traffic not bound directly for New Orleans through Memphis and other Midwest rail hubs. Although New Orleans is a major rail freight interchange point for east–west rail traffic,it is not itself a major origin or destination for rail freight. Had Hurricane Rita struck a larger industrial and transportation hub such as Houston,the effects on rail transportation and freight movement would have been greater and more costly. Timing also played a role. The hurricanes struck before the peak of the corn and soybean export season.Most of the Mississippi River ports and the inland waterway were back in service to handle peak export demand later in fall 2005.Finally,the major pipelines suffered relatively little damage and were able to open within days,as electrical power was restored. The hurricanes’impacts on national freight flows may have been mod- est,but they were certainly not without cost.A full accounting ofthe direct costs to repair transportation facilities damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita has not yet been compiled. Reported costs of individual projects shown in Table 3-2 total more than $1.1 billion. Replacement of the I-10 Twin Span Bridge between New Orleans and Slidell, Louisiana, will add nearly another $1 billion, and the repair and replacement of rail lines,",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 107 pipelines,ports,waterways,and airports will likely add several billion more to the total.Moreover,the numbers do not include the costs ofunreported emergency operating expenditures,lengthy detours,the opportunity costs oflost shipments,and the long-term costs ofdisplaced business and trade. What lessons were learned about the vulnerability of the transporta- tion system from the experience with these two hurricanes? First,with few exceptions, the physical redundancies of a mature transportation system provided sufficient alternative routes to keep freight flows moving with- out major disruption.Where the infrastructure was privately owned (e.g., CSX Railroad), arrangements with other carriers enabled operations to continue.Ofcourse,this outcome might be quite different ifmultiple cat- astrophic storms were to strike major industrial and transportation hubs in close succession—a plausible scenario in a climate-changed world. Second, restoration of transportation services depended heavily on the availability of electrical power and manpower.Electricity is critical for the highway system to operate traffic lights and signs,for railroads to operate signal systems and crossing gates,for ports to operate cranes and elevators, for airports to power air traffic control facilities and operate nighttime run- way lights,and for pipelines to power pumping stations.Thus,redundancy of power and communications systems is also necessary for the rapid restoration and functioning of freight transportation networks.Similarly, adequate manpower is critical to timely efforts to restore transportation services and staff restoration projects.Because of the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Katrina, many public- and private-sector employees lost family and homes in the storm, and many others evacuated the region; New Orleans itself was closed for more than a month.Thus,major trans- portation companies such as CSX were forced to bring in workers from other locations to staff reconstruction projects. Finally, the storms have resulted in plans for relocating at least one facility and redesigning others in anticipation of future hurricanes. The Port of New Orleans is considering relocating companies and facilities to the main port area on the Mississippi riverfront from the deep-water chan- nel connecting the port’s Inner Harbor navigation canal to the Gulf,where they are more vulnerable to future storms.The cost ofthe relocation is esti- mated at $350 million.CSX has considered moving its vulnerable rail line inland—less as a response to hurricane threats than as a response to Mississippi politicians who are interested in the land for casino and hous- ing development (M. Hinsdale, CSX, personal communication, Sept. 12,",

        "112 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 2006).And at the initiative and recommendation of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), almost all of the major river and bay bridges destroyed by the hurricane’s surge waters will be rebuilt at higher eleva- tions,above the maximum forecast surge levels.27 FINDINGS All modes oftransportation are vulnerable to climate change.Just as infra- structure is local and regional,however,so,too,are the impacts of climate change.They will vary depending on the location,mode,and condition of the transportation infrastructure. For example, coastal areas and their infrastructure will be subject to the impacts of sea level rise, while the St.Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes may experience lower water lev- els.The infrastructure will experience impacts unique to each mode (e.g., scour on bridge supports), but many impacts, such as flooding and ero- sion,will be common across all modes.The condition ofthe infrastructure itself will affect the impacts experienced. Increased intense precipitation, for example, could cause accelerated degradation of the surfaces of roads in poor condition. As the examples in this chapter have illustrated, the impacts of climate change on U.S. transportation will be widespread and costly. According to the most recent scientific assessment, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, the greatest impact of climate change on North America’s transportation system will be coastal flooding, especially along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts,because of sea level rise,aggravated in some locations by land subsidence and storm surge (Burkett 2002).However,the rate at which these changes are likely to occur remains uncertain.The cur- rent IPCC projections do not include melting of the Greenland ice mass, for example,which could accelerate sea level rise. Projected climate extremes are likely to have a particularly severe impact on transportation infrastructure because the U.S.transportation system was built to typical weather conditions at the time and local weather and climate 27Hurricane damage to the Gulf Coast bridges resulted primarily from a combination of storm surge and wave crests that simply lifted bridge decks off their supports. Thus, FHWA recommended that a 100-year rather than a 50-year design frequency be used for Interstates, major structures, and critical bridges and that design guidelines take into consideration a combination of wave and surge effects. It was also recommended that risk and cost assessments be conducted (FHWA 2005 in Meyer 2006). New standards have not yet been agreed upon, so it is unclear whether they will take forecasts of sea level rise into consideration.",
        "Impacts of Climate Change on Transportation 113 experience. Expected changes in climate extremes, such as more extreme temperatures,more intense precipitation,and more intense storms,could push environmental conditions outside the range for which the system was designed. This in turn could necessitate changes in design, materials, construction, and operating and maintenance practices. For example, increased flooding from more intense storms could require a combination of physical improvements (e.g., greater pumping capacity, more elevated bridges) and operational measures (e.g.,better flood warning and evacua- tion plans,better real-time micro-level weather forecasts). Climate change will create both winners and losers. For example, the marine transportation sector could benefit from more open seas in the Arctic,reducing shipping routes,times,and costs in the long run.In cold regions,expected temperature warming,particularly decreases in very cold days and later onset of seasonal freeze and earlier onset of seasonal thaw, could mean less snow and ice control for departments of transportation and safer travel conditions for passenger vehicles and freight. In all cases, transportation professionals will have to confront and adapt to climate change without knowing the full magnitude of expected changes.The greatest challenge is the uncertainty as to exactly what changes to expect and when. Thus, transportation decision makers will need to adopt a more probabilistic risk management approach to infrastructure planning, design, and operations to accommodate uncertainties about the nature and timing of expected climate changes—a major focus of the next chapter.

        "4 Challenges to Response T his chapter explores the challenges and constraints faced by trans- portation professionals as they begin to confront projected impacts of climate change.The chapter begins with an overview of how the U.S. transportation system is organized and how investment and operating decisions are made. These organizational arrangements and planning approaches influence how transportation decision makers consider the issue of climate change and help explain why responding poses difficult challenges—the next topic of discussion.A framework for addressing the uncertainties and analyzing the trade-offs associated with adaptation to climate change is then introduced.The chapter ends with the committee’s findings,suggesting opportunities for meeting the challenges to response. DECISION MAKING IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR Organization and Funding Responsibility for transportation infrastructure is decentralized and shared between the public and private sectors (see Table 4-1).Highways, bridges,and public transportation infrastructure are owned and operated by state and local governments.1Major funding for capital improvements— and in the case of public transportation, rolling stock (e.g., transit buses, railcars)—is provided by the federal government, with matching 1 Highways and bridges on federal lands are an exception, as are privately owned toll roads. In addition, the vehicles that use the highway system are privately owned, except for transit buses (see Table 4-1). 124",

        "126 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation requirements from other governmental levels.Railroads and pipelines are privately owned and operated,although the federal government has regu- latory oversight over railroad and pipeline safety.2 Ports are joint public–private operations. Typically, an independent authority or public entity owns the land and sometimes the landside facilities,which are then leased to private operators,generally on a long-term basis.Major improve- ments, such as dredging of harbors and channels, are federally funded through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with required cost sharing.3 The St.Lawrence Seaway system is jointly operated by the U.S.government and Canada through management corporations established expressly for this purpose, while the inland waterway system, including upkeep of the lock system, is operated by the U.S. government through the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers,also with cost-sharing arrangements.Airports are pub- licly owned and operated by local governments or independent authorities. At the major hub airports,the airlines often operate their own hangars and maintenance facilities. Many airport capital improvements are federally funded, supplemented with state and local grants and passenger facility charges. In sum, decision making in the transportation sector is a shared responsibility among many governmental owner–operators and the pri- vate sector,largely decentralized,and modally focused. Infrastructure Service Lives Transportation infrastructure is designed to perform for a wide range of service lives (see Table 4-2).4 Roads are among the shortest-lived facili- ties, with surfaces that must be repaved every 10 to 20 years.5 Bridges, locks,and pipelines are among the longest-lived—designed for a 50- to 100-year service life—although many of their components (e.g., bridge decks) must be rehabilitated more frequently. Transportation facilities 2 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates the siting of new natural gas pipelines, and the U.S. Department of Transportation requires 3 feet of cover at initial construction of an oil pipeline. 3 There is some privately constructed and maintained infrastructure (e.g., channels to private terminals, private berthing areas). 4 Service life can be defined as the length of time a facility will remain in use to serve its intended function. This will often exceed the facility’s design life or the period of time used for economic analysis of project benefits and costs. 5 Typically, the road base is far more durable, unless it is compromised by poor drainage or other adverse conditions.",

Source:Meyer 2006. with shorter design lives provide numerous opportunities for engineers to adapt to the impacts of climate change,such as by use of more heat- resistant paving materials to withstand the more extreme temperatures projected for some U.S.regions.Opportunities for adaptation—for exam- ple,elevating a bridge to accommodate expected sea level rise—are fewer for longer-lived facilities, which are rehabilitated or retrofitted at much longer intervals. In practice, many transportation facilities perform well beyond their design lives.Moreover,the most critical decision is where to locate a facility initially.Once the right-of-way and alignment for a facility have been estab- lished, such as for a highway or rail line, relocating the right-of-way, as might be required in coastal areas experiencing sea level rise,would be enor- mously expensive.Thus,investment choices made today about the location, retrofitting,and rehabilitation oftransportation infrastructure will have far- reaching consequences for the ability of transportation infrastructure to accommodate climate change and for the costs ofany necessary adaptation.",
        "128 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Long-Range Planning and Investment Decisions For each mode, transportation professionals engage in planning for long-term capital improvements to infrastructure assets.Below is a brief summary of the planning process for publicly and privately owned infrastructure and the implications for addressing climate change. Publicly Owned Infrastructure Planning and investment decisions for publicly owned land transporta- tion infrastructure are made within the framework and requirements defined by the planning provisions contained in legislation; codified in Title 23,U.S.C.; and most recently amended in August 2005 by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users,known as SAFETEA-LU.State departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), working in coordination with local governments, have lead responsibilities for planning.6 The transportation planning process has two principal products:a long-range transportation plan and a short-term transportation improvement pro- gram. Because the infrastructure is largely in place, the vast majority of capital improvement projects involve retrofitting or upgrading the exist- ing transportation system or providing new capacity at the margin. Each state and metropolitan area with an MPO prepares a long-range plan, looking ahead 20 to 30 years. The plans incorporate forecasts of population, economic growth, and land use patterns to help determine the locus and extent of demand for passenger and freight travel and sup- porting transportation infrastructure needs. The second product—a transportation improvement program—provides a list ofshort-term cap- ital improvement projects, reflecting available funding, which is updated on a 4-year cycle. Joint Public–Private and Privately Owned Infrastructure Ports generally have a short planning horizon—5 to 10 years—because of the highly competitive nature ofport business operations.Analyses ofmajor capital improvements, however, such as landside facilities—warehouses, 6 The Highway Act of 1973 required the establishment of MPOs in urbanized areas with a population of more than 50,000 and dedicated a small portion of each state’s funding from the Highway Trust Fund for this purpose. MPOs are composed primarily of local elected officials whose purpose is to facilitate decision making on regional transportation issues.",
        "Challenges to Response 129 terminals,berths,rail links,and truck access roads—many of which have 40- to 50-year design lives, require forecasting of costs and expected returns over a much longer planning period.Similarly,the planning hori- zon for capital improvements to long-lived locks and dams along inland waterways is about 50 years. Airports have 20- to 30-year capital improvement plans for landside investments.Because many ofthese improvements are federally financed, the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as local airport authorities and local planners,is involved in the development oflong-range plans for airport infrastructure. The planning cycle for privately owned infrastructure—railroads and pipelines—is handled by individual companies through their capital budgeting process. Railroads are characterized by their capital intensity and large fixed investments. Even when a fully functional network is in place,large annual capital investments must be made to provide operat- ing equipment (e.g., locomotives, freight cars, maintenance vehicles, computer and signaling equipment) and maintain the physical right-of- way.7Capital budgets are part of strategic plans that look 5 years out and annual financial plans that identify the available budget for capital out- lays each year. Analyses of individual capital projects forecast costs and returns over 20- to more than 30-year lifetimes for major facilities,such as a double-tracking project or a new marshaling yard.8 Pipelines involve a large initial investment; assets are designed to be very long-lived (about 100 years);and there are few new entrants.Pipeline companies conduct market forecasts looking ahead 5 years at most. Planning for capital improvements follows the normal private-sector capital budgeting process (i.e.,project analysis using present value calcu- lations over asset lifetimes,minimum expected rates of return for project selection,and annual capital budgets). In sum, public and private transportation infrastructure providers are making short- and long-term investment decisions every day that have implications for how well the transportation system will respond to climate change in both the near and long terms. 7 These investments tend to be uneven or “lumpy,” however, because equipment, such as railcars, is purchased in batches. 8 Note, however, that discounting of future benefits at typical discount rates means that for financial purposes, benefits beyond, say, 20 years will be of diminishing importance.",
        "130 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Operational and Emergency Planning Transportation professionals in both the public and private sectors also engage in operational planning to respond to short-term congestion, delays,and disruptions to system operations.Transportation profession- als are keenly aware of the effects of weather on system performance and already address the impacts of weather on operations for a diverse range of climate conditions.For example,many departments of transportation have well-organized snow and ice control operations that can consume up to 40 percent of annual highway operating budgets in some northern U.S.states.Others are organizing to achieve better management of traffic congestion and incident control by establishing transportation manage- ment centers.9 Climate changes are expected to affect transportation primarily through climate extremes,such as more severe tropical storms and flooding from intense rainfall.One ofthe probable outcomes is the growing importance of transportation to emergency response and evacuation. The organiza- tional arrangements necessary to support this interaction are generally not well developed, although some regions have been more proactive in this regard. For example, Florida has a well-organized multigovern- mental approach to emergency planning and evacuation for hurricanes that includes transportation. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita provided a wake-up call to many governments in the Gulf Coast region,which have since improved emergency plans and evacuation strategies.The events of September 11,2001,were instrumental in focusing attention on the need for emergency plans and evacuation strategies and in underscoring the critical support transportation can provide. In practice, however, trans- portation is not always well integrated into these plans.Emergencies that involve multistate geographic areas and require a regional response are particularly difficult,as Hurricane Katrina illustrated (Deen 2006). In the longer term, critical infrastructure that serves as evacuation routes or egress points may itself be threatened by climate change. For example, highways in low-lying coastal areas could become endangered as encroaching sea level rise combines with storm surge to make these routes impassable. 9 For more detail, see the paper by Lockwood (2006) commissioned for this study. See also the discussion about transportation management centers in Chapter 5 (Box 5-1).",
        "Challenges to Response 131 CHALLENGES POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE Climate change poses a complex set of challenges that in many ways are new and different for transportation planners and decision makers, and this may help explain why there is little consensus on the issue or how to address it.10The lack ofa consistent response may also stem from resource constraints and an absence of adequate information and guidance. Differences in Planning Horizons Climate scientists describe the future in terms of outcomes that unfold over decades to centuries.One of the reasons for these long time frames is that the inherent variability of the climate makes it difficult to separate the “signal from the noise”in making short-term (i.e.,less than 25 years) projections. For many public-sector transportation planners, long-term planning horizons rarely exceed more than 30 years; 20 to 25 years is the norm.Port,rail,and pipeline providers have much shorter planning horizons—5 years at most for strategic plans—although many of their assets are designed to be much longer-lived, and capital project analyses reflect these longer time frames.Thus,many transportation planners per- ceive that impacts of climate change will be experienced well beyond the time frame of their longest-term plans,not realizing that climate changes are already occurring and that investment decisions made today will affect how well the infrastructure accommodates these and future changes. Treatment of Uncertainty The issue of climate change introduces uncertainties with which trans- portation planners are unfamiliar and uncomfortable.Climate scientists describe the future in probabilistic terms with a portfolio of plausible scenarios and outcomes that are constantly refined and revised as new knowledge accumulates.Uncertainties exist with regard to the rate of cli- mate change and the extent of its impacts,even for those changes about which climate scientists have the greatest confidence, such as warming temperatures and sea level rise. These uncertainties make it difficult to 10 See the paper by Dewar and Wachs (2006) commissioned for this study for a more complete discussion of many points made in this section.",
        "132 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation plan and design infrastructure that can accommodate these impacts.The likelihood of climate extremes and surprises only exacerbates the prob- lem. Moreover, knowledge about climate change impacts is likely to change over time,requiring a dynamic decision process that can adapt to new information and accommodate feedback. In contrast to climate scientists,transportation professionals tend to focus on “knowns.” Metropolitan transportation planners, for example, typically provide a single vision of the future on the basis of“best avail- able” forecasts of population, employment, housing, and development that drive transportation infrastructure needs. Infrastructure is built to meet the forecast demand, often without fully incorporating uncertain- ties associated with the predictions.Unexpected,unplanned events,such as earthquakes,hurricanes,and floods,challenge the system,but a com- bination of traveler adaptability and system redundancy has enabled transportation infrastructure providers thus far to maintain operations with surprisingly little disruption. Perhaps for these reasons,regional transportation planners appear to be satisfied with their performance.A national survey ofregional planning agencies,for example,revealed that the majority rated their performanceas acceptable and their models as adequate or better. Only a few, however, had simulated the effects of removing key links from their systems or assuming large and irregular fluctuations in traffic flows in some corridors, such as might occur iftropical storms become more severe or intense pre- cipitation and flooding become more frequent in some regions (Dewar and Wachs 2006). Poor Alignment Between Climate Change Impacts and Transportation Organizational Arrangements The decentralized and modally focused organizational structure of the transportation sector may not align well with climate change impacts, which do not always follow modal,jurisdictional,or corporate boundaries. Sea level rise and flooding from intense precipitation, for example, can affect individual transportation facilities, but they are also likely to have widespread impacts requiring the response of multiple infrastructure providers.Some climate changes,such as more frequent intense tropical storms (Category 4–5 hurricanes),will require regional or even multistate responses that transportation institutions are poorly configured to address.",
        "Challenges to Response 133 Regional planning organizations exist,but regional government does not. Multistate action is difficult,as Hurricane Katrina illustrated. Resource Constraints Climate change poses the possibility of significant, long-lasting impacts on transportation infrastructure and system performance that are likely to be widespread and costly in human and economic terms. Most other challenges confronted by the transportation sector,even extreme weather events such as Hurricane Katrina or earthquakes,cause significant damage, but the effects tend to be local and temporary.By contrast,climate changes in some U.S. regions may necessitate permanent changes. Over time, for example, roads, rail lines, and airport runways in low-lying coastal areas may become casualties of sea level rise,ultimately requiring relocation or expensive protective measures (e.g.,levees,which themselves would be sub- ject to catastrophic failure,as was experienced during Hurricane Katrina). Resistance to Change Transportation planners and engineers typically extrapolate from histor- ical trends to forecast future trends and conditions that influence their investment choices and operating plans. However, the past will not be a reliable guide for future plans and designs as they relate to climate.Climate scientists caution that climate change will usher in a new regime ofweather and climate extremes, likely falling outside the range for which many existing transportation facilities were designed. Faced with a new problem such as this predicted break in trend,trans- portation professionals typically adopt incremental rather than radical solutions.This tendency to favor proven methods and practices is under- standable, particularly for engineers, who are designing infrastructure expected to provide reliable service for decades,and in view of the uncer- tainties about the rate of climate change and the magnitude of its effects. Nevertheless, reinforced by conservative institutions, regulatory require- ments, and limited funding, this way of thinking can hamper timely responses to issues such as climate change that involve risk and uncertainty. Interviews with transportation planning officials conducted for the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (USDOT’s) Gulf Coast study by Cambridge Systematics,Inc.(2006) are illustrative ofprevailing attitudes.",
        "134 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation The interviews were conducted in spring 2006, when the impacts of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were very much on the minds of local plan- ners. Understandably, local officials were concerned with the immediate problems of rebuilding and recovery from the hurricanes. When ques- tioned about the possibility that climate change could bring about more storms of the intensity of Katrina or Rita in the future, however, many local officials expressed skepticism or pleaded ignorance. Others opted for a literal interpretation of SAFETEA-LU’s planning guidance, which does not require consideration of climate change, or pointed to federal policies that allow replacement of facilities only as they are currently designed, preventing consideration of design modifications that could provide for adaptation to potential climate change impacts (e.g.,elevated bridges to accommodate sea level rise, storm surge, and wave action).11 Some officials interviewed believed that Federal Highway Administration regulations prevented them from considering any changes that would extend beyond the time horizon of their long-range plans.12 Still others identified limited current funding that, in combination with uncertain- ties about the rate and timing of projected climate changes, disinclines planners to give more attention to the issue. Lack of Relevant Information Even those transportation professionals who are aware of the importance ofclimate change and are already addressing its impacts,such as the plan- ners and engineers in Alaska who are managing the effects of melting permafrost,indicate that they often lack sufficiently detailed information on which to take appropriate action. Climate scientists tend to describe projected climate changes in terms of global averages and confidence lev- els for global,continental,or large subcontinental regions because climate models have the greatest fidelity at these levels of analysis. In addition, studies ofthe impacts ofclimate change—with the exception ofthe hand- ful of studies reviewed in the previous chapter—have not focused on 11 The Federal Highway Administration, however, has granted exceptions and is rethinking its regulations and guidance for design of bridges in a coastal environment (Meyer 2006). 12 Section 6001 of SAFETEA-LU references a 20-year forecast period for long-range transportation plans. Many states and MPOs, however, are using a 20- to 30-year time horizon.",
        "Challenges to Response 135 transportation specifically,but on other critical sectors,such as agriculture, forestry,energy,and water resources. Transportation professionals need data at the finest-grained level of geographic detail possible because infrastructure is regional and local. Fortunately, the most recent assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) noted the improved capability ofclimate scientists to simulate regional climates and make robust statements about projected climate changes for many regions—a level of geographic speci- ficitythat is more useful to transportation planners and designers.Climate scientists should be encouraged to develop information on transportation- relevant climate changes that is as detailed as possible. Transportation professionals also have a role to play in helping to define what informa- tionabout climate change they need,such as temperature and precipitation thresholds,climate conditions that create unacceptable performance out- comes,and the like. A DECISION FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE How should transportation planners and engineers proceed in view ofthe challenges just outlined? A decision-making framework is needed that more adequately accommodates uncertainty and incorporates more prob- abilistic approaches to assessing risk and making investment choices.The basic concepts in such a probabilistic assessment include hazards,assets,and consequences,each of which is subject to uncertainties (see Annex 4-1).In the context of climate change,the hazards represent the potential threats from changing climate conditions,such as more extreme temperatures or more intense tropical storms.The assets represent the infrastructure and its value—both its economic value to the performance of the transporta- tionsystem and its physical replacement value.The consequences represent the susceptibility of the infrastructure to damage from the hazards,which in turn depends on the infrastructure’s design and state of repair,among other factors.Estimating future risk involves solving for the probability of occurrence of the hazards times the probable consequences if the hazards occurred,summed over all the transportation assets in a region.The objec- tiveis to minimize future risks. Transportation professionals already take risk into account,particularly in designing facilities,and in recent years more probabilistic approaches have been incorporated (Meyer 2006). For example, engineers design",
        "136 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation structures to withstand certain wind speeds on the basis of a probabilis- tic assessment of wind speed occurrence as measured by historical wind speed frequency.The 100-year storm is another example.Engineers often size the drainage capacity ofa transportation facility to handle a storm so severe that it occurs, on average, just once in 100 years. Adapting risk- based approaches to account for climate change poses new challenges. First,historical experience will not be a reliable predictor offuture climate conditions.Second,the hazards themselves are likely to change over time, but in ways that are not currently understood with any precision.Finally, attempting to hedge by simply designing to a more robust standard—say, a higher wind speed tolerance or a 500-year storm—will produce much more costly designs, likely to be unacceptable given limited budgets.13 A more strategic and selective risk-based approach that explicitly trades off the costs of designing for greater resilience against the costs associated with failure could help in setting realistic design standards and invest- ment priorities. California’s seismic retrofit program for bridges is an example of one way to proceed (see Box 4-1). Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989,the state was faced with the daunting task of how best to retrofit its stock of some 25,000 bridges. Earthquakes are a recurring problem, but there is considerable uncertainty about when or where a seismic event will occur.Moreover,the resources needed to retrofit every bridge to the highest standard or to conduct a physical inventory of all structures to determine which need to be retrofit are not available. The California Department of Transportation decided to proceed in the following man- ner.First,departmental engineers determined an acceptable performance standard or level of risk, reducing one of the uncertainties. For most bridges,that standard was “no collapse”under a maximum seismic event, consistent with the geographic location of the bridge.The objective was to avoid loss of life.However,some damage to the structure was accept- able as long as the structure itself remained intact and could be reopened 13 The committee is aware of the precautionary principle, which holds that “where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, the lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation” (UNEP 1992 in Whiteside 2006). The committee recommends that cost-effective measures to protect the more vulnerable transportation infrastructure be taken. However, the significant costs of redesigning and retrofitting much of the infrastructure to adapt to potential climate change impacts underscore the need for more strategic and selective risk-based analyses.",
        "Challenges to Response 137 BOX 4-1 California Seismic Retrofit Program for Bridges Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) faced the enormous task of prioritizing its inventory of structures throughout the state for seismic retrofit. Approximately 25,000 bridges on state and local highways required evaluation. Because of this large number of bridges, a simple and computationally manageable prioriti- zation methodology had to be devised. The goal was to identify and rank the most seismically vulnerable bridges in the state so the available resources could be used in the most efficient manner possible. The process began with establishing a required performance standard. For most bridges, the minimum standard was “no collapse” during a major seismic event to prevent loss of life. However, damage to the structure was acceptable provided that the structure itself remained intact and could be reopened for service soon after the event. The exceptions to the “no col- lapse” requirement were 750 structures for which the highest level of performance was desirable to protect the substantial investment in these major structures and ensure that they would remain in service after a major seismic event to provide access for emergency responders. The 11 major toll bridges, including the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, were handled sep- arately because their complexity necessitated a time-consuming dynamic analysis. A risk algorithm was developed for screening of the nontoll bridges. This algorithm was based on four major evaluation criteria: seismic activity, seis- mic hazard, impact, and vulnerability. Seismic activity was determined by locating structures in one of four fault activity zones, ranked from highly to minimally active. Seismic hazard was determined on the basis of specific conditions (e.g., soil) at the bridge site. Impact was based on such attri- butes as average daily traffic, route type, and detour length. Vulnerability was assessed on the basis of structural characteristics (e.g., structure type, structure age, presence of expansion joints) to assess the risk to the struc- ture itself. The score on each criterion was multiplied by a weighting factor—seismic activity and hazard were weighted more heavily—and summed with those on the other criteria to arrive at a final score. All 12,600 state highway bridges were processed by using this screening procedure and were prioritized by score. (The 750 major structures were flagged to be in the program.) Additional screening was required for 7,000 (continued)",
        "138 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX4-1 (continued) California Seismic Retrofit Program for Bridges bridges that failed to meet the minimum performance standard. These bridges were reviewed for specific deficiencies through an examination of the as-built plans for each. The second “paper” screening was used to determine whether the bridge was in the program or retrofit could be deferred; the goal was to make the program more manageable while still addressing the most urgent needs given the available resources. As a result of this second screening, 2,194 bridges were found to be in need of retrofit and were programmed for improvement. A final in-depth field inspection was performed, with the result that some bridges were found to meet the “no collapse” requirement and were removed from the list. A similar procedure was followed for the 12,400 local roadway bridges, resulting in 4,500 structures that required further evaluation and analysis. Since the program was initiated, 2,194 bridges on the state highway sys- tem have been retrofit at a cost of $3 billion, and the program is considered 99 percent complete. The remaining phase of the program consists of retro- fitting 1,235 bridges on local roadways at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion; the program for local bridges is about 60 percent complete. Funding is pro- vided through a combination of local funds, state gas tax revenues, statewide bond initiatives, and federal funds. Caltrans has maintained ongoing assessment of the seismic retrofit needs of its bridge inventory to identify structures with potential seismic vulnerabilities based on lessons learned since the program’s inception. The bridges identified through this process are prioritized and added to the program as required. State and local governments and private infrastructure providers could adopt a similar approach for identifying and screening critical infrastructure relative to projected climate changes. Key to adopting such an approach is establishing a performance standard for a particular facility that reflects a tolerable level of risk (a “no collapse” equivalent), along with a screening process that takes into consideration such factors as the degree of risk (e.g., magnitude of the hazard), the vulnerability of the facility, and how essential the facility is to the system so priorities for rehabilitation or retrofit can be determined.

        "Challenges to Response 139 for service soon after the event. The exceptions were 750 structures on state highways and 11 major toll bridges, which were held to a higher standard both to protect the substantial investment in these major struc- tures and to ensure that these vital transportation lifelines would remain in service following a major seismic event to provide access for emergency responders.Second,the experts devised a layered screening system to rate the structures most in need of retrofit; an in-depth physical inventory was conducted only for those bridges that did not meet the performance standard. Finally, elected officials were brought on board, and a combi- nation of funds—federal grants, state gas tax and bond funds, and local revenues—was employed to implement a long-term investment program that continues to this day. State and local transportation officials could adopt a similar approach to assess how climate change may affect transportation assets and develop appropriate adaptation responses and investment strategies.To begin,they might ask the following questions: • Which projected climate changes are most relevant for their region? • How are climate change hazards likely to be manifested (e.g.,flood- ing,storm surge coupled with sea level rise)? • Which transportation assets may be affected? • How severe must a hazard be before it becomes relevant and action is required? Can thresholds be identified? • How likely is it that a projected hazard will exceed the threshold, when,and where? • How much risk can be tolerated,or in other words,what infra- structure performance level is tolerable? • What level of investment (capital and operating) is needed to maintain different levels of service? Can acceptable performance standards for all modes of transportation be established? • Are there critical levels of service needed to protect health and safety? • Who is empowered to make these judgments and decisions? • What are the risks of adverse impacts or consequences if no action is taken?",

Assess how climate changes are likely to affect various regions of the country and modes of transportation (assess hazards). 2. Inventory transportation infrastructure essential to maintaining network performance in light of climate change projections to determine whether, when, and where the impacts of projected changes could be consequen- tial (assess the vulnerability of assets and the system’s resilience to loss of assets). 3. Analyze adaptation options to assess the trade-offs between making the infrastructure more robust and the costs involved. Consider monitoring as an option. 4. Determine investment priorities, taking into consideration the criticality of the infrastructure component as well as opportunities for multiple ben- efits (e.g., congestion relief, removal of evacuation route bottlenecks). 5. Develop and implement a program of adaptation strategies for the near and long terms. 6. Periodically assess the effectiveness of adaptation strategies, and repeat Steps 1 through 5. • If action is necessary,how will investment priorities be determined? • Who will make the necessary investments,and how will they be funded? Answers to many of these questions can be found by following the six steps set forth in Box 4-2. This approach provides guidance on how to proceed in addressing many of the technical questions previously posed. However, it does not cover relevant organizational and political issues. Transportation officials must communicate the results of their technical analyses to senior management and elected officials,who make the policy decisions that guide funding choices.In the California situation,the Loma Prieta earthquake focused attention on the need for seismic retrofit of many of the bridges throughout the state to avoid catastrophic failure and loss oflife from such an event in the future.With climate changes,however, the impacts will not always be as unambiguously attributable to those",

FINDINGS Climate change poses a complex set of problems, associated risks, and uncertainties with which transportation planners and decision makers are unfamiliar.Among the characteristics of climate change that make it particularly difficult to tackle are uncertainties about the rate and extent ofprojected changes;the fact that climate change impacts may not follow the modal,jurisdictional,or corporate boundaries of the transportation sector; and the fact that impacts may require coordinated regional or multistate responses that infrastructure providers are poorly configured to address. The significant costs of designing infrastructure to allow for adaptation to long-term climate change impacts in the face of resource constraints, the tendency of transportation planners and engineers to extrapolate from the past and adopt incremental solutions when ap- proaching new problems, and the lack of relevant information and guidance on which to base appropriate actions also affect how trans- portation planners and engineers view climate change. A change in perspective is needed. First, transportation professionals must recognize climate change as a credible and important problem so that champions will emerge to bring attention to the issue and to make col- laboration with climate scientists and meteorologists a priority. Second, addressing climate change requires a longer-term perspective and recog- nition that investment decisions made today, particularly about the location of transportation infrastructure, help shape long-term develop- ment patterns and markets well beyond the 30-year time frames of many public-sector capital improvement plans and private-sector capital budget- ing analyses.These decisions also affect how well the transportation system will adapt to climate change in the near and long terms.Third,the signifi- cant costs ofredesigning,retrofitting,and potentially having to relocate (or protect at great expense) some transportation infrastructure to adapt to potential impacts of climate change suggest the need for more strategic, risk-based approaches to decision making and infrastructure design.Such",
        "142 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation approaches should be better oriented to assessing the trade-offs between the costs of investments to make the infrastructure more robust and the likelihood and costs of facility failures or major disruptions to the system. The results of such assessments should be presented in a form that can be communicated to senior management and elected officials as a prudent action program, and provision should be made for adjustments as new knowledge becomes available. Finally, addressing the impacts of climate change that require regional and multistate responses is likely to entail developing new coalitions and organizational arrangements.Many ofthese changes will take time.Fortunately,transportation professionals have many avenues through which to begin to develop adaptation strategies,the topic of the next chapter.

        "ANNEX 4-1 Applying Probabilistic Risk Assessment to Climate Change and Transportation P robabilistic risk assessment (PRA) is a comprehensive,well-developed methodology for evaluating risks so they can be prioritized and managed more effectively. Properly applied, PRA will likely prove an indispensable tool for transportation managers considering the potential impacts of climate change. CLASSIC RISK ASSESSMENT The central idea behind PRA is to define risk as the product of the magni- tude of adverse consequences and the probability that those consequences will occur.For instance,the risk ofthe loss ofa coastal road due to a storm surge would be the likelihood of a storm surge rising high enough to in- undate the road,multiplied by both the dollar cost ofreplacing the flooded road and the costs ofthe economic disruption during the time the road was unusable. In principle,transportation managers could use this risk definition to thoroughly assess the risks posed by climate change for their system.They could list the full range ofhazards associated with climate change for their region (e.g., sea level rise, heat) and then estimate the consequences that each hazard, if it occurred, would have for each transportation asset in their region.Each component ofthis equation has an associated probabil- ity.Thus,for example,there is a certain annual probability of occurrence for a 5-foot, 10-foot, or 20-foot storm surge; a certain probability that a road would fail if confronted by a 5-foot,10-foot,or 20-foot storm surge; and a certain probability that the economic costs of such a failure would be $1 million,$5 million,or $10 million. 143",
        "144 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation In sum,the risk due to climate change for all the assets in a manager’s system would be given by Totalrisk = ∑ Prob(hazard)×Prob(consequence) alllassets, allhazards where the first term represents the probability densities for each hazard and the second term represents the probability densities for the costs of each hazard (including the probability and the cost of failure) for each asset in the transportation system. Carrying out this analysis would provide transportation managers with an estimate oftheir total risk and the most important sources ofthat risk. (In practice, the probability of hazard is time dependent, and any future consequences for long-lived infrastructure would be discounted. However,this simplified expression is sufficient for the discussion below.) Note that the same contribution to risk can be made by a hazard with a relatively high probability of occurrence but moderate consequences and a hazard with a relatively low probability ofoccurrence but relatively high consequences. Such information provides a solid foundation for deter- mining the most effective ways to manage the risk. CHALLENGES OF ASSESSING THE RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR TRANSPORTATION ASSETS AND SYSTEMS In practice,it is difficult to carry out this calculation in its complete form. First,all the necessary data on the likelihood of the various hazards and their economic consequences may not be available. Second, significant uncertainty may be associated with the data that are available. Decision and risk analysts often distinguish between risk and uncertainty. In the former,knowledge of future events can be well characterized by proba- bility distributions.In the latter,decision makers may not view the best available probability distributions as very reliable. For instance, if trans- portation managers were completely confident that the climate is not changing,they might have high confidence in estimates of the probabil- ity ofmoderate-probability hazards,that is,those expected to occur every 10 years or less as gleaned from weather records for their region extend- ing back several decades or more. Managers might regard estimates of low-probability hazards, that is, those expected to occur every century, as less reliable. However, transportation managers have little basis for",
        "Challenges to Response 145 assuming that estimates of future climate-related hazards gleaned from past weather records in their region can serve as good estimates of the future likelihood of such events. They need to adjust their expectations on the basis of the results of probabilistic projections from climate mod- els.As discussed in Chapter 2,some hazard estimates from such models, in particular, estimates of the likelihood of extreme events, may be less reliable than others. The final reason that a comprehensive probabilistic risk assessment would prove difficult is that many transportation assets are long-lived, many of the most important impacts of climate change are expected to increase over time, and future transportation managers may take steps that can reduce (or perhaps unintentionally increase) the consequences of future climate changes.To address such changes over time,those who study the impacts of climate change identify four key factors that charac- terize the ability of a system to adjust to climate change.Using a slightly different language drawn from the ecological and biological literatures as opposed to the engineering literature of formal probabilistic risk assess- ment, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines these factors as follows: • Exposure,defined as the manner and degree to which a system is exposed to significant climate variations; • Vulnerability,defined as the potential for loss,or the degree to which a system is susceptible to or unable to cope with adverse effects of climate change; • Resilience,which refers to the restorative or regenerative capacity of a system when faced with change;and • Adaptation,defined as the adjustment made to a system in response to actual or expected climate change to mitigate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. Exposure and vulnerability are similar to hazards and consequences. System-level resilience is a particularly important concept in the trans- portation sector because individual assets function as components of a network.The consequences ofdamage to any one asset will depend on the ability of traffic to reroute by using other routes or modes.They will also depend on the speed with which the affected private transportation providers and public agencies (e.g.,state and local governments) can react",
        "146 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation and bring resources to bear to restore damaged systems to service. The resilience, or lack thereof, of the system can thus reduce or increase the consequences of damage to individual assets in the system. Adaptation will also be an important component of transportation managers’ ability to manage future risks associated with climate change. Managers today do not need to address the full range ofpotential impacts of future climate change because they can reasonably assume that future managers will take prudent steps to reduce the vulnerability oftheir assets and increase the resilience oftheir systems.However,some decisions made today can have implications that might make adaptation actions by future managers significantly more or less effective. For instance, some choices regarding the design and location of new transportation infrastructure may make it easier and less costly for future managers to adapt to climate changes if those changes turn out to be larger than currently expected.If there are two otherwise similar locations for a new road, for example, locating it farther from the coast will make it less costly for future man- agers to address any vulnerabilities of the asset should sea level rise turn out to be larger than currently expected. CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION MANAGERS IN PRACTICE The above factors—lack of complete data,uncertainty about the reliabil- ity of projections of future climate change, and uncertainty about the actions future managers will take to reduce the vulnerability and increase the resilience of a transportation system—make it difficult to conduct a comprehensive probabilistic risk analysis for a regional transportation system.In future years,more comprehensive planning frameworks can be expected to come into use that will help transportation managers inte- grate consideration of exposure,vulnerability,resilience,and adaptation factors.In the near term,however,a number of convenient and relatively simple methods can facilitate transportation managers’incorporation of these risk assessment concepts into their planning. For instance, the California Seismic Retrofit Program (see Box 4-1) provides an example of a simple screening analysis,based on the concepts of probabilistic risk analysis, that allowed the California Department of Transportation to prioritize seismic retrofit investments for approximately 25,000 bridges on state and local highways.The screening criteria focused",
        "Challenges to Response 147 on both the vulnerability of individual assets and the resilience of the sys- tem.For instance,the program prescribed a higher performance standard for 11 major toll bridges,such as the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, whose loss would cause major economic disruption and whose replace- ment would be extremely expensive. Transportation planners can address the potential for future system adaptation by time windows. For instance, operational decisions will be focused on near-term changes in weather and climate conditions,such as more frequent and more extreme events (e.g., intense precipitation and flooding),with which transportation operators are already familiar.Retrofit decisions will determine the performance of assets for several decades and thus should use probabilistic climate forecasts that extend out for several decades to estimate hazards. Finally, land use and location deci- sions for new infrastructure may influence transportation systems for a century or more, so managers should use probabilistic climate projec- tions for future climate conditions extending into the 22nd century.The decision framework described in Box 4-2 provides one way to incorpo- rate such considerations. ROBUSTNESS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Particularly when they use multidecadal and century-scale climate projec- tions,transportation managers should pay heed to potentially significant uncertainties in these estimates.In particular,when transportation man- agers use probabilistic risk assessments to compare alternative design choices or even when they conduct a screening analysis,they should be aware of choices or rankings that are especially sensitive to particular probabilistic estimates.Engineers commonly incorporate safety factors into designs or design standards to account for unforeseen events or abnormal forces on structures.Similarly,transportation managers should recognize that it may be difficult for climate change projections to distinguish a future 100-year storm from a future 500-year storm,or that estimates of the likelihood that sea level rise will exceed 1 m by 2100 may change sig- nificantly in the years ahead. To the extent that they can make location decisions and design choices that account for such uncertainties in their risk assessments, today’s transportation managers will help future stew- ards of their systems minimize avoidable surprises.",
        "5 Meeting the Challenges A daptation to climate change would be necessary even if drastic mitigation measures were taken immediately to stabilize or even eliminate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (IPCC 2007).The effects of such global climate changes as warming temperatures and sea level rise occurring today reflect emissions of GHGs released into the atmosphere over the past century.Because ofthese long-lasting effects,the actions taken by transportation professionals today have implications for how the trans- portation system will respond to climate change in the near and long terms. The first section of this chapter is organized on the basis of timescales that transportation decision makers must consider in determining how best to adapt to climate change. In the short term (i.e., the next several decades), transportation professionals are likely to have operational responses to changing climate conditions and climate extremes.Operators of transportation systems already react to many climate changes,particu- larly extreme events (e.g., intense precipitation, intense tropical storms) and can rapidly adapt operating and maintenance practices for those cli- mate conditions projected to increase in frequency or intensity. Rehabilitating or retrofitting infrastructure requires a longer time hori- zon because engineers design many infrastructure facilities with long service lives in mind (see Chapter 4), thereby providing fewer opportunities for adapting to changing climate conditions without incurring significant costs. Adapting facilities for climate change may also involve the reevaluation and development of design standards—a process that typically entails a lengthy research and testing program. Finally, constructing new transportation infrastructure or providing major additions to existing transportation systems requires the longest time horizon. Transportation systems shape land use and development 148",
        "Meeting the Challenges 149 patterns, and in turn, population growth and economic development stimulate demand for new infrastructure facilities to support growth.In both cases,decisions made today about where to locate or expand trans- portation infrastructure establish development patterns that persist for generations and are difficult to change.These decisions should be weighed carefully to ensure that people and businesses are not placed in harm’s way as projected climate changes unfold. Following discussion of these topics,the chapter turns to many cross- cutting issues—flood insurance; monitoring technologies and new materials;data,models,and decision support tools;and new partnerships and organizational arrangements—that can help facilitate adaptation to climate change or bring climate change issues into the decision-making process.The chapter ends with the committee’s findings. ADAPTATION STRATEGIES Annexes 5-1A through 5-1C summarize a wide range of adaptation mea- sures that can be used to address many of the climate change impacts discussed in Chapter 3 (see Annex 3-1).Potential adaptations are identi- fied for land, marine, and air transportation, respectively, by response category: (a) changes in operations, (b) changes in infrastructure design and materials, and (c) other. No attempt is made to estimate the relative costs or effectiveness of these measures, although such analyses would be necessary to evaluate specific infrastructure investment alternatives. The remainder of this section addresses the key issues and opportunities for adaptation in each response category. Operational Responses The most rapid response to the impacts ofclimate change is likely to come through changes in transportation operating and maintenance practices.1 Every U.S.transportation provider already experiences the adverse impacts of weather on operations under a diverse range of climate conditions.For example, approximately 75 percent of air travel delays in the National Airspace System are weather related (L.Maurice and M.Gupta,presenta- tion to the committee, Jan. 4, 2007). Slick pavement and adverse weather 1 This section draws heavily on the paper by Lockwood (2006) commissioned for this study.",
        "150 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation contribute to nearly one-quarter of all highway crashes and about 7,400 fatalities annually.2In addition,snow,ice,rain,and fog cause about 15 per- cent of total delays on the nation’s highways (FHWA 2004; NRC 2004b). Weather also causes delays and interruptions in service for railroad and marine transportation.3 Transportation agencies expend considerable resources to address these conditions. For example, snow and ice control accounts for about 40 percent ofannual highway operating budgets in snowbelt states (FHWA 2006a).Hurricane response is a major focus of transportation operations in states bordering the Gulf Coast.Collaboration between departments of transportation (DOTs) and emergency response personnel has improved, particularly in those areas of the country subject to recurring natural disasters—the Gulf Coast (hurricanes) and California (earthquakes and wildfires)—but still has a long way to go. Climate change is altering the frequency,intensity,and incidence of weather events. Changes in Frequency ofExtreme Weather Events With changes in the frequency of extreme weather events, operational responses treated today on an ad hoc,emergency basis are likely to become part of mainstream operations. One could imagine, for example, that if strong (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes increased in frequency as is likely, widespread establishment of evacuation routes and use of contraflow operations4 in affected areas might become as commonplace as snow emergency routes in the Northeast and Midwest. Mainstreaming such responses will require expanding the scope of the traditional operating focus of DOTs on traffic and incident management to include weather management,as well as improved training for operating personnel. Increases in Intensity ofWeather Events Climate change is expected to trigger more extreme weather events,such as more intense precipitation,which are likely to produce areawide emergen- 2 Based on averages from 1995–2004 data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and analyzed by Mitretek Systems. 3 See, for example, Changnon (2006) on the impacts of weather and climate on American railroading and a report by the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research on the impacts of weather on surface transportation modes (OFCM 2002). 4 Contraflow involves the reversal of traffic flow on one or more of the inbound lanes and shoulders of roads and highways for use in the outbound direction to increase evacuation capacity in an emergency by using both sides of a roadway.",

Operators of transportation systems also need to work more closely with weather forecasters and emergency response planners to convey their own lead-time requirements for providing the necessary personnel and equipment in an evacuation and protecting their own assets.Finally,a greater emphasis on emergency management as a separate functional responsibility within DOTs and other transportation providers is needed. Regional transportation management centers (TMCs) provide one location through which collaboration between transportation providers and emergency managers can occur (see Box 5-1). TMCs are currently focused on traffic monitoring and incident management through rapid deployment of police,fire and rescue,and emergency medical services.In some metropolitan areas, new functions are being added, such as better weather information and greater use ofreal-time traffic advisories,as well as links with emergency managers.Some TMCs are also serving as EOCs. However, integration of weather and emergency management functions in TMCs is still in its infancy according to a recent U.S. Department of Transportation assessment (FHWA 2006b). Changes in Incidence ofWeather Patterns Climate changes will bring new weather patterns to previously unaffected areas of the United States. These changes, however, may not necessarily require the development of new operating and maintenance strategies. The United States has a diverse climate,ranging from subtropical to arctic",
        "152 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX 5-1 Transportation Management Centers Improving the efficiency of the existing highway network involves the appli- cation of technologies, such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and control strategies, such as ramp metering, dynamic message signs, and incident management. In many large metropolitan areas, these devel- opments have been accompanied by establishment of regional transportation management centers (TMCs), which are seen as the cockpit or nerve center for monitoring traffic incidents and providing rapid police response, crash clearance, and travel advisories. Many TMCs are manned by staff from mul- tiple agencies and jurisdictions working as a team. Some TMCs are focused primarily on traffic and incident management. Others, such as Houston TranStar, have a broader scope. Opened in 1996, Houston TranStar is a consortium partnership of transportation and emer- gency management agencies in the greater Houston area housing engineers, law enforcement personnel, information technology specialists, and emer- gency managers. In addition to traffic monitoring and incident control, emergency management personnel from the Harris County Office of Emer- gency Management monitor potential emergencies due to severe weather using state-of-the-art technology, such as flood warning monitors, Doppler radar, satellite imagery, and weather data from the National Weather Service, to provide the public with real-time information. The city of Chicago recently opened a new City Incident Center (CIC), which integrates the city’s homeland security efforts with traffic services, among other activities. CIC follows on the creation of a Traffic Management Authority in 2005, dedicated to improving traffic flow through ITS technol- ogy and centralized control systems. The new facility will have positions dedicated to traffic management but will also provide a central location for communication among dispatch operators from all the relevant city depart- ments so they can respond rapidly and effectively in the event of an emergency (Inside ITS2006). and from arid to wet, with several regions being subject to temperature extremes and such events as blizzards,hurricanes,tornadoes,floods,wild- fires, avalanches, and mudslides.As climate patterns change, the transfer of best practices from one location to another will be essential.A mecha- nism is needed to encourage such information exchange, involving all",

This effort should build on existing technology transfer mechanisms, such as the Technology Implementation Group of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).5 Design Strategies Operational responses are geared to addressing near-term impacts of climate change. To make decisions today about rehabilitating or retro- fitting transportation facilities, especially those with long design lives (see Table 4-2 in the previous chapter), transportation planners and engineers must consider how climate changes will affect these facilities 50 years or more from now.Adapting to climate change will also require reevaluation, development, and regular updating of design standards that guide infrastructure design. The purpose ofdesign standards is to provide engineers with guidance on how to construct infrastructure for safe and reliable performance.6 These standards represent the uniform application ofthe best engineering knowledge, developed through years of experimental study and actual experience.Often they become embedded in regulatory requirements and funding programs.7 Design standards embody trade-offs between per- formance (e.g.,safety,reliability) and cost.Faced with a myriad of factors that can affect performance,engineers typically select the most demand- ing parameter—the 100-year storm,the heaviest truck,the most powerful wind speed—as the basis for design,thereby building in a safety margin to minimize the chances of failure. Environmental factors are integral to the design of transportation infrastructure.Conditions such as temperature,freeze–thaw cycles,and duration and intensity of precipitation determine subsurface and founda- 5 The primary objective of AASHTO’s Technology Implementation Group, which grew out of an AASHTO task force’s successful effort to implement products of the Strategic Highway Research Program, is to provide leadership to state DOTs, local governments, and industry in the selection and promotion of ready-to-implement technologies. 6 This section draws heavily on the paper by Meyer (2006) commissioned for this study. 7 To be eligible for federal funding, for example, state and local governments must comply with federal standards with respect to lane and shoulder widths on highways and bridge clearances over navigable waterways. If the infrastructure is damaged or destroyed, federal agencies and insurers typically allow renovation or rebuilding only to replacement standards; upgrading is not a reimbursable cost.",

The issue is whether current design standards are adequate to accommodate the cli- mate changes projected by scientists.Table 5-1 provides an assessment by Meyer (2006) of the principal climate-induced changes and their implica- tions for infrastructure design in both the short and long terms.Looking across all climate changes,the author notes that the most dominant impact is on those design elements most associated with forces resulting from water flows.This finding is not surprising in view of the extensive damage to transportation infrastructure and buildings caused by flooding and storm surge in Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Climate changes, however, will not affect the design of all infrastructure modes equally, a second important observation. For example, wave action is more critical than temperature changes for coastal bridge design. Finally, climate extremes, such as stronger wind speeds, increased storm surges, and greater wave heights,will place the greatest demands on infrastructure because they are likely to push the limits of the performance range for which facilities were designed. How should engineering design decisions be modified to address cli- mate change, particularly for longer-lived infrastructure for which the uncertainties are greater regarding the magnitude and timing of climate changes? One option is to build to a more robust standard, assuming a greater frequency and magnitude of extreme events,without a full under- standing offuture risks and presumably at greater cost.This strategy could be appropriate for major facilities in vulnerable locations (e.g., critical bridges and evacuation routes), but its high costs necessitate a highly selective approach. Another option is to upgrade parallel routes, but this alternative depends on the availability of right-of-way and the cost of upgrading.A third option is to build infrastructure with shorter design lives,presumably at lower cost,to be retrofitted as more knowledge about future climate conditions is gained.This alternative probably is not viable in the United States because ofthe disruption and negative public reaction resulting from more frequent retrofits of major facilities. Most states are adopting a “fast in,fast out,and stay out”approach to major reconstruc- tion projects.A final option is to hedge by building to current standards or making marginal improvements, recognizing that the infrastructure remains at risk and may require major improvements in the future.This alternative poses many of the same problems as the previous one.All four options involve important cost–risk reduction trade-offs that engineers",

        "156 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation and planners can best address through a more strategic, risk-based approach to design and investment decisions,such as that described in the previous chapter. The approach taken by Transit New Zealand to deter- mine the necessity and feasibility of taking action now to protect the state highway network from the potential future impacts of climate change could also be instructive (see Box 5-2). More fundamentally,the scientific community and professional associ- ations must reevaluate design standards for transportation infrastructure that take climate change into account and begin the lengthy process of developing new standards where appropriate. Reexamination of design standards can be prompted by a single event,such as the damage to coastal highway bridges from Hurricane Katrina,when it became evident that the current state of practice—designing bridges for a riverine environment and a 50-year storm—was inadequate. The Federal Highway Admin- istration (FHWA) not only approved and shared in the cost of rebuilding the damaged bridges to a higher design standard but also recommended the development of more appropriate bridge design standards in general for a coastal environment that would take into account the combined effects of storm surge and wave action and assume a more severe storm event (e.g.,a 100-year or even 500-year storm) (FHWA 2005a).8 Typically, however, the development of design standards follows a time-consuming and systematic process that involves professional organi- zations in an extensive research and testing program over a period of decades. Once the standards are in place, engineers are understandably reluctant to change them.A combination of the length of time required to modify or develop new standards,the institutional procedures for approval of standards (vetting any changes through professional committees of practicing engineers), and the use of well-established standards as evi- dence of“good practice”in litigation leads to a conservative approach to change. Developing standards to address climate change in a timely manner thus will require leadership by the scientific community and professional associations and, given the scope of potential impacts, a broad-based,federally sponsored research program that must begin soon. A good model is the congressionally mandated National Earthquake 8 AASHTO and state DOTs are leading this initiative, and research on wave forces and wave load design practices is now being undertaken by universities and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Turner–Fairbank Highway Research Center, among others.",

The key climate changes of concern to state highways are sea level rise, coastal storm surges, and increased frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events. The primary assets at risk are bridges, culverts, causeways and coastal roads, pavement sur- faces, surface drainage, and hillside slopes. Transit New Zealand proceeded with a two-stage assessment to identify those areas requiring action. Stage 1 involved assessing the need to act now to manage future potential impacts of climate change. Three criteria were used: • Level of certainty that the climate change impact will occur at the magnitude predicted in the specified time frame, • Intended design life of the state highway asset, and • Capacity of the agency’s current asset management practice to man- age the impact. The results of the Stage 1 assessment revealed that current asset manage- ment practice is generally adequate to deal with impacts of climate change for most of the network, but that bridges and culverts with an intended design life of more than 25 years may require case-by-case consideration to ensure protection (Kinsella and McGuire 2005). Stage 2 involved assessing the economic feasibility of acting now to man- age future potential impacts of climate change and was focused on bridges and culverts with design lives of greater than 25 years. Making several sim- plifying assumptions, the analysis examined three options: (a) doing nothing, (b) retrofitting all existing bridges and culverts now to avoid future climate change impacts, and (c) designing all new bridges and culverts to accommo- date future climate changes to 2080. The analysis revealed that it would not be economical to retrofit the existing stock of bridges and culverts, but it (continued)",

The primary reasons for this conclusion were uncertainties about where and when the impacts of climate change will manifest themselves and the historical number of bridges and culverts lost prematurely because of other events. Retrofitting all new bridges and culverts to take climate change into account was also determined not to be economical. Nevertheless, the agency decided that, where possible, provision should be made for subse- quent retrofitting (either lifting or lengthening the bridge) in the event impacts are experienced. For major bridges (and culverts) where retrofitting is not practical, the structure should be designed for projected future impacts of cli- mate change on the basis of the best available information (Kinsella and McGuire 2005). Transit New Zealand has amended its Bridge Manualto include consid- eration of relevant impacts of climate change as a design factor.

Hazard Reduction Program,begun in 1977,which has provided much of the underlying research for seismic standards (see Box 5-3). New Infrastructure Investment, Transportation Planning, and Controls on Land Use One ofthe most effective strategies for reducing the risks ofclimate change is to avoid placing people and infrastructure in vulnerable locations,such as coastal areas.Chapter 3 described the continuing development pressures on coastal counties despite the increased risk offlooding and damage from storm surge and wave action accompanying projected rising sea levels. Many areas along the Atlantic,Gulf,and Pacific coasts will be affected.Once in place, settlement patterns and supporting infrastructure are difficult to change. In New York City, for example, a major concern of emergency planners is handling the evacuation ofsome 2.3 million New Yorkers from flood-prone areas in the event of a Category 3 or greater hurricane (New York City Transit 2007).Continued development of such vulnerable areas",
        "Meeting the Challenges 159 BOX 5-3 Development of Seismic Standards in the United States In 1977 Congress passed the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act, which established the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP)— a long-term earthquake risk reduction program. Member agencies include the United States Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology—agencies engaged primarily in research and development. The mission of NEHRP is broad and includes understanding the science of earthquakes and their effects, improving earthquake hazard identification and risk assessment methods, and developing effective prac- tices (e.g., model building codes) and policies to reduce earthquake losses (NEHRP 2007). One of the primary accomplishments of NEHRP has been the develop- ment of design standards for the seismic safety of buildings, both new and existing, which serve as a basis for national model building codes. Seismic standards and guidelines have also been developed for lifelines— telecommunications, transportation, water, sewage, electric power, gas, and liquid fuel lines. Adoption of the standards is voluntary, but some states, such as California, have incorporated the model national codes into state regulations, and the federal government has adopted the standards for its own buildings and as a prerequisite for obtaining federal funds. FHWA, for example, requires that federally assisted bridge and highway projects meet minimum seismic standards. The development of seismic specifications for bridges began in the 1970s with the San Fernando earthquake and was spurred by the occurrence of sub- sequent major earthquakes. For example, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake led the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to adopt a standard seismic specification for bridges in 1990. In response to the limitations of a “one-size-fits-all” approach, a modified performance- based standard was proposed in 1997, but it was rejected as being too complex and having too high a return frequency (2,500 years) relative to other hazards (Buckle 2006). (A performance-based national consensus standard has been developed for buildings.) Nevertheless, revisions are under way, and the performance-based approach, which takes into account different performance requirements and levels of risk, could be a model for the development of standards to address the impacts of climate change. A program such as NEHRP would be essential to fund the necessary support- ing research and testing.",
        "160 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation will only place more communities and businesses at risk and increase the difficulty of evacuation in the event of a major storm. Why do transportation planners fail to consider development patterns in making investment decisions? The short answer is that they do,but not from the perspective of land use control. Public-sector transportation planners typically forecast expected land use patterns over a 25- to 30-year period as the basis for modeling future travel demand and infrastructure investment needs (Meyer and Miller 2001).However,they rarely consider whether such investments are desirable, or what development may result from building or expanding transportation networks (Amekudzi and Meyer 2005).9Although the long-term capital improvement and budgeting process is different in the private sector (see Chapter 4),it suffers from the same limitations. One of the main reasons for the disconnect between transportation investment decisions and land use and development deci- sions can be traced to governance arrangements. Decisions concerning large-scale transportation infrastructure investments are the responsibility ofstates,regional authorities,and the private sector.Local governments and a few states (e.g.,Florida,California) control land use decisions through comprehensive plans, zoning ordinances, permitting, and building codes. Locally controlled land use planning, the typical situation in the United States,has too limited a perspective to account for the broadly shared risks of climate change. Local governments are interested primarily in the jobs and economic development that growth may bring to their communities, although in many localities, the costs of uncontrolled growth in terms of crowded roads and schools are being recognized.In some locations,greater integration oftransportation and land use planning is resulting from smart growth policies,which recognize the impact oftransportation investments on regional development and economic growth and vice versa; such inte- gration is not common,however. Transportation planners cannot resolve these issues single-handedly. The developers ofany strategy that involves imposing land use controls to address climate change would need to build consensus among key deci- sion makers in both transportation and land use,probably at the regional level—a challenging proposition.Nevertheless,if transportation planners 9 Meyer (2006) notes two locations—Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts—where transportation planners have identified environmentally sensitive areas that are off limits to new infrastructure and development, but these are the exceptions rather than the rule.",
        "Meeting the Challenges 161 were required to work more closely with land use planners and consider potential impacts ofclimate change in the development oflong-term invest- ment plans,the issues would become more visible. At present, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act:A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) encourages greater collab- oration and partnership among transportation planners and state and local agencies responsible for land use management, among others, in plan development.10 In the reauthorization of this legislation, such collabora- tion should be required,as should consideration ofclimate change impacts and their effects on infrastructure plans and investments, particularly in vulnerable locations. At the local level, some metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) have already begun to adopt more flexible, scenario-based approaches in developing their long-range transportation investment plans (see Box 5-4). The impetus has come in part from the desire to provide local communities with a framework within which to better understand the impacts ofgrowth and the difficult trade-offs among social, economic, and environmental goals in planning future transportation investments. Use of geographic information systems and modeling has enabled planners to illustrate and quantify the impacts ofa range ofregional growth scenarios on land use and area traffic,among other factors.At the end ofthe planning process,one sce- nario typically is selected as the preferred option. Development and monitoring of performance measures enable local planners to examine the effects oftheir choices and revisit the plans periodically to take into account new developments and changes in local priorities. Scenario planning could be adapted to take potential climate changes into account in the development of future regional transportation plans. For example,projections of current development patterns and supporting transportation infrastructure,when overlaid on maps showing current ele- vations and expected sea level rise, could illustrate the increased risks of allowing uncontrolled development in vulnerable coastal areas and the desirability of managed growth policies and protection of critical infra- structure.Climate scientists,perhaps at local universities,could assist in the 10 More specifically, Section 6001 and the Final Rule on Statewide and Metropolitan Transportation Planning (Federal Register2007) require that long-range transportation plans be developed in consultation with agencies responsible for land use management, natural resources, environmental protection, conservation, and historic preservation, and that state conservation plans or maps and inventories of natural or historic resources be consulted.",
        "162 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation BOX 5-4 Scenario Analysis in Transportation Planning Scenario analysis as practiced by transportation planners is a process through which public agencies, private entities, and citizens work together to envi- sion the long-term future of their communities (FHWA 2005b). Scenario planning starts with a business-as-usual baseline scenario, incorporating cur- rent plans or trends for a region. Then, a range of alternative future scenarios is identified on the basis of community input, through the use of tools and transportation models incorporating geographic information to identify im- pacts both quantitatively and visually. Typically, one scenario is chosen as the preferred alternative and is adopted as the region’s vision for the future. According to a recent survey, MPOs are the lead sponsors of scenario plan- ning, followed by nonprofit organizations (e.g., environmental groups) and local governments (Bartholomew 2005). Numerous localities—Salt Lake City, Houston, Sacramento, Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago, among others—have adopted this approach. The recently released 2035 Regional Transportation Plan for Greater Houstonis a good example of the use of scenarios to examine the impacts of different land development choices on travel congestion, transit use, and population growth in floodplains and hurricane evacuation zones (Houston– Galveston Area Council 2007). Facing a projected 75 percent increase in population and a 60 percent increase in employment over the next 30 years, the council of governments for the greater Houston area—the Houston– Galveston Area Council—spearheaded the Envision Houston Region initiative in 2005 to engage elected officials, residents, and other stakeholders in planning and creating a long-term growth strategy to 2035. Four scenarios were considered, ranging from the status quo to a scenario assuming high- density mixed-use development along transit corridors and town centers; the latter is the selected Envision scenario, which planners believe offers a rea- sonable path forward and has considerable community support. The regional plan also is notable for taking the first steps toward integrat- ing climate change into the transportation planning process. The planners noted the vulnerability of the region to tropical storms and flooding, likely to be intensified by climate change and land subsidence, and the scenarios considered compared population growth in sensitive floodplains and hurri- cane evacuation areas. The chosen Envision scenario showed a reduction in population in both areas, alleviating demand on evacuation routes as com- pared with the baseline, status quo scenario.",
        "Meeting the Challenges 163 planning process by identifying plausible impact scenarios. University of Washington climate scientists, for example, developed projections of sea level rise for Seattle that became a consideration in designing a major reha- bilitation of the Alaskan Way Seawall.11 In those major metropolitan areas highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,where projected sea level rise combined with storm surge could threaten already densely developed areas—parts of New York City, Miami,and San Francisco,for example—options such as levees and storm barrier systems are likely to be considered to protect valuable real estate. These options are costly, they can create environmental problems, and they may provide a false sense of security.12 Moreover,as was the experi- ence in New Orleans, levees can encourage development in “protected” flood risk areas (ASFPM 2007).In small communities,exposure to impacts of climate change may necessitate abandoning homes, businesses, and infrastructure and relocating inland. For example, reduced sea ice along Alaska’s Arctic coast is already eroding shoreline and exposing coastal areas to the action of winter storm surges and waves,a pattern that will be exac- erbated by further sea level rise.Some 200 Native American villages are at risk and may soon be abandoned for inland locations (ACIA 2004). CROSSCUTTING ISSUES Flood Insurance Private insurers may be able to accomplish what government cannot in terms of land use control.Some major insurers,for example,are refusing to write new or renew existing homeowners’policies in areas already vul- nerable to hurricanes and other severe storms,which are likely to intensify in a warming climate (Adams 2006).Florida,Texas,Louisiana,Mississippi, Hawaii,New York City,and Long Island are among the affected areas thus 11 Sea level projections from the climate impacts research group at the University of Washington suggested that the city’s current design standards for the new seawall did not adequately account for the potential projected rise in sea level. Given the magnitude of the long-term financial and transportation impacts of the Alaskan Way Seawall project, the City Auditor’s Office recommended that the city obtain a comprehensive, independent analysis that would consider all available scientific sources in estimating the probabilities of expected increases in sea level and their rate (Soo Hoo and Sumitani 2005). 12 Levees interfere with the natural attenuation of flows from floodwaters, cause backwaters, generally increase the depth and velocity of floodwaters, and encourage channel degradation and eventual bank erosion (ASFPM 2007).",
        "164 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation far.Some states,such as Florida,have stepped up to become insurers oflast resort for coastal homes and businesses, but the high costs of providing coverage are unlikely to be sustainable or would result in prohibitive pre- mium increases in many cases if the costs were passed on to homeowners. Moreover, the provision of insurance in hazard-prone areas that is not actuarially sound is bad public policy. The federal government is already the insurer of last resort for home- owners and businesses that cannot secure affordable private flood insurance in flood hazard areas.In 1968 Congress authorized the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to mitigate increasing taxpayer-funded flood relief.The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) admin- isters the program and maps the nation’s floodplains;these maps serve as the basis for determining the eligibility ofhomeowners and businesses for NFIP funding.To become eligible,a community must adopt and enforce floodplain management ordinances and building code requirements to reduce future flood damage.13 In exchange,NFIP makes federally backed, affordable flood insurance available to homeowners, renters, and busi- nesses in mapped Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) through licensed agents and insurance companies. Flood insurance is required to secure financing for buying, building, or improving a structure in SFHAs. New buildings must be elevated to or above the predicted 100-year flood level, and foundations must be designed to resist flood loads (Elliott 2005). Buildings that are repaired or improved after floods must be brought into compliance with these ordinances ifthe repair costs 50 percent or more of the market value of the structure. Over the years,NFIP has been criticized for encouraging more devel- opment in these flood-prone areas than would have occurred without the program (Elliott 2005;Burby 2006).Others suggest that the program has had little impact because many properties (e.g., beach houses) are pur- chased without a mortgage and thus need not comply with floodplain ordinances.Communities have also been slow to enact and enforce flood- plain management measures. Finally, flood insurance is not required of properties located behind levees that have been certified for 100-year storms, even though such properties are at enhanced risk for any flood that exceeds the 100-year storm. Because climate change is projected to 13 Details of the program were accessed from the FEMA website at www.fema.gov/about/programs/ nfip.shtm on May 9, 2007.",
        "Meeting the Challenges 165 trigger more intense storms and sea level rise will extend the areas of flood damage in some SFHAs, FEMA and congressional oversight com- mittees should reevaluate the risk reduction effectiveness ofthe program. FEMA is engaged in a multiyear map modernization program to pro- vide reliable digital flood hazard data and maps in support of NFIP. However, the maps are based on historical data and thus do not take account ofclimate change.The SFHA boundaries are keyed to the 100-year storm,the base elevation data are inadequate (NRC 2007),and the pace of updating is slow.In fact,some states have taken over the task of updating to speed up the process. Further additions to flood zone maps may be needed and are particularly important to transportation engineers because these maps have become a quasi–design standard for determining appro- priate drainage capacity, for example, for transportation infrastructure in coastal areas. Monitoring Technologies and New Materials Better monitoring technologies and new materials could offer engineers alternatives to costly infrastructure retrofit or replacement in advance of climate change. For example, better systems for monitoring impacts of climate change on infrastructure could provide engineers with an early warning ofproblems,buying time for making the necessary modifications. This approach would also provide a good solution for less critical infra- structure facilities for which the costs of retrofitting in anticipation of climate change are not economical. In Alaska, where climate warming is occurring more rapidly than in the lower 48 states, engineers are closely monitoring bridge foundations for scour.Hotter,dryer summers have led to increased glacial melting and longer periods of high stream flows,lead- ing to both increased sediment transport on rivers and scour at bridge crossings.A network of sonars has been installed on several scour-critical bridges around the state. The monitoring data are sent regularly to the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (J. Conaway, United States Geological Survey,personal communication,March 8,2006), an approach that could be adapted for use in other states.14 Sensors and other “smart”technologies yet to be developed could also be used more widely to monitor changing climate conditions and issue 14 The FHWA scour program requires bridge owners to evaluate bridges for potential scour associated with the 100-year storm and a 500-year superflood event (FHWA 2005a).",
        "166 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation warnings when thresholds are exceeded.Sensors are already available that monitor changing pressures on a building or bridge and issue a warning when the pressures become abnormal (Meyer 2006).Sensors could also be embedded in pavements and bridge decks,for example,to monitor stress and strain as temperatures change, enabling remedial action to be taken before failure occurs.The collapse ofthe Minneapolis Interstate 35W bridge in August 2007 brought renewed attention to the need for better technolo- gies to monitor bridge conditions. Numerous technologies are available: X-ray machines can spot hidden cracks in girders,computerized monitors can track minute changes in stresses on steel beams,and sensors embedded in concrete can track corrosion ofsteel reinforcing beams.The costs are not small—one estimate to install monitoring equipment on a large bridge was $250,000—but relative to retrofitting or replacing a failed structure, the costs are marginal (Inside ITS2007).Advances in material sciences (appli- cations of nanotechnologies),15computer processing,and communications capabilities,as well as in sensor technologies,could provide a fertile field for the development ofdevices for monitoring climate changes and communi- cating the results to the appropriate infrastructure owners. New materials also hold promise for addressing some climate changes. For example,temperature extremes,particularly increases in very hot days and heat waves, are likely to affect both pavements and rails. Changnon et al. (1996) report that highways and railroads were damaged by heat- induced heaving and buckling of joints during the 1995 heat wave in Chicago.Extreme heat can also cause misalignment ofrail lines and derail- ments, although the use of continuous welded rail should prevent kinks from occurring (Changnon 2006). Continued research and development of materials that can withstand high temperatures would be productive,as would effective mechanisms for sharing new knowledge. Data, Models, and Decision Support Tools Data systems for monitoring the impacts of climate change can be an effective tool for determining appropriate adaptation strategies.One such system is the Alaska Engineering Design Information System (AEDIS), described in Chapter 3.AEDIS provides geographic-specific data on tem- 15 Nanotechnology is a field of applied science focused on control of matter on a scale smaller than 1 micrometer, normally 1 to 100 nanometers, as well as the fabrication of devices on this same scale.",
        "Meeting the Challenges 167 peratures, precipitation levels, permafrost, and snow depth collected from weather stations located around the state.The data are intended to help in deriving engineering design parameters (e.g.,load-bearing capac- ity), scheduling maintenance and repairs, and selecting optimum locations for transportation infrastructure (T. Douglas, Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, personal communication, March 9,2006).As trend data accumulate,AEDIS could provide a useful repos- itory of information on the longer-term impacts of climate change on infrastructure that could be linked with a database of response strategies and costs—from changes in maintenance practices,to use of new mate- rials,to design changes. Improving information on weather for transportation infrastructure applications is another important area for development, particularly in view of the potential for more climate extremes. The national needs assessment report ofthe Weather Information for Surface Transportation initiative (OFCM 2002)—a joint effort of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and FHWA—identifies as a par- ticular need more accurate information at higher spatial (e.g., surface temperatures) and temporal resolutions (OFCM 2002).The information must also be provided with sufficient lead time (for forecasts) and cur- rency (for observations) to guide operational decisions. Providing the data will require improved weather detection and forecasting; better understanding of thresholds for precipitation, temperature, winds, and the like, which affect transportation operations and, if exceeded, could cause significant interruptions in operations or infrastructure failure; and improvements in data integration and real-time communication to both transportation operators and system users (Lockwood 2006).Clarus, a major initiative of FHWA’s Surface Transportation Weather Program,16 is already working to develop and demonstrate an integrated nationwide surface weather observing, forecasting, and data management system.A range ofobservational technologies,from remote to fixed sensors to vehi- cle probes, are being tested as sources of real-time data, as is a suite of tools to make use of the data. Such efforts could have application for other transportation modes. 16 The Surface Transportation Weather Program was authorized in SAFETEA-LU for $5 million annually for 4 years. The primary focus is on alleviating the impacts of adverse weather on the safety and reliability of the nation’s highways.",
        "168 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation The 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons provided a vivid illustration of the need for improvements in modeling of the effects of storm surge and wave action,which will be aggravated by sea level rise.NOAA’s Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes model and, more recently, the Advanced Circulation Model (ADCIRC) (described in Chapter 2) have been used to estimate the threat from storm surge.17These models use historical input data that are infrequently updated. For example, when ADCIRC was run with input data through the 2005 hurricane sea- son, it was found that the magnitude of the 100-year storm-surge flood would now reoccur at an interval of75 years.After Hurricane Katrina,con- siderable research was also conducted on wave action on bridges (J.Krolak, briefing, Wave Force Symposium, Turner–Fairbank Highway Research Center,July 27,2006);the results of this research should help in revising coastal bridge design standards. If extreme weather events require evacuation of affected areas, better modeling to support evacuation efforts will be needed. Some MPOs are using travel demand models to estimate the time required to evacuate regional areas for different types of emergencies, but this is not common practice. For example, according to modeling estimates provided after Hurricane Rita by the Houston–Galveston Area Council,the council ofgov- ernments for the Houston metropolitan area,it would take 80 to 120 hours to evacuate 3 million residents from Galveston,Houston,and other coastal areas,assuming use of contraflow and optimum flow conditions.The nec- essary lead time far exceeds the ability of meteorologists to predict the landfall and trajectory of hurricanes (Houston–Galveston Area Council 2007), and this has led local governments to consider hardening public facilities on higher ground and encouraging residents in nonvulnerable coastal areas to shelter in place.Simulation models are also being used to help identify optimal evacuation routes, compute estimated evacuation times,and determine traffic management needs for an emergency planning area (Goldblatt and Weinisch 2005). However, these models must be upgraded to provide more real-time information to assist emergency man- 17 ADCIRC is being applied in southern Louisiana by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers New Orleans District to design levee heights and alignments, by FEMA to establish flooding probabilities for insurance purposes, by the State of Louisiana at the Center for the Study of Public Health Impacts of Hurricanes to operationally predict hurricane inundation, and by the Louisiana State Department of Natural Resources to assess coastal restoration projects (information from the ADCIRC website, accessed at www.adcirc.org on October 10, 2007).",
        "Meeting the Challenges 169 agers and transportation providers in responding to an incident (e.g., by changing routing instructions and notifying emergency response teams). New Partnerships and Organizational Arrangements Adapting successfully to climate change will require forging new partner- ships and organizational arrangements that better align with the impacts ofclimate change,which do not follow modal,jurisdictional,or corporate boundaries. As discussed earlier, decision making in the transportation sector is structured around these boundaries.Transportation planning is conducted primarily at the regional level, often in a bottom-up process that starts with local jurisdictions. Railroads, trucking, and waterborne commerce are largely private enterprises with varying levels of federal participation. Partnerships could involve closer collaboration between transportation agencies and emergency responders. Tabletop exercises, for example, in which emergency managers and critical transportation agencies, among others,role play their responses to hypothetical emergency situations (e.g., a terrorist attack,a major hurricane),provide an opportunity for such coor- dination and contact. Other relevant partnerships could involve local collaboration between university climate scientists and regional transporta- tion planners; greater interaction between transportation planners and those who control land use (both described previously); and creation of a more formal process for better communication among transportation pro- fessionals,climate scientists,and other relevant scientific disciplines,along with a repository for transportation-relevant climate change information. The creation ofregional and multistate organizational arrangements to address climate change is a formidable challenge but could yield enormous payoffs in the ability to respond not only to climate change but also to other natural and man-made disasters (e.g., earthquakes, terrorist inci- dents).The transportation sector has some models for cross-jurisdictional arrangements, such as regional authorities for specific facilities (e.g., the Alameda Corridor in California).18 Regional and multistate emergency 18 Created as a Joint Powers Authority by affected cities, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority guided the development of a 20-mile-long rail cargo expressway. The expressway separates freight rail from street traffic and passenger trains while linking the ports to the transcontinental rail network near downtown Los Angeles.",
        "170 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation response operations that include transportation are beginning to emerge in the wake ofhurricanes and other disasters,such as the events ofSeptember 11,2001.These might serve as the nucleus for multistate regional compacts to address other issues,such as the impacts ofclimate change (Deen 2006). State-mandated regional compacts for addressing regional air quality issues offer another model.19 One could imagine the emergence of similar arrangements to address such problems as the impact of sea level rise on coastal real estate and infrastructure in the tristate New York area or other coastal areas,the effects ofdrought on shipping along inland waterways,or the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region. The development of organizational arrangements “right-sized” to address the problems for transportation infrastructure created by cli- mate change may require state or federal action.The California Coastal Commission is a good example of a state initiative designed to resolve a regional problem.In the early 1970s,many Californians became alarmed that private development was cutting offpublic access to the shore and by voter initiative petitioned the state to exert its stewardship role to protect coastal assets for future generations. In 1976 the state legislature enacted the California Coastal Act and established a permanent California Coastal Commission, which plans and regulates development and use of natural resources along the coast in partnership with local governments and in keeping with the requirements of the Coastal Act (California Coastal Commission 2007).One could imagine a similar arrangement to mediate land use and development issues in vulnerable coastal areas in light of projected climate changes. FINDINGS Adaptation is unavoidable to address the impacts ofclimate change due to GHG emissions released into the atmosphere decades ago or longer.The prudent strategy is for transportation professionals to begin now to take a 19 In the eastern half of the United States, for example, where regional ozone is an important concern, organizations such as the Ozone Transport Commission and the ad hoc Ozone Transport Assessment Group were established, the former in 1991 under the auspices of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments. In the west, where degrading visibility in scenic areas is a growing problem, the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission and its successor, the Western Regional Air Partnership, were established as voluntary organizations representing western states, tribes, and the federal government. The main purpose of these groups is to recommend and implement multi- state mitigation strategies for air pollution that extend beyond any one state border (NRC 2004a).",
        "Meeting the Challenges 171 more proactive approach in addressing both past and potential future impacts ofclimate change.A wide array ofadaptation options is available. The most immediate response is likely to come through changes in transportation operating and maintenance practices. These changes will involve incorporating responses to more extreme weather events into routine operations, improving collaboration with emergency managers, recognizing weather and emergency management as integral functions of transportation agency operations, and widely sharing best practices. To make decisions about rehabilitating or retrofitting transportation infra- structure with long service lives,transportation planners and engineers will need to consider how climate change will affect these facilities 50 years or more into the future.Design changes may also be required to harden long- lived infrastructure in locations particularly vulnerable to climate changes. The development of new standards to address climate change will be a time-consuming process,requiring research and testing and the consensus of practicing engineers.In view of the myriad of potential climate change impacts to be considered, the scientific community and relevant profes- sional organizations should take the lead in initiating a program soon,with federal support for the necessary research and testing.Relocation of some transportation systems,such as coastal roads and rail lines,may ultimately prove necessary.Costly levees or storm barrier systems may be considered to protect valuable real estate in selected densely populated exposed areas. One of the most effective strategies for reducing the risks of climate change is to avoid placing people and infrastructure in vulnerable loca- tions. This is not always possible in highly developed areas, but more stringent land use controls and flood insurance requirements could help curb further development. Federal planning regulations should require that transportation planners take climate change into account in develop- ing long-range plans, as well as collaborate with agencies responsible for land use,so that the consequences of infrastructure investment decisions for land use and vice versa can be more clearly identified. FEMA should reevaluate the risk reduction effectiveness ofNFIP.At a minimum,updat- ing of flood zone maps to account for sea level rise (incorporating land subsidence) should be a priority in coastal areas. Better monitoring technologies and new materials could also provide alternatives to costly upgrading of some infrastructure.More widespread use of sensors for monitoring impacts of climate change and new heat- resistant paving materials are examples. More refined data (e.g., better",
        "172 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation elevation data for floodplain mapping, more accurate data on surface temperatures) and improved modeling—from weather forecasting to modeling of expected storm surge and real-time evacuation scenarios— are needed as well. Adapting to climate change will also require new partnerships and organizational arrangements that better align with climate impacts than do current modal,jurisdictional,and corporate boundaries around which decision making in the transportation sector is structured.Some models for regional and multistate cooperation exist in regional emergency response initiatives and in regional authorities and compacts for air quality, but state or federal incentives may be necessary to ensure the development of organizations “right-sized”to address the problems for transportation infrastructure raised by climate change. At the federal level,an interagency working group could be created, focused solely on adaptation issues for the transportation sector,to help shape existing agency research programs. The U.S. Department of Transportation would be the natural lead for this activity. Embracing these adaptation strategies would require overcoming many of the barriers outlined in Chapter 4. First and foremost, trans- portation leaders would need to agree that climate change is a problem that warrants action. Thinking longer term, adopting more risk-based approaches to investment decisions, and forging new partnerships and organizational arrangements are among the greatest challenges.The next and final chapter provides the committee’s recommendations for moving forward.

        "6 Summing Up T he charge to this committee was to review the current scientific understanding of climate change from the perspective of those changes of particular relevance for U.S. transportation, including the limits of current knowledge; to identify potential impacts on U.S.trans- portation infrastructure and operations; to consider adaptation options; and to offer recommendations on actions that can be taken to prepare for climate change and on needed research.In this final chapter,the commit- tee presents its consensus findings and recommendations in response to this charge,along with its principal supporting arguments.The commit- tee’s consensus position was informed by the five papers commissioned for this study; the 1-day conference held midway through the study to obtain the input of a broad range of transportation academicians and practitioners, climate scientists, and other experts; reviews of previous studies that examined the potential impacts of climate change on trans- portation,with a focus on adaptation strategies;numerous briefings on a wide range of relevant topics presented at committee meetings; and the committee’s own expertise and judgment. The chapter is organized on the basis of a series of questions that guided the committee’s thinking. WHICH CLIMATE CHANGES ARE MOST RELEVANT FOR U.S. TRANSPORTATION? Finding: The past several decades of historical regional climate patterns commonly used by transportation planners to guide their operations and investments may no longer be a reliable guide for future plans.In particular,future climate will include new classes (in terms of magnitude and frequency) of weather and climate 189",
        "190 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation extremes,such as record rainfall and record heat waves,not expe- rienced in modern times as human-induced changes are superimposed on the climate’s natural variability. Transportation planners and engineers typically extrapolate from histori- cal weather and climate patterns in planning and designing infrastructure. The past will not be a good predictor of future conditions, however, as climate changes bring new weather patterns and climate extremes that exceed current experience.Projections offuture climate are often depicted as gradual changes,such as the rise in global temperatures or in sea levels projected over this century. However, climate changes are unlikely to be experienced in such a smooth manner because human-induced changes will be amplified in some years by naturally fluctuating conditions, reflected in potentially sudden and dramatic changes at the regional or local level, where transportation infrastructure is located.Warming tem- peratures may trigger weather extremes and surprises,such as more rapid melting of the Arctic sea ice or more rapid rise in sea levels than is pro- jected by current climate models. On the basis of current knowledge, climate scientists have identified five climate changes of particular importance to U.S.transportation and estimated the probability of their occurrence during the 21st century: • Increases in very hot days and heat waves (very likely),1 • Increases in Arctic temperatures (virtually certain), • Rising sea levels (virtually certain), • Increases in intense precipitation events (very likely),and • Increases in hurricane intensity (likely). HOW WILL CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECT U.S. TRANSPORTATION? Finding: Climate change will affect transportation primarily through increases in several types ofweather and climate extremes, such as very hot days; intense precipitation events; intense hurri- 1The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) Working Group I established the following terminology to describe uncertainty, that is, the probability of occurrence: virtually certain, >99 percent; extremely likely, >95 percent; very likely, >90 percent; likely, >66 percent; more likely than not, >50 percent; unlikely, <33 percent; very unlikely, <10 percent; extremely unlikely, <5 percent.",
        "Summing Up 191 canes; drought; and rising sea levels, coupled with storm surges and land subsidence.The impacts will vary by mode oftransporta- tion and region of the country, but they will be widespread and costly in both human and economic terms and will require signif- icant changes in the planning,design,construction,operation,and maintenance of transportation systems. Transportation infrastructure was designed for typical weather patterns and environmental conditions,reflecting local climate and incorporating assumptions about a reasonable range of temperatures and precipitation levels. It will be affected most by those climate changes that cause envi- ronmental conditions to extend outside the range for which the system was designed. Finding: Potentially, the greatest impact of climate change for North America’s transportation systems will be flooding ofcoastal roads, railways, transit systems, and runways because of global rising sea levels, coupled with storm surges and exacerbated in some locations by land subsidence. Fully 53 percent of the U.S.population now lives in counties with coastal regions,many among the most densely populated in the nation.If devel- opment pressures continue in vulnerable coastal areas,and there is every reason to believe they will,the impacts of climate change will be magni- fied as increasing numbers of people and businesses are placed in harm’s way, and the infrastructure is expanded or new infrastructure is built to accommodate the growth. The Atlantic and Gulf Coasts are particularly vulnerable because they have already experienced high levels of erosion, land subsidence, and loss of wetlands. Their vulnerability to the storm surges and wave action that accompany strong tropical storms was amply demonstrated during the 2005 hurricane season.Sea level rise and coastal flooding also pose risks for the East Coast,as well as the Pacific Northwest and parts of the California coast. The impacts of climate change will not be limited to coastal areas. For example,watersheds supplying water to the St.Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes,as well as the Upper Midwest river system,are likely to experience drier conditions,resulting in lower water levels and reduced capacity to ship agricultural and other bulk commodities, although a longer shipping season could offset some of the adverse economic",
        "192 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation effects.Thawing permafrost in Alaska is already creating settlement and land subsidence problems for roads, rail lines, runways, and pipelines. Higher temperature extremes (mainly heat waves) in some U.S.regions could lead to more frequent buckling ofpavements and misalignment of rail lines. More severe weather events with intense precipitation could increase the severity of extensive flooding events,such as the storms that plagued the Midwest during the 1993 flooding of the Mississippi and Missouri River system, the Chicago area in 1996, and the Houston region during Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. Flooding of a waterway system can knock out barge operations on the river itself,rail operations on rights-of-way adjacent to the river, and even highway approaches to bridges crossing flooded rivers. Not all climate change impacts will be negative. For example, the marine transportation sector could benefit from more open seas in the Arctic,creating new and shorter shipping routes and reducing transport time and costs. In cold regions, expected temperature rises, particularly decreases in very cold days and later onset of seasonal freezes and earlier onset of seasonal thaws,could mean reduced costs of snow and ice con- trol for departments of transportation and safer travel conditions for passenger vehicles and freight. Recommendation 1:Federal,state,and local governments,in collaboration with owners and operators of infrastructure, such as ports and airports,and private railroad and pipeline companies, should inventory critical transportation infra- structure in light ofclimate change projections to determine whether,when,and where projected climate changes in their regions might be consequential. Inventorying transportation assets essential to maintaining network per- formance to determine their potential vulnerability to projected climate changes is a sensible first step. Information about projected climate changes is currently available from climate scientists for large subconti- nental regions—a scale more relevant than global projections for regional and local transportation infrastructure.Although such an inventory must be updated periodically as new scientific knowledge about climate change becomes available, inventorying is a relatively low-cost activity. Many of the tools needed for the purpose [e.g., geographic information systems (GIS)] are available. The inventorying process itself should help identify",
        "Summing Up 193 with greater precision the data needed on transportation-relevant climate changes and encourage collaboration between transportation profession- als and climate scientists. HOW SHOULD TRANSPORTATION DECISION MAKERS RESPOND? Finding:Public authorities and officials at various governmental levels and executives ofprivate companies are continually making short- and long-term investment decisions that have implications for how the transportation system will respond to climate change in the near and long terms. Transportation decision makers have an opportunity now to prepare for projected climate changes.Decisions made today,particularly those related to the redesign and retrofitting of existing or the location and design of new transportation infrastructure,will affect how well the system adapts to climate change far into the future. Many transportation facilities, such as bridges, large culverts, and rail and port facilities, are designed with long service lives and help shape development patterns that, once in place, are difficult to change. Thus, transportation planners and engineers should consider how projected climate changes in their regions might affect these facilities. Recommendation 2:State and local governments and private infrastructure providers should incorporate climate change into their long-term capital improvement plans, facility designs, maintenance practices, operations, and emergency response plans. Taking measures now to evaluate and protect the most vulnerable infra- structure should pay off by diminishing near-term maintenance expenditures and reducing the risk of catastrophic failure,with its toll on human life and disruption of economic activity. Such measures might include strengthening or elevating some coastal roads, rail lines, and bridges, particularly those that serve as evacuation routes, or upgrading parallel routes where they are available.2 In the longer term,relocation of 2States in particularly vulnerable regions such as the Gulf Coast could consider securing and banking rights-of-way for alternative evacuation routes, should they prove necessary.",
        "194 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation rights-of-way farther inland or installation ofcostly storm barrier systems to protect selected areas (e.g.,parts of New York City or Miami) might be considered. Finding:The significant costs ofredesigning and retrofitting trans- portation infrastructure to adapt to potential impacts of climate change suggest the need for more strategic, risk-based approaches to investment decisions. Designing transportation facilities to more robust standards to hedge against potentially negative impacts ofclimate change will produce much more costly designs that are likely to be unacceptable given limited budg- ets. More strategic and selective risk-based approaches are needed for determining appropriate design standards and investment priorities. Transportation professionals already take risk into account, particularly in designing facilities.For example,structures are designed to withstand certain wind speeds on the basis of probabilistic assessments of wind speed occurrence using historical data on wind speed frequency.Drainage requirements for many transportation facilities are sized to accommo- date the 100-year storm, a probabilistic assessment of storm frequency. Engineers also commonly incorporate safety factors into designs or design standards to account for unforeseen events or abnormal forces on structures.In general,however,transportation decision makers have a long way to go to take full advantage ofquantitative,risk-based approaches that incorporate uncertainty and probabilistic assessments in making invest- ment and design decisions. Recommendation 3: Transportation planners and engineers should use more probabilistic investment analyses and design approaches that incorporate techniques for trading off the costs of making the infrastructure more robust against the economic costs offailure.At a more general level, these techniques could also be used to communicate these trade-offs to policy makers who make investment decisions and authorize funding. At present,the necessary data and certitude about projections offuture cli- mate,particularly at the local and regional levels,are not available to permit a comprehensive probabilistic risk assessment and analysis.However,more",
        "Summing Up 195 simplified approaches can be used by transportation planners and engi- neers to incorporate many of these risk assessment concepts into their planning and design. One model is the California Seismic Retrofit Program. Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, the California Department of Transportation developed a risk-based approach for ana- lyzing the vulnerability of highway bridges statewide to earthquakes and their criticality to the network to make it possible to determine investment priorities for retrofitting and replacement. The program established a higher performance standard for 750 structures to protect the investment in these major facilities and ensure that these vital transportation lifelines would remain in service after a major seismic event to provide access for emergency responders.The state’s 11 major toll bridges were handled sep- arately because their complexity demanded a time-consuming dynamic analysis. For most other bridges, the standard was “no collapse” under a maximum seismic event, consistent with the geographic location of the bridge.The objective was to avoid loss of life;however,some damage to a structure was acceptable as long as it remained intact and could be reopened for service soon after the event. Extending and incorporating such techniques to include climate change will require more complete data on the likelihood of climate- related hazards and their economic consequences. It will also necessitate continuing education of current planners and engineers and training of future professionals.Finally,educating policy makers to gain their support will entail communicating the information so that the trade-offs and investment priorities are clear.It may also require new eligibility criteria in funding programs, and new funding sources may also be necessary to make the investments identified by the application of these techniques. WHAT DATA AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS ARE NEEDED? Finding:Transportation professionals often lack sufficiently detailed information about expected climate changes and their timing to take appropriate action. Transportation decision makers note that one of the most difficult aspects of addressing climate change is obtaining the relevant information in the form they need for planning and design.This difficulty is not limited to the transportation sector. A recent National Research Council report (NRC",
        "196 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 2007) found that while the scientific understanding of climate change has made great progress,the use ofthat knowledge to support decision making and formulate mitigation and adaptation strategies is much less well devel- oped.Climate change is understood with greatest confidence as a global or continental phenomenon, while transportation planners as well as other decision makers need local and regional climate projections. They also need a better understanding of how projected climate changes, such as changes in temperature and precipitation,will affect the environment (e.g., soil moisture, runoff) in which the infrastructure is situated, which will vary from region to region. Climate projections themselves are presented by climate scientists as a portfolio of plausible scenarios and outcomes, which are continually refined and revised as new knowledge accumulates. Transportation planners need to have a better understanding ofwhich sce- narios are most plausible for their regions and most significant for their operations and plans. Recommendation 4:The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), the U.S. Geological Survey, and other relevant agencies should work together to institute a process for bet- ter communication among transportation professionals, climate scientists, and other relevant scientific disciplines, and establish a clearinghouse for transportation-relevant cli- mate change information. All professions should benefit from the collaboration.Transportation pro- fessionals would be encouraged to define with greater precision the climate data needed to improve transportation decisions,such as temperature and precipitation thresholds at finer-grained geographic scales or climate con- ditions that would create unacceptable performance outcomes. Climate scientists would be challenged to elaborate on the possibilities and limita- tions of projecting impacts of climate change at the levels of geographic specificity that are most useful for transportation planners.And hydrolo- gists and others would be challenged to consider how the environment would influence these effects and their impacts on transportation infra- structure.One promising approach might be for the federal government to support a number of pilot projects in which federal agencies would work closely with local transportation planners to include the full range of rele- vant climate information that could affect a specific project.",
        "Summing Up 197 Finding: Better decision support tools are also needed to assist transportation decision makers. Recommendation 5: Ongoing and planned research at fed- eral and state agencies and universities that provide climate data and decision support tools should include the needs of transportation decision makers. For example, the research program of the USDOT Center for Climate Change and Environmental Forecasting could be charged with expanding its existing research program in this area and provided the necessary fund- ing.Needed tools include accurate digital elevation maps in coastal areas for forecasting the effects offlooding and storm surge heights;GIS that can be used to map the locations of critical infrastructure,overlaid with informa- tion on climate change effects (e.g.,sea level rise,permafrost melt);greater use of scenarios that include climate change in the development of long- range regional transportation plans to pinpoint likely vulnerabilities (e.g., areas susceptible to sea level rise,aggravated by storm surge) and ways to address them;and better transportation network models for examining the systemwide effects ofthe loss ofcritical transportation infrastructure links. WHICH ADAPTATION STRATEGIES MAKE SENSE? Transportation decision makers have a wide range of adaptation options from which to choose in determining how best to adjust to climate change.One way to organize these options is around the timescales used by transportation professionals in their decision making. For example, operational decisions are typically focused on the short term and thus will be concerned mainly with near-term changes in weather and climate con- ditions. Decisions about rehabilitating or retrofitting infrastructure are made with a longer time horizon in mind.Such decisions will determine the performance of those assets with long service lives for many decades and thus should take longer-term climate projections into consideration so likely hazards can be assessed. Decisions about new infrastructure or major capacity additions involve the longest time frame because they will shape land use and development patterns for years to come and thus may require consideration of climate change projections that extend into the 22nd century. Other adaptation options, such as monitoring and use of technology or new organizational arrangements,cut across timescales and",
        "198 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation offer adaptation options in their own right or ways to better incorporate climate change in transportation decision making. Operational Responses Finding: Projected increases in extreme weather and climate underscore the importance of emergency response plans in vul- nerable locations and require that transportation providers work more closely with weather forecasters and emergency planners and assume a greater role in evacuation planning and emergency response. U.S. transportation providers already address the impacts of weather on transportation system operations in a diverse range ofclimatic conditions. For example,snow and ice control accounts for about 40 percent ofannual highway operating budgets in the northern U.S.states.Likewise,hurricane planning has become a major focus of transportation operations in the Gulf Coast states, where transportation providers are forging close rela- tionships with emergency responders to handle severe weather events. As climate changes induce new extremes (e.g., more intense storms, more intense precipitation), operational responses are likely to become more routine and proactive than today’s approach of treating severe weather on an ad hoc, emergency basis. For example, if hurricanes increase in intensity,as is likely to be the case,establishment ofevacuation routes and use of contraflow operations may become as commonplace as the current use of snow emergency routes in the Northeast and Midwest. More accurate and timely weather prediction and communication of storm warnings in real time to those potentially in harm’s way will become more important. Recommendation 6: Transportation agencies and service providers should build on the experience in those locations where transportation is well integrated into emergency response and evacuation plans. Following the events of September 11, 2001, and the experience with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, coordination between state and local emergency managers—the first responders in an emergency—and transportation agencies and service providers improved, particularly in",
        "Summing Up 199 those locations with recurring natural disasters, such as hurricanes. In some locations, transportation is represented at emergency operations centers—command posts that can be activated rapidly in an emergency. Transportation agencies and service providers are also working closely with weather forecasters and emergency response planners to convey their own lead-time requirements so they can provide the personnel and equipment necessary for evacuation and protect their own assets. Transportation agencies and service providers in locations where collab- oration is not as advanced should build on this experience. Monitoring and Use of Technology Finding: Greater use of technology would enable infrastructure providers to monitor climate changes and receive advance warn- ing of potential failures due to water levels and currents, wave action, winds, and temperatures exceeding what the infrastruc- ture was designed to withstand. Monitoring infrastructure conditions,particularly the impacts of weather and climate extremes, offers an alternative to preventive retrofitting or reconstruction ofsome facilities.It is also an activity that can begin imme- diately.In Alaska,which is experiencing more accelerated climate changes than the lower 48 states,the Alyeska Pipeline Company already monitors the right-of-way of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to spot land subsi- dence problems, particularly along the 800 miles of pipeline elevated on vertical supports.Alaskan engineers also closely monitor bridge supports, which are experiencing damage from earlier winter runoff and increased stream flow.In the future,sensors and other “smart”technologies could be embedded in the infrastructure to monitor changing climate conditions and impacts and provide warning when pressure or stress thresholds are being exceeded.Development of more heat-resistant materials could help protect pavements and some rail facilities,in particular,from the adverse impacts of projected temperature extremes. Recommendation 7:Federal and academic research programs should encourage the development and implementation of monitoring technologies that could provide advance warning of pending failures due to the effects of weather and climate extremes on major transportation facilities.",
        "200 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Advances in sensor technologies,computer processing,and communica- tions capabilities should provide a fertile field for the development of smart devices that can be used for monitoring changing climate condi- tions and communicating the results to the appropriate transportation infrastructure owners. Advances in material sciences should enable the development of new materials that can withstand climate extremes. Sharing of Best Practices Finding:The geographic extent ofthe United States—from Alaska to Florida and from Maine to Hawaii—and its diversity ofweather and climate conditions can provide a laboratory for identifying best practices and sharing information as the climate changes. As a result of climate change,many areas of the United States will expe- rience new climate-induced weather patterns. These changes, however, may not necessarily require the development ofnew operating and main- tenance strategies.The United States has a diverse climate,ranging from subtropical to arctic and from arid to wet,with several regions being sub- ject to temperature extremes and such events as blizzards, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, avalanches, and mudslides. As climate pat- terns change,transfer of best practices from one location to another will be essential. Recommendation 8: The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO),the Federal Highway Administration, the Association of American Railroads, the American Public Transportation Association, the American Association of Port Authorities, the Airport Operators Council,associations for oil and gas pipelines,and other relevant transportation professional and research organizations should develop a mechanism to encourage shar- ing of best practices for addressing the potential impacts of climate change. This effort should build on technology transfer mechanisms that already exist,such as AASHTO’s technology-sharing program.Technology should be defined broadly to include probabilistic decision-making tools,as well as monitoring technologies, new materials, and operating and mainte- nance strategies.",
        "Summing Up 201 Design Changes Finding: Reevaluating, developing, and regularly updating design standards for transportation infrastructure to address the impacts ofclimate change will require a broad-based research and testing program and a substantial implementation effort. Operational responses are geared to addressing near-term impacts of climate change,but rehabilitating or retrofitting transportation facilities— many of which are designed to have long service lives—requires that transportation planners and engineers consider how climate changes will affect the performance of these facilities 50 or more years into the future.Opportunities for adaptation are limited once a facility has been renovated unless engineers build in the potential to make subsequent changes.Addressing climate change will also require reevaluation,develop- ment,and regular updating of design standards that guide infrastructure design. Environmental factors are integral to the design of transportation infrastructure.Conditions such as temperature,freeze–thaw cycles,and duration and intensity ofprecipitation determine subsurface and founda- tion designs, the choice of materials, and drainage capacity. Engineers, however, have given little thought to whether current design standards are adequate to accommodate climate change.For example,will drainage capacity be adequate for expected increases in intense precipitation events? Many infrastructure components are currently designed for the 100-year storm, but projections indicate that today’s 100-year precipita- tion event is likely to occur every 50 or perhaps even every 20 years by the end of this century.What new materials and operating practices might be needed when very hot temperatures and heat waves become more fre- quent? Are infrastructure components sufficiently strong to withstand the forces of larger and more frequent storm surges and more powerful wave action, the effects of which were vividly demonstrated when Hurricane Katrina simply lifted bridge decks off their supporting structures? Developing standards is a time-consuming consensus process that typically involves professional organizations in an extensive research and testing program.Changes in design practices tend to be incremental,and building to higher standards to strengthen transportation infrastructure so it can accommodate the adverse impacts of climate change must be weighed against the costs involved.",
        "202 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Recommendation 9: USDOT should take a leadership role, along with those professional organizations in the forefront of civil engineering practice across all modes, to initiate immediately a federally funded, multiagency research pro- gram for ongoing reevaluation of existing and development of new design standards as progress is made in understand- ing future climate conditions and the options available for addressing them. A research plan and cost proposal should be developed for submission to Congress for authorization and funding ofthis program. Developing standards to address climate change in a timely manner requires leadership by the scientific community and professional associ- ations and, given the scope of the potential impacts, a broadly based, federally sponsored research program.The initial focus ofsuch a program should be on essential links in transportation networks,particularly those vulnerable to climate changes in coastal areas or in low-lying areas in riverside locations. A good model is the congressionally mandated National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program, begun in 1977, which established a research effort and a coordination mechanism to reduce the risks to life and property from earthquakes through the development of standards that afford different levels of protection for different levels of risk.If a similar program is to be launched to address climate change in a timely manner,it should be initiated soon. Recommendation 10: In the short term, state and federally funded transportation infrastructure rehabilitation projects in highly vulnerable locations should be rebuilt to higher standards,and greater attention should be paid to the provi- sion of redundant power and communications systems to ensure rapid restoration of transportation services in the event offailure. Following Hurricane Katrina, for example, the Federal Highway Administration recognized that current design standards for coastal high- way bridges—which were based on a riverine environment and a 50-year storm—were inadequate.The agency approved and shared in the cost of rebuilding bridges damaged in the hurricane to a higher design standard, and it recommended the development of bridge design standards more",
        "Summing Up 203 appropriate for a coastal environment,which take into account the com- bined effects of storm surge and wave action and assume a more severe storm event (e.g.,a 100-year or even a 500-year storm).AASHTO is lead- ing the effort to develop a new consensus standard.Hurricane Katrina also showed the importance of power and communications systems to the restoration of transportation services (e.g.,operation of traffic lights,rail signal systems, pumping stations, air traffic control facilities, and night- time running lights). Finding: Federal agencies have not focused generally on adapta- tion in addressing climate change. The development of appropriate design standards to accommodate cli- mate change is only one ofseveral possible adaptation strategies that may require federal leadership,research,and funding. Recommendation 11: USDOT should take the lead in devel- oping an interagency working group focused on adaptation. This initiative would not necessarily require new funding beyond that recommended above.Better collaboration among federal agencies could help focus attention on adaptation issues and shape existing research programs. Transportation Planning and Land Use Controls Finding: Transportation planners are not currently required to consider climate change impacts and their effects on infrastruc- ture investments,particularly in vulnerable locations. One of the most effective strategies for reducing the risks of climate change is to avoid placing people and infrastructure in vulnerable loca- tions. Transportation planners currently consider expected land use patterns when forecasting future travel demand and infrastructure needs. However, they rarely question whether such development is desirable, much less what effects climate change might have on the provision and development of infrastructure in vulnerable locations.In part,this situa- tion stems from governance arrangements. States, regional authorities, and the private sector are responsible for large-scale transportation",
        "204 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation investment decisions,but local governments and a few states control land use decisions through comprehensive plans, zoning ordinances, permit- ting,and building codes.In some locations,transportation and land use planning are becoming more integrated as a result of smart growth poli- cies,which recognize the impact oftransportation investments on regional development and economic growth and vice versa;however,such integra- tion is uncommon. Recommendation 12: Federal planning regulations should require that climate change be included as a factor in the development of public-sector, long-range transportation plans; eliminate any perception that such plans should be limited to 20 to 30 years; and require collaboration in plan development with agencies responsible for land use, envi- ronmental protection,and natural resource management to foster more integrated transportation–land use decision making. Current surface transportation legislation encourages such collaboration. During reauthorization,requiring transportation planners to both consider climate change and collaborate with land use planners in the preparation of public-sector, long-range plans could go a long way toward making these issues more visible.Some metropolitan planning organizations are already using scenario-based approaches to illustrate the trade-offs among social, economic,and environmental goals and understand the impacts of differ- ent long-range investment plans. Scenario planning could be adapted to take potential climate changes into account, and the results could provide the basis for discussion with local governments and developers responsible for land use decisions,particularly in vulnerable areas. Finding: Locally controlled land use planning, which is typical throughout the country, has too limited a perspective to account for the broadly shared risks of climate change. Any strategy that involves land use controls to address climate change would need to build consensus among key decision makers in transporta- tion and land use,probably at the regional level—a challenging proposition. Federal and state incentives may be needed to encourage new organiza- tional arrangements,a topic discussed later in this chapter.",
        "Summing Up 205 Insurance Finding: The National Flood Insurance Program and the flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) that determine program eligibility do not take climate change into account. The federal government is the insurer of last resort for homeowners and businesses that cannot secure affordable private flood insurance in specially designated flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program, authorized by Congress in 1968 to mitigate increasing taxpayer-funded flood relief, is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).FEMA maps the nation’s floodplains,and eligible home- owners and businesses receive below-cost insurance. In return, the local community must adopt and enforce floodplain management measures, including building code ordinances for new construction and rebuilding after a disaster, to reduce flood damage. In practice, critics contend that the program has resulted in more development than would otherwise have occurred in these areas. Moreover, the accuracy of the FIRMs used to determine program eligibility is woefully inadequate, despite a map- ping modernization program.Flood hazard area boundaries are keyed to the 100-year storm,and base elevation data are inadequate.The maps are based on historical data and thus do not factor in such climate changes as sea level rise and storm surge. Recommendation 13:FEMA should reevaluate the risk reduc- tion effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program and the FIRMs,particularly in view of projected increases in intense precipitation and storms. At a minimum, updated flood zone maps that account for sea level rise (incorporating land subsidence) should be a priority in coastal areas. Climate change may trigger more intense storms, and sea level rise will extend the scope of flood damage in some special flood hazard areas. FEMA and congressional oversight committees should reevaluate the risk reduction effectiveness ofthe National Flood Insurance Program in light of these projected changes. The FIRMs should account for climate change and the likelihood that it will extend the boundaries ofsome special flood hazard areas, which are keyed to the 100-year storm. These changes are particularly important to transportation engineers because the FIRMs have",
        "206 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation become a quasi–design standard,for example,for determining appropriate drainage capacity for transportation infrastructure in coastal areas. New Organizational Arrangements Finding: Current institutional arrangements for transportation planning and operations were not organized to address climate change and may not be adequate for the purpose. The impacts of climate change do not follow modal,corporate,or juris- dictional boundaries,yet decision making in the transportation sector is structured around these boundaries. Transportation planning is con- ducted primarily at the regional level,often through a bottom-up process that starts with local jurisdictions. Railroads, trucking, and waterborne commerce are largely private enterprises with varying levels of federal participation. Thus, existing institutional arrangements are not well suited to addressing climate change.Some models ofcross-jurisdictional cooperation exist,such as regional authorities for specific facilities (e.g., the Alameda Corridor); regional and multistate emergency response agreements; and state-mandated regional authorities, such as those responsible for air quality improvement. One could imagine the emer- gence of similar arrangements to address,for example,the impact of sea level rise on coastal real estate and infrastructure in the tristate New York area or other coastal areas, or the effects of drought on shipping along inland waterways, or the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region. However, state or federal incentives may be required to ensure the development ofsuch organizational arrangements at the regional or multistate level. Recommendation 14:Incentives incorporated in federal and state legislation should be considered as a means of address- ing and mitigating the impacts of climate change through regional and multistate efforts. For example,states could use updated FIRMs or their own state maps to identify geographic areas vulnerable to climate change and craft policies for restricting transportation investments and limiting insurance in these locations.",
        "Summing Up 207 WHAT ACTIONS AND RESEARCH ARE NEEDED TO PREPARE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE? At the outset of this study, the committee was asked to provide recom- mendations on actions to be taken to prepare for climate change and on needed research.The committee interpreted this charge broadly,particu- larly as it applies to research.Many of its recommendations relate to the development and sharing of information, decision support tools, and new technologies and materials,as well as research more narrowly defined. The committee also attempted to identify who should implement each of its recommendations. Actions to prepare for climate change can be taken almost immediately. The committee recommends that transportation agencies and service providers inventory critical infrastructure in light of climate change pro- jections (Recommendation 1); incorporate climate change into their long-term capital improvement plans, facility designs, maintenance prac- tices, operations, and emergency response plans (Recommendation 2); incorporate more probabilistic investment analyses and design approaches and communicate the results ofthese analyses to policy makers in ways that highlight trade-offs and investment priorities (Recommendation 3); and build on the experience oflocations where transportation is well integrated into emergency response and evacuation plans to prepare for projected weather and climate extremes (Recommendation 6). Other steps depend on federal and state action.Federal planning reg- ulations should require inclusion of climate change in the development of long-range plans and collaboration between transportation and land use agencies (Recommendation 12); state and federally funded trans- portation infrastructure rehabilitation projects in highly vulnerable locations should be rebuilt to higher standards until design standards can be assessed more broadly in light of climate change (Recommendation 10); FEMA should reevaluate the risk reduction effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program and update the FIRMs,both in light of climate change (Recommendation 13); and federal and state legisla- tion should incorporate incentives to encourage the development of regional and multistate efforts to address the impacts of climate change (Recommendation 14). Research needs, broadly defined, include establishing a process for better communication among transportation professionals, climate sci- entists, and other relevant scientific disciplines and a clearinghouse for",

Most of these ini- tiatives would require federal action; others would require action by professional organizations and university researchers.In all cases,leader- ship and continuing commitment would be essential.

It will summarize possible consequences for transportation, such as from sea- level rise,higher mean temperatures with less extreme low temperatures and more hot extremes, and, possibly, more frequent and severe rain events. U.S. transportation options for adapting to impacts will be ana- lyzed, including possible need to alter assumptions about infrastructure design and operations; ability to incorporate uncertainty in long-range decision making;and capability ofinstitutions to plan and act on mitiga- tion and adaptation strategies at the state and regional levels. The study will also provide federal, state, and local transportation officials in the United States with an overview of the scientific consensus regarding climate change—including uncertainty about its nature and extent. Drawing heavily upon analyses already prepared,the study will sum- marize current and projected contributions of transportation to climate change and the potential effects,costs,and benefits ofstrategies to reduce transportation’s impact.This would include strategies,for example,that affect land use patterns,influence mode choice,and involve alternatively fueled or more efficient motor vehicles. The study will identify critical areas ofneeded research.The final report will include findings and recommendations regarding needed research and suggested actions to prepare for the possibility of climate change. 209",
        "APPENDIX B Contribution of U.S. Transportation Sector to Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Assessment of Mitigation Strategies T he body of this report describes how climate change is expected to impact the U.S.transportation sector and identifies ways in which this impact might be ameliorated. The committee’s charge also directed it to review what is known about the contribution of transportation to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: Drawing heavily upon analyses already prepared, the study will summarize current and projected contributions oftransportation to climate change and the potential effects,costs,and benefits ofstrate- gies to reduce transportation’s impact.This would include strategies, for example,that affect land use patterns,influence mode choice,and involve alternatively fueled or more efficient motor vehicles. This appendix addresses this aspect of the committee’s charge. HOW THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR INFLUENCES CLIMATE CHANGE Transportation vehicles emit GHGs when fuel undergoes combustion in their engines. The vast majority of these combustion-related emissions consist of carbon dioxide (CO ).1 But road transport vehicles also emit 2 1The U.S. Energy Information Agency’s annual publication Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United Statesprovides estimates of transport sector emissions of CO, CH, and NO. In 2003, 2 4 2 CO accounted for 97 percent of the total, when each gas is converted into its global warming 2 210",
        "Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 211 small amounts ofnitrous oxide (N O) and methane (CH ).Aircraft oper- 2 4 ating at high altitudes emit not only nitrogen oxides (NO ) [which x increases the rate of ozone production by speeding the oxidation of car- bon monoxide (CO) and CH ] but also water vapor [which generates 4 contrails that, depending on the time of day they are produced, either reflect solar radiation back into space (daytime) or trap it (nighttime)] (IPCC 1999;see also Stuber et al.2006). Transport activity is also associated with two additional categories of emissions:(a) those produced in the extraction,production,and distribu- tion of transport fuels and (b) those produced in the manufacture, distribution,and disposal of transport vehicles.2A rough idea of the rela- tive significance ofthese additional categories ofemissions can be obtained from life-cycle studies that attempt to track all emissions related to a vehi- cle and its fuel.One of the best known of these studies estimates that the life-cycle CO emissions generated by a 1996-vintage midsize U.S.passen- 2 ger car using gasoline as its fuel total 263 g/km, of which the vehicle manufacturing cycle (including disposal) accounts for 18 g/km (6.8 per- cent);the fuel cycle,49 g/km (18.7 percent);and fuel combustion,196 g/km (74.5 percent) (Weiss et al.2000,5–8).3 In this appendix, the committee attempts to provide as comprehen- sive a picture as possible of transport-related GHG emissions.It was not feasible to include emissions from each life-cycle stage or emissions of each GHG gas;we do,however,take care to identify which emissions are included in the data presented. CURRENT AND PROJECTED TRANSPORT-RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS According to the 2005 edition of the International Energy Agency (IEA) publication CO Emissions from Fuel Combustion, worldwide CO emis- 2 2 potential. Nearly all the remainder was accounted for by NO (U.S. Energy Information 2 Administration 2004, 31, 49, 62). This publication provides no information on aerosols produced by transport activity, but these are believed to be relatively insignificant. 2The second of these categories is of concern only with respect to road vehicles. The number of nonroad vehicles (locomotives, ships, and aircraft) is so small that the GHG emissions related to their manufacture, distribution, and disposal are minimal. 3The report assumes 95 percent recycling of metals and 50 percent recycling of plastics. In the report, the emissions figures are stated in grams of carbon per kilometer. For consistency with the other emissions data in this appendix, the figures have been converted here to grams of CO per kilometer. 2",
        "212 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation sions from fuel combustion in 2003 totaled 25.0 billion tonnes (IEA 2005). The transport sector accounted for 5.9 billion tonnes, or 23.6 percent of this total (IEA 2005).4 Another IEA publication (IEA 2006) provides “ref- erence case”projections of emissions for 2050.According to that report, total CO emissions from fuel consumption in 2050 will be 57.6 billion 2 tonnes (IEA 2006).Transport sector emissions will be 11.7 billion tonnes, or 20.3 percent of this total. The two IEA publications just cited do not provide a high level of modal detail. However, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s Sustainable Mobility Project (SMP) has published detailed modal estimates of emissions from fuel combustion for 2000 and projec- tions at 5-year intervals to 2050 (World Business Council for Sustainable Development 2004).5 The SMP also published estimates and projections of CO ,N O,and CH emissions from the production and distribution of 2 2 4 transport fuels. The SMP’s figures were generated by a model that was benchmarked to the IEA transport sector totals.Table B-1 shows the esti- mates and projections generated by this model. Light-duty passenger vehicles (LDVs), consisting of passenger cars, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and minivans, account for the largest share of transport-related emissions.This will continue to be the case even in 2050 ifpresent trends continue.However,emissions from other modes, notably air transport and trucks used to haul freight, are extremely significant and are projected to grow faster than emissions from LDVs. The SMP report also provides estimates and projections of transport- related emissions by country/region. These are shown in Figure B-1. The United States is included in the region “OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] North America”along with Canada and Mexico. One notable feature of Figure B-1 is the differences in relative growth rates of emissions within different countries/regions.Generally speaking, 4These are emissions from fuel combustion. 5The documentation for this model, as well as the model itself, can be found at www. sustainablemobility.org. The SMP characterizes its projections as what might occur “if present trends continue.” For a description of what is meant by the phrase “if present trends continue,” see Box 2.1 in the SMP report (p. 27).

        "214 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation emissions from countries not presently members of the OECD are pro- jected to grow much more rapidly than emissions from countries that are members of the three OECD regions. The factors responsible for this faster growth are discussed in more detail below. IEA estimates that U.S.transport-sector emissions from fuel combus- tion in 2003 totaled 1.8 billion tonnes, of which road transport (LDVs, motorized two- and three-wheelers, buses, medium- and heavy-duty trucks) accounted for 85 percent. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides estimates having a greater level of modal detail (see Table B-2).Comparison ofthe figures from Table B-2 with those from Table B-1 implies that in 2003,U.S.transport emissions of CO from fuel 2 combustion accounted for 30 to 31 percent of total world transport CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion,depending on whether international avi- ation and marine bunkers are included.6The emissions factors developed by the SMP for the production and distribution of each type of transport fuel suggest that including fuel cycle emissions would add another 17.5 percent to the U.S.total (and 15.0 percent to the world total). EPA does not publish projections offuture emissions at a similar level of detail. And, as already noted, the SMP’s projections are for OECD North America (i.e., the United States, Canada, and Mexico).According to the SMP data in Figure B-1,OECD North American transport-related emissions will have fallen from 37 percent of the world transport-related total to 26 percent by 2050.This decline in share is accounted for not by any absolute reduction in North American emissions but by the much more rapid rate of growth projected for emissions in regions (other than the other two OECD regions) outside North America. STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING TRANSPORT-RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS The charge to the committee quoted above recognizes that a range of possible approaches exist by which transport-related GHG emissions 6“International aviation and marine bunkers” denotes fuel loaded on transport vehicles in the United States but consumed in international operations. Generally speaking, “international bunkers” are not included in national totals, though they are included in the world totals cited above. The IEA estimates that in 2003, the combustion of international aviation bunkers accounted for 359 million tonnes of CO emissions. The combustion of international marine 2 bunkers is estimated to have accounted for 459 million tonnes of CO emissions. 2",

        "216 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation might be reduced. The committee believes that the best way of organiz- ing the present discussion of this range of approaches is through the use of the “ASIF decomposition.”The CO emissions from fuel combustion 2 by transport vehicles can be characterized by the following equation: G =A∗S∗I∗F i i i,j where G=CO emissions from fuel combustion by transport; 2 A=total transport activity; S =modal structure of transport activity; i I =energy consumption (fuel intensity) ofeach transport mode;and i F =GHG emissions characteristics of each transport fuel (i = trans- i,j port mode,j = fuel type). The product of the first two variables on the right-hand side of this equation, A and S, is the demand for transport services provided by i transport mode i. The product of the last two variables, I and F , is the i i,j GHG generated by each unit of transportation service provided by mode i using fuel type j.7 Historically, the primary driver of transport-related GHG emissions has been the growth oftotal transport activity (A).The primary offsetting factor has been a reduction in the energy required to produce each unit of transport services (I). However, improvements in transport energy effi- ciency have been overwhelmed by the increase in transport activity. Changes in the modal structure of transport activity (S) have tended to boost GHG emissions in two ways.First,activity has tended to shift from less energy-intensive transport modes (e.g.,rail) to more energy-intensive modes (e.g., truck). Second, in some modes (e.g., LDVs), the load factor (the percentage of vehicle capacity actually utilized) has fallen sharply.8 Changes in the emissions characteristics of transport fuels (F) have had little impact one way or another. 7This formulation was originally popularized by Lee Schipper. This particular version is taken from IEA (see IEA 2000, 22). 8In both trucking and air transport, improvements in average load factors have tended to offset some of the impact of the inherently higher energy intensiveness of the mode. The energy intensiveness of the modes (I) has increased somewhat as a result. (It takes more energy to move heavier average loads.) But the increase in energy required is considerably less than proportional to the increase in load.",

Level and Rate of Growth of Real per Capita Income Transportation activity both drives and is driven by the level and rate ofgrowth ofreal per capita income.This should not be surprising.Transportation services are a major enabler ofeconomic growth,and as people become wealthier,they find more reasons to travel.Figure B-4 shows the relationship between real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and per capita personal travel in 2000 for the countries/regions included in the SMP report.13 In 2000,the average resident of an OECD country traveled 5.7 times as many kilo- meters per year as did the average resident of a non-OECD country—a slightly lower ratio than that between the average real per capita incomes of the two country groupings. 13Similar data for goods transport activity are not provided because the information on waterborne origin–destination pairs needed to assign that important transport activity to countries/regions is lacking. )mk fo sdnasuoht( ytivitcA levarT lanosreP atipaC reP FIGURE B-4 Per capita personal travel activity versus per capita real income.

Rate of Population Growth The projected trends in real per capita income growth, if realized, will be a powerful force serving to increase transport activity. However, another factor that has exerted a powerful influence in increasing transport activity in the recent past—population growth—will be waning in importance in the future. Population growth rates are falling everywhere.This should not be sur- prising.Figure B-6 illustrates how extraordinary population growth during the last halfofthe 20th century truly was.This explosion ofworld popula- tion was caused by reduced mortality in the less developed regions—a reduction that was not accompanied (at least initially) by declining fertil- ity rates in these regions. One major factor enabling this rapid growth in population was the increased ability to transport food, especially by ship and rail. The growth in population, together with improved transport, stimulated the demand for finished goods.

        "222 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 20th century,the rate ofpopulation growth began to fall,largely because of declines in fertility. As with real per capita income growth, the pattern of population growth over the period 2000–2050 will differ by region. As a result ofsharp fertility declines,the average age ofthe population in many countries will be rising. In 1950, the median age of the world’s population was 23.5 years. It is estimated to have increased to 28.1 years by 2005,and by 2050 is projected to reach 37.8 years.14 Share of Population Residing in Urban Areas Most personal travel is within or between urban areas.Urban areas depend on transport systems to supply them with food,energy,raw materials,and finished goods.It is not surprising,therefore,to find a link between urbanization and trans- port activity. In 1950,about half of the people in the more developed regions lived in cities15 (see Table B-3). By 2000 this figure had increased to nearly 75 percent.16However,the growth in urbanization is tapering offin the coun- tries of the more developed regions.In the next 30 years,the percentage of people living in urban areas in these countries will increase only to 82 per- cent. The total urban population in these regions will experience a relatively small increase, with most of that increase occurring in North America (the United States and Canada).17In contrast,urban populations in countries located in the less developed regions will grow rapidly. Spatial Organization ofUrban Areas (Urban Form) The spatial organi- zation of urban areas exerts an independent influence on the total volume ofpersonal and goods transport activity,as well as on modal choice.When 14The median age of the U.S. population, which was 30.0 years in 1950, is estimated to have reached 36.1 years by 2005 and is projected to grow to 41.1 years by 2050 (UN 2005, Table VIII-12). 15The categorization of countries into those located in “more developed regions” and “less developed regions” is used by the United Nations “for statistical convenience and [does] not necessarily express a judgment about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the developing process” (UN 2005, ii). Generally speaking, countries in the more developed regions are members of the OECD, while those in the less developed regions are not. But there are some important exceptions. Russia and the European portions of the former Soviet Union are included in the more developed regions but are not OECD members. Mexico, South Korea, and Turkey are OECD members but are designated by the United Nations as being in the less developed regions. 16In 2000, 80 percent of the U.S. population lived in metropolitan areas as defined by the U.S. Census. 17The figure for the United States is projected to increase to 87 percent by 2030 (UN 2003, Tables A-3 and A-5).",

How the Spatial Organization of Urban Areas Affects and Is Affected by Transport Activity and Modal Availability Throughout history, the size and shape of cities have been constrained by the ability of their transport systems to supply them with food and raw materials,to enable their res- idents to congregate in numbers sufficient to convert these raw materials",
        "224 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation into finished goods efficiently and to conduct other business requiring face-to-face interaction, and to transport their finished goods to distant markets. The development of inexpensive waterborne transportation eased the first and third of these constraints.But cities were still severely limited in size by their ability to move people from their homes to work and back on a daily basis. Until roughly the middle of the 19th century, the area of a city like London was constrained by the distance people could walk from home to work.18 The development of railways linking the suburbs and the central business district (CBD),together with the development ofmeans ofmov- ing masses of people underground within the CBD, enabled Londoners and residents of other major cities to live much greater distances from their work. However, the availability of these modes of high-speed pub- lic transport did not necessarily change the need for people’s activities other than commuting to be located within a relatively short distance of where they lived. Only when automobile availability became widespread did the location constraints on these other activities ease. Indeed, noncommute activities now account for the majority of personal trips and miles traveled in most high-income countries.Table B-4 illustrates this point for the United States with data from the 2001 National Personal Transportation Survey. The spatial organization of urban activity also affects and is affected by goods transport. Before the advent of the automobile and the truck, nearly all large cities had a single, relatively compact CBD where a large share of the city’s employment was concentrated. (In the terminology used by urban planners,these cities were “monocentric.”) The location of the CBD was usually determined by its proximity to waterborne (and later to rail) transportation. The development of the motorized truck freed CBDs from these constraints. Thus, the widespread ownership of motorized road vehicles allowed workers to both live and work almost anywhere they wished within a metropolitan region. The resulting decline in average residential and employment densities has undermined the viability of public transport, 18Indeed, the first traffic count of people entering the 1 square mile City of London between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. (1854) found that horse-drawn omnibuses were the means by which the largest number of people (44,000) were transported into town; 31,000 arrived by train; and 26,000 entered by using private carriages or hackney cabs. But all these modes of transport were dwarfed by the 200,000 who walked.",

Only cities that have managed to maintain strong CBDs and that developed high-speed public transport systems before the automobile came to dominate personal travel have managed to keep the share of commuting travel by private car relatively low.19 And this is only true for workers traveling to work in the CBD; those with jobs outside the CBD generally commute to work by car. Magnitude of the Impact of the Spatial Organization of Urban Areas on Transport Activity and Modal Choice Studies have demonstrated a statis- tically significant relationship between the spatial organization of urban areas and the volume ofpersonal travel activity.But just how quantitatively significant is this relationship? Two recent U.S.studies provide information on this question. A Transportation Research Board policy study is also under way that is examining the relationships among development pat- terns,vehicle miles traveled (VMT),and the energy conservation benefits of denser development patterns. Ewing et al. (2002) ranked 83 U.S. cities in terms of a “sprawl index” composed of four components:residential density;the neighborhood mix of homes, jobs, and services; the strength of activity centers and down- towns;and the accessibility ofstreet networks.They compiled information on the rate of vehicle ownership,the share of commuters taking transit to work,the share ofcommuters walking to work,the average commute time, 19The share of commuters working in Manhattan who drive to work is just over 10 percent.

They used these characteristics, plus other control variables, to predict the average VMT per household, the average probability ofdriving to work by workers,and the average annual commute miles for the “average U.S. household” if it resided in each urban area. Table B-6 shows these predicted values for six U.S. urban areas:Atlanta,Boston,Chicago,Houston,New York,and San Diego.The difference in predicted average annual VMT per household between Atlanta and Boston (the latter being the “most compact”urban area other than New York City) is 25 percent (16,899 versus 12,704 VMT).The pre- dicted average probability of driving to work by workers does not fall below 70 percent for any city except New York City.The average number of commute miles driven per year ranges between 4,500 and 5,600 miles. The differences in transport activity and modal choice among U.S. urban areas reported in the above two studies are not trivial, but they need to be placed in perspective.Cities change slowly,and their changes are heavily path dependent.Transforming a city with the spatial organi- zation of Atlanta into one with the spatial organization of Boston would be a tremendous task requiring many decades, if it could be accom- plished at all.Making marginal changes over time might be practical,but even this would not be easy. Moreover, marginal changes are likely to yield only marginal results. Impact of Telecommuting and the Internet on Travel Demand Some have argued that the development of telecommuting and the Internet could reduce travel demand significantly.This does not appear to be hap- pening.Mokhtarian (2003) summarizes the evidence as follows: Overall, substitution, complementarity, modification, and neutrality within and across transportation modes are all happening simultane- ously. The net outcome of these partially counteracting effects, if current trends continue,is likely to be faster growth in telecommuni- cations than in travel,resulting in an increasing share of interactions falling to telecommunications,but with continued growth in travel in absolute terms.The empirical evidence to date is quite limited in its ability to assess the extent of true causality between telecommunica- tions and travel, and more research is needed in that area. At this point,what we can say with confidence is that the empirical evidence",

My expectations for the future are largely predicated on the assumption that the real price oftravel will continue to decline or at least remain relatively stable. Should the price of travel escalate markedly ... the substitutability of telecommunications will obviously become more attractive.Shifts towards telecommunications substitution may also occur for reasons such as an increasing societal commitment to more environmentally benign or sustainable communications modes, but experience suggests that such impacts will be modest at best.(p.54) Personal and Goods Transport Demand:Summary Growth in personal and goods transport demand is the most important single factor driving the increase in transport-related GHG emissions.This growth is being propelled by growth in real GDP per capita,by population growth, by urbanization, and by the spatial organization of urban areas (urban form).The latter factor is also causing shifts in modal use (public transport to LDVs for personal transport and rail to truck for goods trans- port) that likewise serve to boost transport-related GHG emissions. The correlation between economic growth and increased transport demand has proved to be very robust,but it is not immutable.Reducing it would be a slow process that would require substantial changes in almost every aspect of people’s lives. This does not mean that efforts to induce change should not be made;it does mean that such efforts would not likely bear immediate fruit. Reducing Vehicle Energy Consumption per Unit of Transport Activity (I) Hundreds (if not thousands) of studies describe and analyze the poten- tial of various technologies to reduce the fuel consumption of transport vehicles. Most of these studies focus on personal vehicles—by far the most numerous road vehicles. The majority of the studies also give the",
        "230 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation greatest attention to improvements in power train technologies. No attempt is made here to provide an encyclopedic account of the results presented in this vast body of material.Rather,the discussion is confined to broad categories of technologies. Addressed in turn are technologies with the potential to reduce the fuel consumption of road vehicles,those with the potential to reduce the fuel consumption of nonroad vehicles, factors influencing the extent to which the potential of a technology to reduce transport-related GHG emissions is realized, and the impact of vehicle capacity utilization (load factor) on energy use. Technologies with the Potential to Reduce the Fuel Consumption ofRoad Vehicles22 Road vehicles (automobiles, trucks of all sizes, buses, and powered two- and three-wheelers) account for 76 percent of all transport energy use worldwide and for 82 percent of U.S. transport energy use. LDVs (cars, light trucks,and powered two- and three-wheelers) account for the lion’s share of this total—46 percent worldwide and 62 percent for the United States.Most of the remainder—24 percent worldwide and 20 percent for the United States—is accounted for by medium and heavy freight trucks. Engine Technologies Road vehicles utilize one of two fundamental engine technologies—spark ignition or compression ignition.Other tech- nologies, such as gas turbines, have been tried, but have proved unsatisfactory for powering road vehicles.There are,however,a very lim- ited number of vehicles powered solely by electric batteries. Spark-Ignition Internal Combustion Engines Most spark-ignition engines in use today are fueled by petroleum gasoline,but they also can run on syn- thetic gasoline derived from gas-to-liquid processes,on ethanol (or blends of gasoline and ethanol), on compressed natural gas, on liquefied petro- leum gases,or on hydrogen. In the intake system ofspark-ignition engines,air is mixed with small amounts of fuel.In the past,this process was carried out in the carbure- tor, where the fuel was drawn into the airflow mechanically. To meet more stringent emissions requirements,the carburetor has been replaced in nearly all engines by port-injection systems or direct-injection sys- tems. The latter are particularly effective in reducing fuel consumption 22The material in this section is an edited version of IEA 2006, Chapter 5.",
        "Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 231 and CO emissions; this is especially true for several combustion tech- 2 nologies now in development,such as lean-burn technologies.23 Conventional engine architectures use valves activated mechanically by one or more camshafts to control the gas flow into the combustion chamber and the expulsion of the exhaust gases.Variable valve control is an advanced system that allows better management of valve timing and substantially reduces the need for the throttle plates in gasoline engines. Some mechanical systems for valve timing have already been introduced. Other systems, based on electromagnetic or electrohydraulic actuation technologies, are currently being developed. Variable valve control can also enable modular use of the engine,completely obviating the need for some of the cylinders when little engine power is required.This solution diminishes fuel consumption even further and has already been intro- duced in some large cars. Controlled auto ignition (CAI) is another new combustion process being actively explored to improve fuel economy and lower the exhaust emissions of spark-ignition internal combustion engines. CAI engines use a highly diluted mixture of fuel,air,and residual gases that can auto- ignite in a four-stroke engine without preheating of the intake air or an increase in the compression ratio. Technologies that reduce or eliminate pumping losses and throttled operations,combined with turbochargers and technologies that help con- tain knock,can result in significant reductions in engine size,also allowing substantial fuel economy improvements and reductions in CO emissions. 2 Many in the automotive industry believe engine downsizing—including the use of turbochargers—can reduce engine displacement size by up to 30 percent.Downsizing the engine also has a positive effect on the whole vehicle design,reducing vehicle inertia and therefore engine load. Almost all recent-model vehicles equipped with a spark-ignition engine are fully capable with low-level ethanol fuel blends,such as E5 or E10 (5 percent and 10 percent ethanol blends,respectively).To use blends ofmore than 10 percent ethanol,some engine modifications may be nec- essary because of ethanol’s low compatibility with certain materials and elastomer components. Using compatible materials would eliminate 23A lean-burn engine is designed to operate with a very high air-to-fuel ratio under light-load conditions. When little power is required, lower amounts of fuel are injected into the combustion chamber, only in the area around the spark. This reduces the need for throttling and limits NO. x",
        "232 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation these problems,and the use ofsuch materials is already common in some countries,such as the United States and Brazil.The cost of making vehi- cles fully compatible with E10 is negligible,and the cost remains very low for full compatibility with E85 (an 85 percent ethanol fuel blend.) If engines were designed exclusively for pure ethanol or ethanol-rich blends, their costs would be roughly the same as today, but their fuel economy (expressed in liters ofgasoline equivalent per 100 km) would be better than that of engines designed for conventional gasoline with the same performance.24 Similar effects would be seen in CO tailpipe emis- 2 sions.These improvements are possible because the high octane number of ethanol-rich blends,along with the cooling effect from ethanol’s high latent heat of vaporization, would allow higher compression ratios in engines designed for ethanol-rich blends,especially those using the most advanced injection systems available, such as direct-injection systems. Technologies such as direct injection and turbochargers that could lead to downsizing of spark-ignition engines also favor the introduction of ethanol as a transportation fuel. Compression-Ignition Engines Compression-ignition engines (commonly known as diesel engines) are similar to four-stroke spark-ignition engines, with a few essential differences.One difference is that they do not need to be controlled by a throttle.Instead,the power output is controlled by the amount of fuel injected into the cylinder,without airflow limitation.This characteristic reduces the pumping losses that occur in the aspiration phase in spark-ignition engines.Diesel engines do not need spark plugs.The air- fuel mixture used in these engines self-ignites when the fuel is injected into the combustion chamber.As a result,diesel engines can run lean and reach much higher compression ratios than conventional spark-ignition engines. Diesel indirect-injection engines (the conventional injection technol- ogy used in compression-ignition engines until a few years ago) were characterized by fuel delivery in a prechamber designed to ensure proper mixing of the atomized fuel with the compression-heated air. Precise control of fuel delivery was not easy to achieve in these systems.In recent years,indirect-injection systems have been replaced by common-rail sys- 24According to the Transportation Energy Data Book,25th edition (Davis and Diegel 2006, B-3), the combustion of a gallon of ethanol produces only about two-thirds the heat of a gallon of gasoline (75,670 Btu versus 115,600 Btu). This means a gallon of “gasoline equivalent” ethanol consists of about 1.5 gallons of actual ethanol.",
        "Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 233 tems.These systems still use a pump to store fuel at very high pressure in a reservoir (the common rail), which is connected to the combustion chamber by fuel injectors.Rail systems permit the activation of the injec- tors rather than the pump, eliminating the buildup of pressure before each individual injection.This makes it possible to control very precisely the amount of fuel injected and the timing of each injection, thereby maximizing performance and optimizing fuel use. The fact that diesel engines can work with higher compression ratios than gasoline engines and without a throttle favors the use of intake-air compressors,usually in the form of turbochargers.Such compressors are generally coupled with intercoolers and aftercoolers to increase the den- sity of the air entering the combustion chamber. Turbocharged diesel engines,working with common rail and direct injection,are now an estab- lished technology. They equip most of the light-duty diesel vehicles sold in Europe and virtually all new heavy-duty trucks sold around the world.25 Two important barriers to the increased use of diesel engines have been their relatively high emissions of particulate matter and NO . A x modern exhaust system for diesel engines includes a two-way oxidation catalyst and,in the most recent versions,a particulate filter.26The two-way oxidation catalyst is similar to the catalytic converter used in gasoline- fueled cars. It converts unburned hydrocarbons and CO into CO and 2 water.These converters are not as effective as those used in gasoline-fueled vehicles. On the other hand, CO and hydrocarbon emissions from com- pression-ignition engines are inherently low because of the leaner fuel mixture.Oxidation catalysts reduce particulate mass by as much as 50 per- cent. The problem of ultrafine particulates, one of the most dangerous emissions in terms of health effects,remains unresolved at this point. The aftertreatment of NO emissions in diesel engines presents a diffi- x cult technical challenge because of the oxygen-rich state of the exhaust under lean conditions. The formation of NO can be reduced by using x cooled intake-air compression (whereby an intercooler and aftercooler lower the temperature ofthe air-to-fuel mix in the cylinder) and by exhaust 25Variable valve control, already described for gasoline engines, also offers improvements in diesel engines, although its ability to reduce fuel consumption is lower for compression-ignition engines than for spark-ignition engines because the latter suffer from higher pumping losses. 26A diesel particulate filter may take the form of a ceramic honeycomb monolith. It may also consist of sintered metal, foamed metal structures, fiber mats, or other materials. It removes particulate from the diesel exhaust by physical filtration, capturing the particulate matter on its walls.",
        "234 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation gas recirculation.Research in the field ofaftertreatment systems continues, including efforts to integrate NO reduction with particulate filters. x Hybrid Vehicles The term “hybrid”refers to any vehicle that can use dif- ferent energy sources in combination. Currently, the term usually refers to hybrid-electric vehicles,27which are powered by a drivetrain that com- bines a conventional internal combustion engine (powered by gasoline, diesel,or an alternative fuel) and an electric motor.Hybrid-electric vehi- cles can be built in a range of engine architectures with varying sizes for the combustion engine and electric motor,each of which involves differ- ent trade-offs in terms of cost,efficiency,and performance. In series hybrids, an electric motor drives the wheels and derives its energy from a battery or an engine, generally an internal-combustion engine,used as a power generator.28The power generator supplies the aver- age power required to operate the vehicle and accessories,while a battery stores the excess energy and provides it when needed.Like electric vehicles, series hybrids may use regenerative braking to recharge the battery.A fur- ther efficiency gain is achieved by the fact that the engine is largely uncoupled from the load because ofroad conditions and can be kept work- ing at a range of operating points where its efficiency is high.This type of engine use offers advantages for the aftertreatment of exhaust gases. In parallel hybrids,motion is delivered to the wheels by both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor.The internal combustion engine is no longer used exclusively as a power plant, but works jointly with the electric motor to deliver movement to the vehicle.“Mild”parallel hybrids have an electric motor that acts as a starter and can serve as an alternator during braking (regenerative braking),while an internal combustion engine powers the drivetrain.In mild hybrid configurations,the electric motor may also provide extra torque and extra power when needed.The electric motor used in mild hybrids is usually located between the engine and the trans- mission or,in “light”designs,in the same position as a standard alternator. Full hybrids can operate in internal-combustion mode, in hybrid mode,or even in all-electric mode,the latter being used mainly for cold starts and for urban driving at ranges below 50 km.The electric energy is stored in large batteries during the periods ofinternal combustion engine 27There are hybrid vehicles that use hydraulic fluid rather than batteries as a power “accumulator.” 28Diesel-electric railroad locomotives are series hybrids. Their diesel engine drives a generator that provides power to electric traction motors.",
        "Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 235 driving and regenerative braking. In some cases, electricity is stored by charging the battery from the grid (plug-in hybrids). Hybrid drivetrains are a promising technology not only for LDVs but also for heavy- and medium-duty vehicles that operate locally and for urban buses. Hybrid solutions are not particularly suitable for heavy- duty trucks and intercity buses because the driving cycle ofthose vehicles is characterized by long driving periods at steady speeds. The main barrier to greater market penetration of hybrid vehicles is their cost, which is still higher than that of competing vehicles, notably diesel. In their most advanced configurations, diesel vehicles offer fuel economies not far behind those of hybrids. Reducing the cost, weight, and size of batteries is the greatest technology challenge facing hybrid development. Diesel hybrids achieve smaller reductions in fuel consumption rela- tive to hybrids that incorporate gasoline engines;nevertheless,full diesel hybrids may be the most efficient vehicles in the long run.Diesel hybrid engines will be best suited to urban buses and medium freight trucks, although further improvements in battery technology are needed for this type of application. Table B-7 shows estimates of CO emissions from new midsized U.S. 2 passenger cars equipped with the above engine technologies identified during the three time intervals 2003–2015, 2015–2030, and 2030–2050. On the basis of a 2003–2015 gasoline internal combustion engine vehicle equal to 100,Table B-8 shows an index ofthe emissions from each engine type during each of the three periods. Fuel Cell Vehicles A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water and produces electricity in the process. Fuel cell vehicles are propelled by electric motors, with electricity pro- duced within the vehicle. Proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) fuel cells are particularly suited to powering passenger cars and buses because of their fast start-up time, favorable power density, and high power-to-weight ratio. Fueled with pure hydrogen from storage tanks or onboard reformers, PEM fuel cells use a solid polymer as an electrolyte and porous carbon electrodes with a platinum catalyst.They operate at relatively low temperatures of around 80°C.This has the advantage of allowing the fuel cell to start quickly,but cooling of the cell is required to prevent overheating.The platinum cata- lyst is costly and extremely sensitive to CO poisoning.Research efforts are",

The current cost of PEM fuel cells exceeds $2,000 per kilowatt (kW), but costs could be cut to as low as $100 per kW through mass production and experience with the technology.This reduction in cost might not be sufficient, however. It is believed that the cost of fuel cells must fall to below $50 per kW to make them competitive.Achieving this cost reduc- tion would require fundamental advances in materials technology and the achievement of higher power densities for fuel cells. Onboard fuel storage is a major challenge. Existing onboard storage options do not yet meet the technical and economic requirements for making them competitive.Safety is also believed to be an issue.Gaseous storage at 350 to 700 bar29and liquid storage at −253°C are commercially 29A bar is a unit of pressure. It is equivalent to 14.5 pounds per square inch (psi). Atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi. So 350 to 700 bar would be approximately equal to 350 to 700 times atmospheric pressure, or 5,000 to 10,000 psi.",
        "238 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation available but are very costly. Solid storage (for example, using hydrides) offers potentially decisive advantages but is still under development,with a number of materials being investigated. At present, in the absence of further breakthroughs, gaseous storage at 700 bar appears to be the technology of choice for passenger cars. However,the cost of the tank is $600 to $800 per kilogram (kg) of hydro- gen (H ), and 5 kg of storage capacity is needed to provide adequate 2 range for the vehicle. Depending on the pace of technological development,the stack cost of a PEM fuel cell could decline to $35 to 70 per kW by 2030.If this were to happen,the cost of a fuel cell vehicle at that time would exceed that of a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle by $2,200 to $7,600. Determining CO emissions from hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles 2 is not straightforward.The fuel cells themselves do not produce any CO 2 emissions.However,as discussed below,the processes used to produce the hydrogen fuel can emit large quantities of CO , making the “well-to- 2 wheels” emissions from such vehicles comparable with (and sometimes even higher than) those from conventional gasoline or diesel internal combustion engines. Nonengine Technologies While reductions in engine energy use attract by far the most attention, other important technologies have the poten- tial to reduce the amount of energy required to propel a vehicle. Transmission Technologies Engines have ideal ranges of speed at which they can operate. Operating outside these ranges increases fuel con- sumption and engine wear.A vehicle’s transmission allows its engine to operate more closely to its ideal speed while permitting its driving wheels to operate at the speed the driver chooses. Transmissions use gears to reduce the speed ofthe engine to the speed ofthe wheels.The larger the number ofgears,the more likely it is that the engine will be able to operate at its ideal speed across a wide range of vehicle speeds and power requirements.But more gears mean more com- plexity and more internal friction. Until the 1970s, most LDVs in the United States had three forward gears—low,medium,and high.When fuel prices increased substantially in the late 1970s and early 1980s,vehicles generally added a fourth gear, sometimes called “overdrive.” More recently, transmissions have added electronic controls and additional speeds. Today, transmissions with six",
        "Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 239 forward speeds are being introduced,and seven-speed transmissions are not unheard of. Some vehicles are now equipped with a continuously variable trans- mission (CVT). CVTs use a system of belts and adjustable-diameter pulleys to permit an infinite number of forward gear ratios. The engine operates at a near-constant speed while the transmission adjusts contin- ually to produce the speed required for the wheels. CVTs have not yet achieved the power-handling capability to be used on the full range of LDV sizes and weights.Also,they have suffered from reliability problems. However,their use has been forecast to increase in the years ahead. Technologies to Reduce Vehicle Weight The lighter a vehicle,the less fuel it consumes.Vehicle mass can be reduced either by decreasing the size of the vehicle or by changing the materials from which it is made. Lighter cars can be propelled by lighter engines. A light power train, in turn, requires less structural support and allows further reductions in the weight of the vehicle frame,suspension,and brakes. Steel is currently the main automotive material.Over the past decade, steel made up an average of 55 percent of the weight of a fully fueled car without cargo or passengers.Most of the remaining weight is accounted for by iron (10 percent), aluminum (6 to 10 percent), and plastics. Cost and the eventual need for large investments to modify the vehicle pro- duction process are the main barriers to the increased use of lightweight materials.High-strength steel can cost as much as 50 percent more than traditional steels, but less of the material is needed to achieve the same performance.30Lighter materials such as aluminum and magnesium cost more than conventional mild steel, but their greater use could lead to improved manufacturing processes, thereby reducing manufacturing costs. Composite materials have extremely attractive properties but cost a great deal more than metals. Another source of weight reduction is the replacement of mechanical or hydraulic systems by electrical or electronic systems. Steering can be accomplished by electric motors actuated by joysticks rather than by mechanical linkages between the steering wheel and the wheels ofthe car. 30The type of steel used in vehicles has been changing. In 1977, 60 percent of the weight of the average U.S. domestic car consisted of steel, 90 percent of which was conventional steel—including cold-rolled and precoated steel.

During both years, the remainder is accounted for by high-strength steel, stainless steel, and other steels.",
        "240 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation This is known as “steering by wire.”“Braking by wire”also has been devel- oped,as has “shifting by wire”and “throttle by wire.” Lightweight technologies are being introduced progressively and will continue to be developed. Tire Technologies The energy requirements of the power train can be reduced through the use of energy-efficient tires. For an LDV, fuel con- sumption can be reduced by 3 to 4 percent through the use of currently available low-rolling-resistance tires.An additional reduction of1 to 2 per- cent in fuel consumption can be achieved by accurately monitoring tire pressure. Currently available technologies can automatically sense low pressure and inform the driver. Technologies to Improve Vehicle Aerodynamics Aerodynamic drag, which is proportional to the square of a vehicle’s speed,is the main factor deter- mining a vehicle’s need for power at high speeds.At this time,aerodynamic issues affect most seriously long-haulage heavy-duty trucks and intercity buses,and significant improvements are possible for such vehicles.At high- way speeds,aerodynamic losses are estimated to account for 21 percent of the energy use of a heavy-duty truck–trailer combination unit. Technologies to Reduce the Energy Requirements of Onboard Equipment The energy consumption ofair conditioners and other onboard appliances can account for up to halfofa vehicle’s fuel consumption under certain con- ditions. A number of efforts are under way to reduce the energy used by these devices.A particular focus has been on reducing the energy required to operate a vehicle’s air conditioning system.Installation rates for air con- ditioners,already approaching 100 percent in both North America and the OECD Pacific region,are growing rapidly in Europe.Fewer than 15 per- cent of LDVs sold in France in 1995 were equipped with air conditioning. By 2000,that rate had risen to 60 percent,and it is expected to reach nearly 100 percent by 2010. A significant barrier to greater market penetration of energy-efficient onboard components is the fact that the energy consumed by these appli- ances is not always captured in current vehicle tests.31 This reduces the incentive for manufacturers to use such devices. The public is largely unaware ofthe fuel use ofonboard appliances and the cost entailed:1 kW- 31We understand that this is not the case for the United States.",
        "Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 241 hour (kWh) of electricity generated on board costs just slightly less than 1 liter ofgasoline,exceeding by far the cost ofelectricity generated in cen- tral power plants. Technologies with the Potential to Reduce Fuel Consumption by Nonroad Vehicles While LDVs are,in the aggregate,the largest consumers oftrans- port fuel and emitters of GHGs, vehicles such as medium and heavy trucks, commercial aircraft, locomotives, and large waterborne vessels actually use much more energy per vehicle each year.In 2003,the average U.S.passenger car traveled about 12,000 miles and used about 550 gallons of fuel. The average combination truck (i.e., a tractor unit with one or more trailers) traveled about 62,000 miles and used about 12,000 gallons of fuel.The average commercial aircraft traveled about 900,000 miles and used about 2.3 million gallons offuel.32This appendix has already described technologies applicable to medium and heavy freight trucks and to buses. The discussion now turns to vehicles that do not travel on roads—aircraft, waterborne vessels,and railroad locomotives. Aircraft Commercial aircraft account for 12 percent oftransport energy use worldwide and 8 percent of that in the United States.Since the 1960s, turbine engines fueled by a light petroleum product known as jet fuel have powered virtually all new commercial aircraft. While the combustion process of these turbine engines is quite efficient, the energy required to lift an aircraft and its payload off the ground and propel it long distances at high speeds is formidable. In fact, a large share of the payload trans- ported by any aircraft is its own fuel.Not surprisingly,fuel usage and fuel costs are therefore an extremely important component of the total oper- ating cost of an air transport system,comparable in magnitude with crew costs and ownership and investment costs. In a review of historical and projected future trends in aircraft energy use, Lee et al. (2001) analyze the relative contribution of different tech- nological improvements and operational factors to reducing the energy intensity of commercial aircraft during the period 1971–1998. As mea- sured by megajoules per revenue passenger kilometer,this energy intensity has declined by more than 60 percent—an average decline ofabout 3.3 per- cent a year. 32These data were calculated from data provided in the Transportation Energy Data Book(Davis and Diegel 2006) and National Transportation Statistics 2004(BTS 2005).",
        "242 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation Three technological factors—reduced specific fuel consumption, an increase in aerodynamic efficiency, and improved structural efficiency— have been responsible for much ofthis decline.Engine efficiency improved by about 40 percent between 1959 and 1995, with most of the improve- ment being achieved before 1970 with the introduction of high-bypass engines.Other factors include higher peak temperatures within the engine, increased pressure ratios, and improved engine component efficiencies. Aerodynamic efficiency has increased by approximately 15 percent histor- ically, driven by better wing design and improved propulsion–airframe integration. Improvements in structural efficiency have contributed less, despite some improvements in the materials used to construct aircraft.As has also been true for motor vehicles, reductions in aircraft weight pro- duced by these improved materials have largely been traded off for other technological improvements and passenger comfort. Lee et al.(2001) project that over the next several decades,the energy intensity of commercial aircraft will continue to decline, but at a slower rate—1.2 to 2.2 percent per year,compared with the 3.3 percent average annual decline experienced over the past several decades. Waterborne Vessels Waterborne transport, including ocean shipping, coastal shipping,and inland waterway transport,accounts for 10 percent of transport energy use worldwide and for 4 percent of U.S.transport energy use.(The U.S.figure includes recreational uses;the world figure does not.) Almost all commercial vessels are powered by diesel engines. The engines used in large oceangoing ships are the largest ever built. These giant diesels can have up to 14 cylinders,each with a bore of980 mm and a stroke of 2,660 mm, giving the engine a displacement of nearly 1,000 liters.Most of these very large engines are classified as “slow speed.”That is, they operate at about 100 revolutions per minute and are coupled directly to the ship’s propeller,eliminating the need for reduction gears. The diesel engines powering towboats or self-propelled barges on inland waterways are much smaller—about the size of a large diesel- electric locomotive, though there may be more than one such engine. Large towboats on U.S.inland waterways are rated at over 10,500 horse- power.Fuels used by waterborne transport vehicles are “heavy”grades of diesel fuel and an even “heavier”petroleum product known as “residual fuel oil.” Typically, these fuels are higher (often much higher) in sulfur relative to other transport fuels.",

Railroad Engines33 Railroad engines account for 3 percent oftransport energy use worldwide and for 2 percent of transport energy use in the United States. Most railroad engines use electricity generated externally or diesel fuel carried on board as their primary energy source. For the world as a whole,27 percent ofenergy used by railroads is externally gen- erated electricity,59 percent is diesel,and 12 percent is coal (virtually all in China). Countries vary widely in the extent to which their railroads rely on electric power. Railroads in Canada and the United States are almost totally diesel powered.In Japan,78 percent of the rail energy used is electrical,and in Europe,61 percent.34 33The International Union of Railways conducted a project, Energy Efficiency Technology for Railways, in which a range of technologies relating to railway energy efficiency including, but not limited to, engine technologies were evaluated.

(Reprinted with permission of IMO.) Recent years have seen major improvements in the efficiency of elec- tric locomotives, brought about by the use of AC power. In the case of diesel-powered locomotives, propulsion system developments have focused primarily on improving the power, reliability, and efficiency of the diesel engines used to generate onboard electric energy,as well as the efficiency of the electric traction engines that deliver this energy to the driving wheels. In addition, diesel locomotives have become subject to emissions standards and,in some places,to noise standards. Interest is growing in the use offuel cells to provide auxiliary power for diesel locomotives. This would permit the main diesel engine to be shut",
        "Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 245 down when the locomotive is not in use but still has power needs.Idle time constitutes a surprisingly large share of the total time a diesel engine is in operation.A recent study of locomotive duty cycles on Canadian railroads found that engines were idling between 54 and 83 percent of the time. Using either fuel cells as auxiliary power units or the “hybrid” approach described above would permit engines to reduce the amount of idle time substantially. Although fuel use and emissions are much greater when a locomotive is operating at full power than when it is idling, the potential improvements in both are nontrivial. Factors Influencing the Extent to Which the Potential of a Technology to Reduce Transport-Related Greenhouse Gas Emissions Is Realized One of the most controversial issues in the debate over the use of new technologies to reduce GHG emissions is how effective these technologies will be when incorporated into actual transport vehicles in normal serv- ice. Invariably, ex post analyses of actual emissions reductions fall short (sometimes considerably short) of their original claimed potential. The discussion below reviews some of the more important factors that tend to create this result. Extent to Which a Technology’s Potential to Reduce Energy Consumption Is Incorporated into the Vehicles in Which It Is Employed Most vehicle technologies with the potential to reduce fuel consumption offer vehicle designers a range of possibilities for how they may be used.Depending on the decisions made by the designer,the share of this potential that is actu- ally used to reduce fuel consumption can vary from zero to 100 percent. The history of LDV fuel economy in the United States since the mid- 1980s provides a textbook example.The bottom line in Figure B-7 shows the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) of the new light vehicle fleet as tested by EPA. New LDV CAFE rose sharply between 1979 and 1982, increased slowly from 1983 through 1987, declined slowly from 1987 through 1994,and has remained nearly constant since. This does not mean that vehicle technologies related to fuel consump- tion have failed to improve since the mid-1980s. EPA uses a measure known as ton-miles per gallon as an (imperfect) reflection of changes in the energy efficiency potential of the technologies actually incorporated into vehicles.The top line of Figure B-7 tracks this indicator.It has grown relatively steadily at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year throughout the",

What explains the sharp contrast between the two lines in Figure B-7? The briefanswer is that for much ofthe period,most ofthe fuel economy improvement potential has been used by vehicle designers to improve vehicle performance, not fuel economy. Figures B-8a and B-8b show, respectively, the evolution of passenger car and light truck acceleration performance (measured as 0–60 mph time) between 1975 and 2006. Figures B-9aand B-9bshow similar data for the evolution of vehicle iner- tia weight.35 The sharp decline in inertia weight, rather than any radical change in vehicle technology,largely explains the dramatic improvement in new vehicle fleet fuel economy that occurred between the late 1970s and the early 1980s.

By 2006, the weight of the average LDV had exceeded its 1975 level. The acceleration performance of both fleets of vehicles had improved dramatically. The 2005 edition ofthe EPA report just referenced (Heavenrich 2005) estimates the impact of vehicle weight and vehicle performance on the “laboratory” (or “as tested”) fuel consumption of new U.S. passenger cars, light trucks, and all LDVs. Table B-11, adapted from this report, shows these results.

Whatever the reason, technological improvements have not automatically translated into improved fuel economy over much of the period shown. Length of Time Required Between the First Commercial Use of a Technology and When Its Impact on Fuel Consumption Is Felt Throughout the Entire Vehicle Fleet New technologies are not intro- duced across a manufacturer’s entire fleet at one time.EPA has collected data showing the length of time required to achieve various rates of fleet penetration for successful new LDV technologies in the United States (Heavenrich 2006,62).Fifty percent penetration rates of 10 years are not unusual,and 75 percent penetration rates can easily take 20 years to achieve. Transport vehicles tend to last a long time. Half the cars built during the 1990 model year were still on the road when the 2007 model year vehi- cles were first introduced. Heavy trucks last even longer. On the basis of “minimal preliminary data,”the expected median lifetime for a model year 1990 heavy truck is 29 years (Davis and Diegel 2006,Tables 3-8 and 3-10).",
        "Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 251 Commercial aircraft are also very long-lived.DC-3 aircraft built 50 years or more ago are still in commercial service in parts ofthe world.Boeing esti- mates that 8,800 ofthe world’s fleet of17,000 commercial aircraft that were operating in 2005 will still be operating in 2025 (Boeing Company 2006,6). Table B-12 shows estimates made by MIT’s Laboratory for Energy and the Environment as to how long it might take for various new LDV tech- nologies to have a significant impact on energy use and GHG emissions. How Motorists Actually Operate Their Vehicles The way vehicles are operated has a significant influence on fuel consumption. Governments test the fuel consumption performance of LDVs on dynamometers that are programmed to follow a set sequence of actions (accelerating, stop- ping, operating at high speed, operating at low speed, etc.) for specific intervals oftime.Their ratings ofvehicles’fuel consumption are based on these tests.However,vehicle operators typically do not operate their vehi- cles as implied by these test procedures.They accelerate more rapidly,drive faster, and so on. This produces a significant gap between “as tested”and “in-use”fuel consumption.For reporting purposes (but not for regulatory compliance purposes),EPA currently adjusts “as tested”mpg downward by 15 percent to make it more comparable with the fuel economy vehicle users are likely to experience in practice. However, the agency believes that this adjustment factor, which is about two decades old, is outdated and proposes increasing it to approximately 22 percent. According to EPA, adoption of this new adjustment factor would result in the 2006 TABLE B-12 Timescales for New Light-Duty Vehicle Power Train Technologies Implementation Phase (years) Penetration Across Market New Vehicle Major Fleet Total Time Vehicle Technology Competitive Productiona Penetrationb for Impact Turbocharged gasoline engine 5 10 10 20 Low-emissions diesel 5 15 10–15 30 Gasoline hybrid 5 20 10–15 35 Hydrogen fuel cell hybrid 15 25 20 55 aAccounts for more than one-third of new vehicle production. bAccounts for more than one-third of all mileage driven.

        "252 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation U.S.new vehicle fleet’s adjusted fuel economy being reduced from its “as tested” level of 24.6 mpg (9.6 L/100 km) to 19.1 mpg (12.3 L/100 km). Using the current 15 percent adjustment factor, the adjusted fuel econ- omy for the 2006 U.S. new vehicle fleet is 21.0 mpg (11.2 L/100 km) (Heavenrich 2006,A.10–A.14). Impact ofVehicle Capacity Utilization (i.e.,Load Factor) on Energy Use In the analysis thus far, reductions in energy use per vehicle kilometer have been treated as producing corresponding reductions in energy use per passenger kilometer or tonne-kilometer.The latter two measures,not the former, represent the fulfillment of transport demand. Increasing a vehicle’s average load ofpassengers or freight,while increasing energy use somewhat, normally leads to a reduction in the energy required to pro- duce a given volume of transport services.Fitting vehicle size to demand is an important consideration in minimizing transport energy use. Different transport modes have experienced varying degrees ofsuccess in improving the capacity utilization of their vehicles. In the case of U.S. commercial aviation,the increase in average load factor from about 55 per- cent in 1975 to the 80+ percent levels being experienced today is responsible for a major share of the industry’s energy efficiency improve- ment per passenger kilometer.The average load factor offreight trucks has also increased. However, U.S. LDV load factors have shown the opposite trend.Between 1977 and 2001,the average number of occupants per vehi- cle declined from 1.9 to 1.6 passengers,or by 14 percent (Hu and Reuscher 2004,Table 16,p.31).This helps explain why the number ofBtu’s required to propel the average U.S. passenger car 1 mile fell from 9,250 in 1970 to 5,572 in 2003 (i.e., by 40 percent), while the number of Btu’s required to move one passenger 1 mile fell only from 4,868 to 3,549 (i.e.,by 27 percent) over the same period (Davis and Diegel 2006,Table 2-11,p.2–13). The percentage of a vehicle’s available capacity that can be used is the result of a complex trade-off between cost and convenience.No form of commercial transport can operate at 100 percent of capacity all the time. But as operating costs increase,people are willing to sacrifice convenience to reduce cost, and load factors rise. Public transport systems are espe- cially sensitive to this trade-off.As noted above,low residential densities and the decline of CBDs as the location of most jobs have reduced the number of people wishing to travel from one given point to another, especially during peak hours. Maintaining a level of service frequency and service coverage necessary to make public transport services attrac-",

Vehicle Fuel Consumption:Summary New technologies have the potential to reduce substantially the energy used by transport vehicles.The time required to develop,commercialize, and disseminate new vehicle technologies probably is shorter than the time required to alter the fundamental drivers of personal and goods transport demand,but it is still measured in decades.In addition,there is the problem of ensuring that the potential of new technologies to reduce energy consumption in transport is actually realized. As the example of U.S.LDVs after the mid-1980s shows,there is no guarantee that this will occur. Fuel consumption is but one of many attributes of vehicle per- formance.Unless conditions are right (or can be made right),it is possible that some (or even all) ofthis potential will end up improving these other performance attributes rather than reducing vehicle fuel consumption. Altering the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Characteristics of Transport Fuel (F) Gaseous and liquid transport fuels can be produced from a wide range of primary energy sources (see Figure B-11). Depending on the feedstock used and the production method employed, CO emissions (sometimes 2 referred to as “well-to-tank”or WTT emissions) can vary widely, some- times even being negative.As noted above,changes in the GHG emissions characteristics of transport fuels have not contributed much one way or the other to changes in transport-related GHG emissions over the past several decades. This is due to the present overwhelming dominance of petroleum-based fuels in transport and to the fact that all petroleum- based transport fuels emit approximately the same amount of CO per 2 unit ofenergy they provide (see Table B-13).In the future,however,WTT emissions are likely to have much greater significance in determining total transport-related GHG emissions. Figure B-12, from the SMP’s final report, shows estimates of the “well-to-tank,”“tank-to-wheels” (TTW, sometimes also called “tailpipe emissions”), and “well-to-wheels” (WTW) emissions (the sum of WTT and TTW emissions) generated by a wide range ofvehicle–fuel combina- tions.The figure illustrates that for transport fuels such as hydrogen and for power train technologies such as fuel cells, the WTT portion totally dominates total transport-related CO emissions. 2",

        "256 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation atmosphere by the growing of the biomass.But under plausible assumptions,net WTT CO emissions for biomass-derived fuels 2 can still be negative. • The production process for some biofuels (e.g.,ethanol from corn) generates coproducts that can displace other products that require energy to produce and whose production emits CO .How 2 these “coproduct credits”are allocated has a major impact on a biofuel’s costs,the energy required to produce it,and its WTT CO emissions (Farrell et al.2006). 2 • The production of transport fuels from nonpetroleum fossil car- bon sources (e.g.,coal or natural gas) generates substantial CO 2 emissions.However,if these emissions can be sequestered,the WTT emissions from the production of these fuels can be reduced to nearly zero. Analysts differ on how each these factors should be treated in “scoring” the WTT emissions characteristics of different transport fuels produced by different processes from different primary energy sources. Therefore, anyone reviewing the literature on this topic can expect to encounter a range of estimates.The important thing now universally acknowledged is that WTT emissions must be incorporated into any estimates of future transport-related CO emissions. 2 Fueling Infrastructure A vast supply infrastructure has developed to deliver petroleum-based transport fuels to the vehicles that utilize them. As noted earlier, motor vehicles can use some alternative fuel blends (e.g., E5 and E10) without major modifications either to their engines or to their fuel systems. The same is true of the current fuel supply infrastructure.Today’s petroleum product pipelines routinely carry gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and propane.They also can carry “mild”blends ofgasoline and biofuels (such as E5 and E10).But they cannot carry blends consisting of a majority of biofuels (such as E85) or 100 percent ethanol.The only gaseous transport fuel carried by pipeline is natural gas. Other gaseous transport fuels (in particular,hydrogen) would require dedicated pipelines. Another very important part of the transport fuel infrastructure is the fueling stations that actually deliver fuel to vehicles.Most of these are",
        "Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 257 not directly connected to a pipeline. Instead, they are supplied by tank trucks that haul fuel from a distributing point (that is connected to a pipeline) to individual fueling stations. One of the most formidable challenges facing any new transport fuel would be the establishment of an infrastructure capable of distributing it widely. The enormous fixed costs involved in establishing such an infrastructure mean it would not be established without assurance that the demand for the products it would transport would be forthcoming. Yet the vehicles that would be the source of this demand would not be built and purchased without assurance that fuel to power them would be available. Efforts are being made in some states to establish “hydrogen high- ways.”These are routes along which enough hydrogen refueling stations have been established to permit drivers of hydrogen-fueled vehicles to travel on them. These stations are supplied by tanker trucks. While this could help build initial demand for hydrogen as a transport fuel,it is not a long-term solution to the fuel infrastructure problem. HOW MUCH AND OVER WHAT TIME PERIOD MIGHT TRANSPORT-RELATED GHG EMISSIONS BE REDUCED? This appendix has described a wide range of technological and non- technological means of reducing transport-related GHG emissions. In this final section, the committee attempts to indicate how much transport-related GHG emissions might be reduced given the trends thus far described. As stated at the outset, the fundamental challenge is to reduce the emissions produced per unit of transportation services provided more rapidly than the demand for transportation services grows.While it may be possible to reduce the rate of transportation demand growth some- what without harming economic growth unacceptably,the committee is aware of no forecast that projects that transportation demand will fail to grow relatively rapidly in the decades ahead, especially in many of the world’s less developed countries.The bulk ofthe responsibility for reduc- ing emissions will therefore fall on improved vehicle technologies and low-carbon or carbon-free fuels. There is considerable uncertainty about what it might cost to com- mercialize and widely disseminate many of the more advanced vehicle",
        "258 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation technology and fuel solutions. Given what is known about projected demand growth, however, it is possible to simulate what might be feasi- ble trajectories of advances in vehicle technology and fuel substitution. To obtain a better sense of the potential impact of various technolo- gies and fuels in reducing transport-related GHG emissions, the SMP conducted a number of simulations using its spreadsheet model. The benchmark was the SMP reference case projection showing total trans- port-related CO emissions doubling between 2000 and 2050,with most 2 of the growth in emissions occurring in the countries of the developing world. While other analyses have examined this issue for individual developed countries or regions, to the committee’s knowledge, the SMP was the first to examine it for the world as a whole. In these simulations,the focus was on total road transport.The exer- cise did not examine the technical or economic feasibility of any of the actions being simulated. It was intended merely to help the SMP under- stand the impact on GHG emissions from road vehicles if the actions described were taken. This enabled the SMP to compare its results with those of other studies that likewise did not consider technical or economic feasibility in deriving their results. Single-Technology Simulation The SMP began by examining the impact of single technologies on CO 2 emissions from road transport worldwide.Figure B-13 shows results for five such technologies—dieselization, hybridization, fuel cells,“carbon- neutral” hydrogen, and biofuels. It was assumed that each power train technology would achieve as close to 100 percent global sales penetration as possible given the characteristics of the technology and that each fuel would become as close to 100 percent of the global road transport fuel pool as its characteristics would permit. The SMP emphasized that these single-technology examples were purely hypothetical.It is highly unlikely in practice that any single tech- nology would achieve 100 percent penetration.Also,the examples cannot be added together. Differences in the timing of the implementation of these technologies and fuels in the developed and developing worlds were largely ignored. For both diesels and advanced hybrids,it was assumed that 100 per- cent sales penetration would be reached by 2030 and that these technologies",

Diesel internal combustion engine technology (using conventional diesel fuel) was assumed to have an 18 percent fuel consumption benefit compared with the prevailing gasoline internal sGHG tnelaviuqE-OC sennotagiG 2 Reference Case Diesels Hybrids Fuel Cells (hydrogen from natural gas) Fuel Cells (zero-carbon hydrogen) Advanced Biofuels (all road vehicles) FIGURE B-13 Hypothetical potential of individual technologies to lower road transport well-to-wheels GHG emissions relative to the SMP reference case. (Source:World Business Council for Sustainable Development 2004, Figure 4.7, p. 113.) 36A very high proportion of heavy trucks and buses are already diesel powered. The SMP assumed that hybrid technology would not see significant use in heavy-duty over-the-road trucks and buses because of their operating characteristics. Public transport buses are already being viewed as prime candidates for hybridization. These were not included in the SMP’s calculation, but their omission makes relatively little difference in the results. 37The SMP made the same assumptions concerning the types of vehicles to which fuel cells might be applied as it did for hybrids.",
        "260 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation combustion engine technology during the entire period. The fuel con- sumption benefit relative to gasoline internal combustion engine technology was assumed to be 36 percent for diesel hybrids, 30 percent for gasoline hybrids,and 45 percent for fuel cell vehicles. From this single-technology assessment, it is evident that even if implemented worldwide,diesels and hybrid internal combustion engines fueled with conventional gasoline and diesel fuel or fuel cells fueled with natural gas–derived hydrogen could no more than slow the growth in road transport CO emissions during the period 2000–2050.Only the use 2 of carbon-neutral hydrogen in fuel cells and advanced biofuels in inter- nal combustion engine–powered vehicles could largely or totally offset the increase in CO emissions produced by the growth in road travel dur- 2 ing the period 2000–2050. This does not mean that vehicle energy use characteristics are irrele- vant. They might not have a major impact on the trajectory of road vehicle GHG emissions over the very long term, but they would have a major impact on the amount of low-carbon or carbon-neutral fuel that would have to be produced to power the world’s road vehicle fleet. This means they could have a very important impact on the cost of signifi- cantly reducing GHG emissions from road vehicles.38 On the basis of these results, the SMP concluded that it is only through a combination of fuel and power train solutions that significant CO reduction can be attained. No single-technology pathway merits 2 selection as the sole long-run solution. Combined-Technology Simulation Since the substantial reduction of CO emissions from road vehicles is 2 likely to depend on the widespread adoption of several advanced vehicle and fuel technologies,as well as other factors,the SMP decided to exam- ine the combined impact of several actions,including the following: • Fuels that are carbon neutral (defined by the SMP as ones that reduce WTW CO emissions by at least 80 percent); 2 • Power trains that are highly energy efficient; 38The fuel economy benefit relative to gasoline internal combustion engine technology was assumed to be 36 percent for diesel hybrids, 30 percent for gasoline hybrids, and 45 percent for fuel cell vehicles.",
        "Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 261 • A change in the historical mix-shifting trend to larger vehicle cat- egories;and • Improved traffic flow and other changes in transport activity resulting from better integration of transport systems,enabled,at least in part,by information technology. The SMP set an illustrative target ofreducing annual worldwide CO emis- 2 sions from road transport by halfby 2050.This is equivalent to a decline in yearly CO emissions ofabout 5 gigatonnes from levels that the SMP refer- 2 ence case projects would otherwise be reached and,by coincidence,returns annual road vehicle CO emissions in 2050 to about their current levels. 2 For illustrative purposes, the CO reduction target was divided into 2 six increments.The timing and size of each increment are not fixed and ultimately would be decided on the basis ofsustainability and investment choices at the national, regional, and global levels. The purpose of the analysis was to illustrate what might be achieved if ambitious changes were made beyond those in the SMP reference case,with no judgment as to cost or the probability of each step being taken. Increment 1. Dieselization:It was assumed that dieselization ofLDVs and medium-duty trucks would rise to around 45 percent globally by 2030 (that is, to about current European levels). Diesel engines were assumed to consume about 18 percent less fuel (and emit 18 percent less CO ) than current gasoline internal combustion engines. 2 Increment 2. Hybridization: It was assumed that the hybridization (gasoline and diesel) of LDVs and medium-duty trucks would increase to half of all internal combustion engine vehicles sold by 2030.Gasoline hybrids were assumed to consume an average of30 percent less fuel than current gasoline internal combustion engines, and diesel hybrids were assumed to consume an average of24 percent less fuel than current diesels.39 Increment 3. Conventional and advanced biofuels:It was assumed that the quantity of biofuels in the total worldwide gasoline and diesel pool would rise steadily, reaching one-third by 2050. Conventional biofuels (those yielding a 20 percent CO unit efficiency benefit) were capped at 2 39It is generally acknowledged that, because of the diesel’s initial superior energy efficiency, any additional benefit from hybridizing a diesel is likely to be smaller than that from hybridizing a gasoline engine.",
        "262 Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Transportation 5 percent of the total pool.The balance was assumed to be advanced bio- fuels (those yielding at least an 80 percent CO unit efficiency benefit).40 2 Increment 4. Fuel cells using hydrogen derived from fossil fuels (no carbon sequestration): It was assumed that mass market sales of LDVs and medium-duty trucks would start in 2020 and rise to half of all vehi- cle sales by 2050. It also was assumed that fuel cell–equipped vehicles consume an average of45 percent less energy than current gasoline inter- nal combustion engines. Increment 5. Carbon-neutral hydrogen used in fuel cells: It was assumed that hydrogen sourcing for fuel cells would switch to centralized production of carbon-neutral hydrogen over the period 2030–2050 once hydrogen LDV fleets had reached significant penetration at the country level. By 2050, 80 percent of hydrogen would be produced by carbon- neutral processes. The first five increments reflect the inherent properties of different vehicle technologies and fuels.Actual reductions in CO emissions will be 2 determined not only by these properties but also by the mix of vehicles purchased by consumers and businesses and by how these vehicles are used on a daily basis. To reflect these two factors, two more increments were included. Increment 6. Additional improvement in fleet-level vehicle energy efficiency:The SMP reference case projects an average improvement in the energy efficiency of the on-road LDV fleet of about 0.4 percent per year, with new vehicle sales showing an average 0.5 percent per year improve- ment in fuel economy. The improvement potential embodied in actual vehicles is around 1.0 percent per year, but about half of this potential improvement is offset because ofvehicle purchasers’preferences for larger and heavy vehicles. In developing this increment, the SMP assumed that preferences relating to the mix of vehicles chosen by purchasers and the performance of these vehicles would change somewhat, leading to an additional 10 percent average annual in-use improvement relative to the reference case (i.e., average annual fleet-level improvement would rise from about 0.4 percent to about 0.6 percent). 40This implies that these advanced biofuels are either gasoline from lignocellulosic sugar fermentation or diesel from biomass gasification/Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.",
        "Contribution to Emissions and Assessment of Strategies 263 Increment 7. A 10 percent reduction in emissions due to better traf- fic flow and other efficiencies in road vehicle use:It was assumed that the gap between on-road energy-use performance and the technological improvements embodied in vehicles would narrow.How might this hap- pen? For one thing, there are a number of opportunities relating to the increased use of information technology in transport systems that might enable the better management oftravel demand.Improved routing infor- mation might permit trips to be shortened,while improved information about road conditions might reduce the amount of time motorists spend in their vehicles while idling in traffic.For another thing,more accurate and current information about when public transport vehicles will arrive and how long they will take to get to their destinations might encourage additional use of public transport. Individually, none of these improve- ments would be major, and almost certainly there would be offsets. But in combination, the SMP assumes that such factors could produce an additional 10 percent reduction in road vehicle CO emissions. 2 Figure B-14 shows the results of the SMP combined-technologies analysis just described.It confirms the impression conveyed by the three single-technology analyses discussed above that the widespread adoption of a combination of vehicle and fuel technologies (plus other factors) would be required to return 2050 CO emissions from road vehicles to 2 their 2000 level. SUMMARY Any global warming that will be experienced during the next several decades will largely be the result of GHG emissions that have already occurred.As the main body of this report points out,regardless of what else it might do,America’s transport sector will have to adjust to the con- sequences of this warming. But the transport sector in general, and America’s transport sector in particular, is a significant source of GHG emissions.If future warming is to be limited,GHG concentrations in the atmosphere must be stabilized. This will require reducing GHG emis- sions not merely to below what they might otherwise be if present trends were to continue but to well below current levels. The transport sector will have to contribute to this reduction. This appendix has identified several approaches by which transport- related GHG emissions might be reduced. A common characteristic of",

This means that if transport-related GHG emissions are to be reduced to below their current levels by 2050, steps must be taken now to begin to implement certain of these approaches.
