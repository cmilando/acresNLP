City staff are actively engaged in the Metro Mayors Climate Preparedness Task Force and planning studies are being performed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, UMass Boston, and the American Geophysical Union. In support of these efforts, the City, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM), commissioned this climate change vulnerability assessment to: • Identify vulnerable areas of the City at risk of coastal flooding (under present day and projected future climate change conditions). • Assess flood risk and depth. • Prioritize infrastructure at risk. • Recommend adaptation measures of varying scale and complexity. The City and its partners are already advancing elements of the recommended adaptation measures and thinking creatively about how to integrate resilient approaches into future planning efforts. Each next step will help protect economic activities for the region, and critical public infrastructure and the built environment that support daily life. Executive Summary 1Figure S.1 Areas of Chelsea Vulnerable to Coastal Flooding Coastal Flooding Vulnerability With approximately 60% of its municipal boundary bordering tidally influenced waterways, Chelsea is especially vulnerable to coastal flooding. Once a network of waterways and tidelands, the low-lying areas of the City are, on average, less than 10 feet above sea level. Disruption of these natural systems by urban development has made these areas even more susceptible to coastal flooding under present day and future climate change conditions. The assessment team used the Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model (BH-FRM) to determine which areas of the City are most vulnerable to coastal flooding. The BH-FRM is a probabilistic, dynamic model, meaning that it includes the physical processes associated with storm events (e.g., waves, winds, tides, storm surge, etc.) and not just static increases in water levels (Bosma et al., 2016). BH-FRM also assesses future flood risk based on sea level rise projections and a range of potential storm events. This is the same model being used by other metro-Boston area municipalities, Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT), Massachusetts Port Authority, and other agencies. The model determines key flood pathways where coastal flood waters are predicted to enter the City. The five primary vulnerability zones within Chelsea are shown on Figure S.1. Collectively, these zones place approximately 36% of the City within a flood risk area under present day, 42% in 2030 and 49% in 2070. 2 Executive SummaryTable S.1 Prioritized Public Infrastructure Rank Asset / Facility Sector Vulnerability Zone Owner MWRA Chelsea Creek Headworks and 1 Wastewater Lower Chelsea Creek MWRA Screen House Chelsea Street Bridge over Chelsea Transportation – Roadway, 2 Lower Chelsea Creek MassDOT Creek Maritime 3 MWRA Chelsea Facility Water and Wastewater Upper Chelsea Creek MWRA MassDOT/ 4 Railroad Bridge over Mill Creek Transportation - Rail Mill Creek MBTA 5 Substation #488 at Willoughby Street Energy Upper Chelsea Creek Eversource 6 Carter Street Pump Station Stormwater Island End River City 7 Williams Middle School Buildings Island End River City 8 City Yard Buildings Island End River City 9 Burke School Complex Buildings Upper Chelsea Creek City 10 Chelsea High School Buildings Island End River City Meridian Street Bridge over Chelsea Transportation – Roadway, 11 Lower Chelsea Creek MassDOT Creek Maritime 12 Broadway Bridge over Mill Creek Transportation - Roadway Mill Creek MassDOT Critical Public Infrastructure This assessment focuses on the critical public infrastructure in each of these vulnerability zones. Critical public infrastructure included City-, State-, and private utility-owned assets that provide critical public services. The decision to focus on public infrastructure was driven by the desire to provide Chelsea with some adaptation measures that can be implemented by the City in the near term, (for example, the results of this assessment are already being used to design improvements at the Carter Street pump station and at the Island End River site, as the City owns these properties). The decision was also based on the recognition that the assessment findings would support complementary resilience planning efforts by other public service providers including the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, MassDOT, and Eversource. Although the focus was on critical public infrastructure, the potential adaptation measures identified herein provide benefits to private property as well. A total of 12 critical public infrastructure assets were identified in the vulnerability zones based on the City’s Hazard Mitigation Plan (MAPC, 2014) and input by City staff. The assets were prioritized based on a total risk score that considered asset criticality (consequence) and likelihood of flooding (probability) now and in the future. Simply put, the higher the score, the higher the priority to implement adaptation measures to protect this asset. Executive Summary 3The findings show: • All 12 assets are distributed relatively evenly among four zones, with none occurring in the Mystic River Vulnerability Zone. • Five of the 12 assets are owned by the City, and four of these are located in the Island End River Vulnerability Zone. • The public infrastructure assets that are most critical to the region are also most at risk of coastal flooding under present day and future years. Flexible Adaptation Strategies Another interesting result of the modeling is that the locations where coastal flooding enters the City are anticipated to generally remain the same over time. However, the depth of anticipated flooding and resultant impacts will increase. This finding emphasized the need for shoreline and site-specific adaptation strategies that could be implemented in the near term, and are flexible enough to work over a range of future climate change conditions. The recommended adaptation strategy height is, on average, 2 feet in year 2030 and 5 feet in year 2070. Flexible adaptation strategies considered include ecological approaches that grow with sea level rise, and natural berms and hard structures that can be adjusted vertically in height or lengthened over time. Shoreline strategies account for the need to support Chelsea’s working waterfront within the Mystic River and Chelsea Creek Designated Port Areas. Depending on the specific site, adaptable flood walls (deployable and/or permanent) may need to be set back from the waterfront to preserve waterfront access (Figure S.2). At other locations, unique hybrid installations (green and gray infrastructure) are suggested (Figure S.3) . The City is also interested in exploring policy and planning based approaches to encourage more resilient building and site design. A collection of paired measures – site specific, shoreline and policy/planning – can offer the highest level of protection. Next Steps With the impacts of climate change being experienced both locally and across the globe, the City of Chelsea is planning for sea level rise and severe weather events. Inherent in the City’s vision is creating a forum within which public and private partners can see opportunities to act together for their mutual benefit. Such an approach will create opportunities for public/private partnerships and cost sharing. The key is to promote measures at all scales, in a coordinated manner, to address coastal flooding risks in the short term and long term. The City of Chelsea is devoted to incorporating a variety of adaptation and mitigation strategies to create a cohesive and united response to climate change. 4 Executive SummaryFigure S.2 Potential Shoreline Adaptation within a Designated Port Area (DPA), where Gray Infrastructure may require setbacks to preserve waterfront access Figure S.3 Potential Shoreline Adaptation at Island End River Illustrates a “Hybrid” installation of Green Infrastructure (living shoreline) and Gray Infrastructure (retaining wall).

These higher temperatures are causing sea levels to rise and increasing the odds of natural hazards, including flooding, fire, earthquakes, landslides, and extreme storm events. The immediate concern is the implication climate change has on the natural and built environments around us. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy’s impact on New York and New Jersey revealed the severe damage that can come from an extreme weather event. Here in Massachusetts, we are already seeing a rise in sea levels and greater intensity and frequency of storms causing flooding. Coincidently, as this study began, world leaders met to negotiate and sign the world’s latest accord on climate change, the “Paris Agreement,” which set forth a new global action plan to deal with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance starting in the year 2020. Introduction 1-1Urban Resilience: 35K+ “The capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, RESIDENTS businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they 16K+ experience.” - 100 Resilient Cities pioneered by the JOBS Rockefeller Foundation With the implications of climate change and related impacts of severe weather events 1.8 accepted globally and the impacts of severe SQUARE weather being felt locally, the City of Chelsea MILES understands the importance of planning for future conditions. Based on a regional climate change model, approximately 20% of the City’s 1.8 square miles of land area is mapped within the potential coastal flooding 35% area under present day, 35% in 2030, and 45% in 2070. This footprint poses a major CITY IN 2030 FLOOD RISK threat to public safety and the quality of life AREA for people living and working in the Chelsea. It also has the potential for widespread regional impacts to the food distribution and petroleum enterprises. In light of these projections, the City of Chelsea is committed to making strategic infrastructure investments, rooted in broadly acknowledged climate science, methods, and policy, while engaging public and private partners in community-level resiliency planning discussions and future implementation phases. 1-2 Introduction2 ASSESSMENT PROCESS The goal of this study is to assess the Vulnerability: vulnerability of critical public infrastructure in “Structures, systems, populations, Chelsea, Massachusetts to coastal flooding and recommend adaptation measures to improve or other community assets as infrastructure resilience over a range of future defined by the community, that conditions. are susceptible to damage and loss Public infrastructure includes City owned assets from hazard events.” as well as state infrastructure and private utility - FEMA Local Mitigation Plan Review Guide assets that provide critical public services.

(Chapters 7 – 9) 2-2 What is the Goal of the Study?3 COASTAL HAZARD AND RISK MODELING Approximately 60% of the City's 7.8 mile municipal boundary borders tidally influenced waterways. Each of these bordering waterways -- Mystic River, Island End River, Chelsea Creek, and Mill Creek -- is part of the Mystic River Watershed which drains into Boston Harbor. Topographic mapping (Figure 3.3 on page 3-3) illustrates a The Mystic ridgeline, aligned north to southeast, dividing the City roughly River Watershed in half. From this ridgeline, water flows in the western direction includes 76 square to the Island End and Mystic Rivers, and in the eastern direction to the Mill and Chelsea Creeks. Inland from the stream's edge, a miles of land network of waterways and tidelands once flowed through what are area and 21 other now Chelsea's projected flood zones. Disruption of these natural communities. systems, by unregulated urban development, has made these areas (MyRWA, n.d.) vulnerable to coastal flooding. Coastal flooding occurs when the wind and tides overtop the shoreline and inundate low-lying areas. With an average elevation of less than ten feet above sea level, it is not surprising that approximately 20% of the City is mapped within a potential coastal flooding area in present day. Add on sea level rise projections of 0.6 feet in 2030 and 3.2 feet in 2070, and anticipated more frequent and intense storm events, this percentage increases to 35% in 2030 and 45% in 2070.

The FIRMs issued in 1974, 1982, and 2009 for Chelsea show minimal coverage of and change to the flood hazard areas. These maps illustrate the floodplain hugging the shorelines of the Mystic and Island End Rivers and include some low-lying areas adjacent to Chelsea and Mill Creeks. FEMA issued new FIRMs for Suffolk County, effective March 16, 2016. The FEMA FIRMs are included as Appendix C. Chelsea’s updated mapping shows a much larger flood risk area within the City, extending through the areas of the historic waterways shown on the 1903 mapping. Additionally, as part of the revised FEMA flood mapping process, the City of Chelsea intends to modify its Floodplain Overlay District to include the extents of the 2016 FIRM. Figure 3.2 Island End River, 2016 FEMA Map 3-2 Coastal Hazard and Risk ModelingFigure 3.3 Topographic Map and Historic Water Lines in Chelsea (MassGIS) Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model Recognizing the limitations of FEMA mapping, communities and businesses in the Metro-Boston area are now using the Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model (BH-FRM), to evaluate which of their assets are vulnerable to coastal flooding. The BH-FRM is a dynamic model, meaning that it assesses future flood risk based on sea level rise projections and a range of potential storm events. The BH-FRM was developed by the Woods Hole Group as part of a Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Pilot Project to assess the effects of climate change on the Central Artery Tunnel System. The Pilot Project report explains that the “hydrodynamic modeling is based on mathematical representations of the processes that affect coastal water levels such as riverine flows, tides, waves, winds, storm surge, sea level rise, and wave set-up, at a fine enough resolution to identify site specific locations that may require adaptation alternatives (Bosma, et. al., 2015).” The BH-FRM models the topography, infrastructure, and other relevant local landscape information. Industry leading hydrodynamic and wave models1 were coupled to depict probable future sea level elevations and simulate tides, waves, winds, velocities, and riverine flows from a variety of storm types. A more in depth discussion of the “Probabilistic Modeling of Sea Level Rise, Storm Surge, and Waves” is provided in Appendix D. Coastal Hazard and Risk Modeling 3-3Maps were created for Chelsea for present day and future years 2030 and 2070. For this project, WHG has produced two types of maps for these time periods, displaying either the probability or depth of flooding . For the depth of flooding maps, one map depicts flooding depths associated with a 1% probability level (or 100-year flood level), and another map for a 0.1% chance flood (or 1,000-year flood level – a less frequent, more intense occurrence). There is not much variation in the What is Storm Surge ? City’s probable flood footprint between 2030 and 2070. This is An abnormal rise of water generated by not surprising for two reasons. First, a storm, over and above the normal tide the flood areas are topographically constrained to the low lying areas of range. (Adapted from NOAA) the City. Second, coastal flooding in Chelsea is primarily due to still water impacts and not significant wave action. So while the flood footprint doesn’t change, the likelihood and anticipated depths of flooding do increase over time.

Sea Level Rise Projections Consistent with both the US National climate Assessment and projections specific to Massachusetts. Dynamic Coastal Processes Driven by wave effects, wind, tides, and storm surge. Figure 3.4 Mapping Coastal Flooding The mapping on pages 3-6 and 3-7 illustrate current (2013) and future (2030 & 2070) probability of coastal inundation in Chelsea, Massachusetts. Results are based on a hydrodynamic model developed for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (Famely et al. 2016). Note: This data does not take into account inland freshwater flooding. 3-4 Coastal Hazard and Risk ModelingNatural Resource Modeling It is also environmentally responsible for the City to consider the impact of sea level rise on natural resources, not just built infrastructure. The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was first developed with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funding in the 1980s. As part of the Statewide Modeling the Effects of Sea Level Rise on Coastal Wetlands Project for the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management, Woods Hole Group evaluated the impact of sea Salt Marsh level rise on wetlands and shorelines (credit: Matt Poole/USFWS, Flickr) throughout the Commonwealth. In Chelsea, the shorelines consist of tidal flats, rocky intertidal shoreline, coastal beach, coastal bank, salt marsh, shallow marsh meadow or fen, and salt marsh (see Table 3.1 below). Table 3.1 Wetland Resources Along Chelsea's Streams Wetland Resource Island End River Mystic River Chelsea Creek Mill Creek coastal beach • • • coastal bank bluff or sea cliff • • rocky intertidal shore • • salt marsh • • shallow marsh meadow or fen • tidal flats • • • • The model shows areas of likely coastal wetland loss due to higher water tables and more frequent flooding. These impacts may be mitigated by constructing living shorelines as an alternative to, or in addition to, hardened waterfront structures such as sea walls or bulkheads. Living shorelines use plants, sand, coir fiber logs, and stone to provide shoreline protection and maintain valuable habitat (www.habitat.noaa.gov). Further information on the SLAMM process and its results for Chelsea is provided in Appendix E. 1Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) models surface elevations of sea level rise and tidal effects of storm surges. SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) shows the effects of waves generated by the modeled storms.

These pathways are identifiable by the areas with a high probability of flooding on the 2030 BH-FRM mapping (10-20%, shown on Figure 4.1 on page 4-2, in color purple). Interestingly, these flood pathways mimic the historic network of waterways and tidelands that existed prior to the urban development that occurred in the mid- to late-nineteenth century. Each of the identified flood pathways puts critical public infrastructure at risk. The pathways also have the potential to impact private commercial, industrial, and residential areas throughout Chelsea. From west to east, five zones vulnerable to flooding were identified: • Island End River • Mystic River • Lower Chelsea Creek • Upper Chelsea Creek • Mill Creek In total, these vulnerability zones comprise approximately 20% of the City’s land area under present day, 35% in 2030, and 45% in 2070. This footprint poses a major threat to public safety and the quality of life for people living and working in the City. It also has the potential for widespread regional impacts to food distribution and petroleum enterprises. The following pages look at each of the five identified vulnerability zones in closer detail. Coastal Flooding in Chelsea 4-1Historic Water Line Flood Pathways Vulnerability Zones Figure 4.1 Flood Pathways and Vulnerability Zones 4-2 Coastal Flooding in ChelseaI s l a n d E n d R i v e r V u l n e r a b i l i t y Z o n e General Description 290+ ACRES IN 2030 The Island End River is a tributary to the Mystic River. The western bank is in Everett, and the eastern bank is in Chelsea. This vulnerability zone generally extends from the Island End River at Beacham/Williams Street (a major freight corridor), north to Route 16, and east beyond Route 1 to the MBTA Commuter Rail Station. This area is a significant local and regional commercial, industrial, and food distribution center. The historic path of the river once extended through the New England Produce Center into Everett, and north through the existing commercial area to Revere Beach Parkway and Route 1. These low-lying areas were once extensive tidal flats and salt marsh, but the tidelands were dammed and filled to support development in the late 19th century. The Island River has been the subject of many years of hazardous substance remediation and natural resource restoration efforts. Today, the edge of the Island End River in Chelsea is characterized by tidal flats, coastal banks and beaches. The shoreline also includes armored slopes at Admiral’s Hill Marina, and salt marsh. The Market Street culvert discharges stormwater runoff from a 119-acre catchment area in Chelsea and Everett to the River. The Carter Street pump station is currently being redesigned to redirect flows from the catchment area to nearby underground systems rather than the culvert. Stormwater flows from other portions of Everett will continue to discharge at the culvert.

The seawall and floodplain along the base of Mary O'Malley Park helps reduce the probability of flooding at lower elevations of the Admiral Hill neighborhood. The identified vulnerable area generally extends from the Tobin Bridge, east to the Meridian Street Bridge, and north to Medford Street. Here, heating oil transport/distribution operations and other industrial/light industrial uses are particularly at risk of flooding. The Chelsea Yacht Club Marina, Lower Broadway Neighborhood, and access to the Admirals Hill neighborhood are also identified on the flood model.

The MWRA owns a facility on Griffin Way, and residential neighborhoods (Shurtleff Bellingham and Mill Hill) are on the frindge of the area. Chelsea Creek is a Designated Port Area (DPA), regulated by the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (MCZM). Within DPA boundaries, properties are generally restricted to water- dependent industrial uses. Chelsea shares this section of industrial waterway with East Boston and Revere. The shoreline consists of coastal beach, riprap slopes, bulkheads and dolphins (CZM, 2015). This section of River also contains tidal flats and salt marsh.

This creek has the most natural edge of Chelsea’s waterways, lined with salt marsh and tidal flats. More than two acres of salt marsh have been restored along Mill Creek by the Chelsea Collaborative, a community organization focusing on environmental, social, and economic justice in the city (Chelsea Collaborative, n.d.). In Chelsea, the vulnerable area associated with this flood pathway extends along Mill Creek, from its confluence with Chelsea Creek, west to Route 1, and inland to Clinton Street. The Mill Hill neighborhood abuts much of the creek, while a concentration of commercial and institutional properties exists north of Broadway. Six bridges cross Mill Creek, from its origin in Revere to Chelsea Creek, including Broadway and the MBTA Commuter Rail. Portions of Revere could also be affected by this flood pathway, including the Revere Beach Parkway (Route 16).

Damage to these networks due to coastal flooding would have significant economic, social, and emergency response impacts. Roadways The road network in Chelsea includes a combination of limited access highway (US Why are Route 1), multi-lane highway (Route 16), major roadways local collectors (e.g. Broadway or Eastern Avenue), and vulnerable? minor local arterials (e.g. Cottage Street or Clinton Street).

CSX engines haul coal and merchandise including agricultural, food and consumer, chemical, automotive, metal, and forest products, as well as phosphates, fertilizers, minerals, waste and equipment. Locally, CSX serves the New England Produce Center on Beacham Street. The Pan Am Railways corridor reaches from New Brunswick, Canada to New Haven, Connecticut and Upstate New York. The local branch has rights to the MBTA line serves industries in Lynn, Salem and Peabody, and a terminal interchange in Boston. Grain, coal, sand and gravel, food products, lumber, paper and pulp, chemicals and plastics, petroleum, processed minerals, metals, scrap metal, finished automobiles and intermodal trailers and containers are all handled by Pan Am trains.

Vulnerable Infrastructure 5-3Maritime Federal maritime navigation channels extend along Chelsea Creek, Mystic River, and Island End River. Each of these waterways is used for barge transport. Chelsea Creek has been identified by state and federal officials as a critical energy pathway, crucial to providing petroleum products (gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel) to the region. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains the federal shipping channel in these waterways.

The MWRA is a Massachusetts public authority that provides wholesale water and sewer services to 2.5 million people and more than 5,500 large industrial users in 61 metropolitan Boston communities. The MWRA has over 5 miles each of water and sewer lines within Chelsea. In addition to this piping network, MWRA’s Chelsea Facility and Chelsea Creek Screen House and Headworks are located within the City limits. The City operates and maintains its own water and sewer systems. The City purchases all of its water directly from the MWRA. The water is delivered through five MWRA revenue meters into the city’s distribution system. The system delivers water for drinking and other uses, Why is the water and and is used for fire protection.

The administration building also houses the places stress on pipes and joints, and can cause significant damage. Flooding at the MWRA’s Chelsea Facility and Chelsea Creek Screen House and Headworks could compromise the structural integrity of the building and put internal operation and control systems at risk. Service interruptions at these facilities would significantly impair regional MWRA operations. MWRA Screen House Vulnerable Infrastructure 5-5MWRA’s central operations and control center, which can be remotely monitored and run via a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The MWRA's Chelsea Creek Screen House and Headworks is located on Marginal Street near the Chelsea Street Bridge. This facility screens and removes grit and controls flows to the four-mile North Metropolitan Relief Tunnel which leads to the Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant. The tributary area to this facility includes 18 communities and 46% of the north system flow to Deer Island (and 30% of total system flow). A SCADA system at this facility also allows for remote operations. Stormwater The stormwater system in Chelsea generally consists of a closed drainage system that collects stormwater at street level, and discharges to bordering waterways via existing outfall structures. The Carter Street pump station also serves to pump storm and ground water collected within a 119 acre catchment area, approximately 80% of which is in Chelsea and the remaining portion is in Everett. Why is the Improvements are currently proposed to the station to stormwater redirect Chelsea’s portion of the stormwater to a new system force main that will discharge to the existing 72-inch gravity drain on Spruce Street. vulnerable?

This has helped to reduce flooding during high systems can fill up and water runoff periods, particularly in low- lying areas in fail, causing flooding the western section of the City. at street level. Future sea level rise and storm surge events will worsen flooding conditions by increasing the volume of water to be handled by the system and blocking the outfall locations. In addition, the Carter Street pump station itself is at risk of flooding. Mace Apartments Green Infrastructure Installation 5-6 Vulnerable InfrastructureAdditionally, the City has partnered with the EPA since 2011 to implement green infrastructure projects. These projects help reduce flooding impacts by decreasing the impervious footprint and encouraging stormwater to be absorbed (infiltrated) into the ground where it lands. Buildings Chelsea’s building infrastructure encompasses a wide range of commercial, residential, industrial, institutional, and governmental buildings within its 1.8 square mile land area. Public buildings include: • Emergency response facilities (Police, Fire, Emergency Management) • Schools, which are also used as emergency shelters • Public works facilities • Public housing • Government administration facilities (MA Information Technology Center, FBI, U.S. Post Office) Fortunately, in Chelsea, none of the City’s Police, Fire or Emergency Management buildings were found to be at risk of coastal flooding under the 2030 and 2070 planning horizons. Why are buildings vulnerable? Some of these buildings are within current Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood hazard areas and the City’s Floodplain Zoning Overlay District, but others are not. As a result, existing flood-proofing may be inadequate making the buildings particularly susceptible to water damage or collapse under future conditions. In addition, sea level rise will result in higher groundwater elevations, which Businesses along Beacham Street (top) and Crescent Avenue could compromise building foundations (bottom) are located within that are not supported on piles. present day flood zones. Vulnerable Infrastructure 5-7Private buildings include: • Single and multi-family residences • Hospitals (Chelsea MGH, Beth Israel Deaconess) • Food processing and distribution facilities (New England Produce Center, Kayem Foods) • Commercial business districts (Mystic Mall) • Industrial operations (Gulf Oil, Global Petroleum, Eastern Minerals) Energy Why is energy infrastructure Energy infrastructure in Chelsea includes facilities for energy vulnerable? production, transmission, storage, Electric and gas lines and distribution including are vulnerable to substations and electric lines, roadway erosion/ natural gas systems, and petroleum products (e.g., washout which gasoline, ethanol, diesel, kerosene, and fuel oil). can cause service Energy infrastructure in Chelsea includes facilities for energy interruptions or production, transmission, storage, and distribution including considerable damage substations and electric lines, natural gas systems, and petroleum products (e.g., gasoline, ethanol, diesel, kerosene, to equipment.

There are two neighborhoods and pressure regulating stations within the mapped coastal flooding probability areas. Chelsea Creek. 5-8 Vulnerable InfrastructureThere are two large tank farms in Chelsea – Gulf Oil upriver of the Chelsea Street Bridge and Global Petroleum, adjacent to the Tobin Bridge. These facilities provide petroleum products to greater Boston and MetroWest areas, as well as southern New Hampshire. The products are shipped by tanker or barge. Earthern berms and/or walls surround the sites, likely for spill containment. Telecommunications Telecommunications infrastructure systems in Chelsea include a combination of above ground and underground systems. Providers include Comcast, Verizon, and Crown Castle International. These providers serve residential, commercial, and institutional customers, including City Hall. The best way to defend against failure scenarios is to build greater capacity and redundancy into systems. However, this is hard to do in a highly competitive commercial market, where efficiency and profit are the key drivers. Why is telecommunication vulnerable? Telecommunication systems are susceptible to failure or destruction due to increased flooding and groundwater levels. These conditions can weaken foundations that support overhead poles and expose underground conduits to increased water and salinity levels. Prolonged inundation could compromise short term and long term system integrity and function, and reduce the overall lifespan of system components (e.g. sheathing and cabling). Recreational Recreational assets in Chelsea include a combination of waterfront and neighborhood parks. Mary O’Malley Waterfront Park, owned and maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, resides along the Mystic River, from the Island End River to the Tobin Bridge. Other existing parks within the mapped risk areas include Island End Park, Polonia Playground, PORT Park, Highland Park, and Chelsea Greenway Shared Use Trail. Also included are playgrounds and fields at the City's schools. Vulnerable Infrastructure 5-9The City also envisions creating a waterfront park at the end of the Chelsea Street Bridge (near the terminus of the Chelsea Shared-Use Path, being constructed along the BRT Silver Line). Public parks are particularly important to the quality of life for residents given the scarcity of open space and density of development. There are also two private marinas – the Admiral’s Hill Marina on the Island End River and Chelsea Yacht Club beneath the Tobin Bridge at the end of PORT Park, Marginal Street Broadway. How are parks vulnerable? Coastal flooding and higher groundwater elevations has the potential to permanently damage hard and natural surfaces at these parks. Likewise, the marinas are at risk of temporary inundation during storms and permanent inundation under future sea level rise projections. 5-10 Vulnerable Infrastructure6 CRITICAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE The next step in the assessment process ranks public Public infrastructure infrastructure assets within the five vulnerability zones based on criticality and the probability of flooding is owned by the public or in present day, 2030, and 2070. This process also is for public use. considered state infrastructure and private utilities that provide critical public services. Starting with the list of Critical Infrastructure in Hazard Areas identified by the City’s Hazard Mitigation Plan (MAPC, 2014), the study team consulted with the City to identify critical public service infrastructure within the 2030 and 2070 BH-FRM probable flood areas. A total of 12 public infrastructure assets are identified as being at risk. • Carter Street Pump Station • Broadway bridge over Mill Creek • City Yard • Chelsea Street bridge over Chelsea Creek • Chelsea High School • Railroad bridge over Mill Creek • Williams Middle School Complex • MWRA Chelsea Creek Headworks and • Burke School Complex Screen House • Meridian Street Bridge over Chelsea Creek • Electric Substation #488 • MWRA Chelsea Facility Critical Public Infrastructure 6-1Calculating Risk There are many different mathematical models that can be used to calculate a risk score to prioritize infrastructure assets/facilities. RISK = For this study, the goal was to use a system that was simple to follow CONSEQUENCE x PROBABILITY and easily communicated. A simple five-tier qualitative rating system (Table 6.1) was developed for determining a consequence score. This score was then multiplied by the probability (likelihood) of flooding under present day, 2030, and 2070 scenarios using the BH-FRM. Because the BH-FRM provides estimated areas of probable flooding, a weighting factor was also applied to the calculation. Assets/facilities within present day flood areas were given higher priority than those at risk in future years. The weighting factor assigns a 60% weight to infrastructure within the present day flood area, 30% to 2030, and 10% to 2070. The assets/facilities can then be ranked from highest to lowest, in order of priority, based on the total score. In other words, the higher the score, the higher the priority to investigate adaptation measures for the infrastructure. Consequence Table 6.1 Consequence Rating How critical is the asset? Public Safety Rating Area of Service Loss Economic Public Health & & Emergency Activities Environment Services 5 Regional Severe Severe Severe 4 City Wide High High High 3 Multiple Areas / Neighborhoods Moderate Moderate Moderate 2 Single Area / Neighborhood Low Low Low 1 Single Property None None None 6-2 Critical Public InfrastructureA consequence of failure score was calculated for each asset/facility. This score was based on adding the individual ratings (1 through 5) for each of the following four criticality criteria: Area of Service Loss: Who is impacted by the loss of or damage to the core functions of the asset? Public Safety & Emergency Services: How important is the asset to community evacuation and disaster response operations? Social & Economic Activities: How important is the asset to providing people with access or service to their homes and jobs? Public Health & Environment: How important is the asset to controlling human exposure to pollutants and secondary impacts to the natural environment? In addition to the above criteria, the Service Loss Duration was also considered. However, the City regards an asset that is out of service for more than one day as Severe and therefore this item was not given a consequence rating score as it would have been the same for all 12 assets. Table 6.2 below provides an example of how a facility may be rated and scored. Table 6.2 Example Criticality Rating: Carter Street Pump Station Rating Criteria Justification 119-acre catchment area in Chelsea 5 Area of Service Loss and Everett 5 Public Safety & Emergency Service Impacts major evacuation routes Loss of access to local commercial 4 Social & Economic Activities areas Controls human exposure to surface 4 Public Health & Environment contaminants 18 Total Consequence of Failure Score It is recognized that there is a certain level of interpretation or subjectivity applied when assigning consequence ratings. Appendix F includes the scoring guidance used for this study. Probability The likelihood of flooding under present day, 2030, and 2070 scenarios is based on data developed using the BH-FRM. A geographic data point for each public infrastructure asset was located in the BH-FRM. Based on a critical elevation at each location, an estimated depth of flooding was determined where the flood event has the probability to equal or exceed this depth in any given year (a 0.1 to 100% chance). In some cases, any depth of water would put a location at risk, whereas other locations can sustain core functions even with a few inches of water. The possibility that the water depth starts to impair an asset's core functions is calculated into the score. A detailed table of this data for each asset is included in Appendix G (Probability of Exceedance Curve Data).

Ownership: The majority of critical public infrastructure assets are not within the direct control of the City. In fact only, five of the twelve assets are owned by the City. This fact emphasizes the importance of engaging the other public service providers in the resiliency planning conversation. 2. Vulnerability Zones: The twelve critical public infrastructure assets are distributed relatively evenly among four vulnerability zones, with no assets in the Mystic River Zone. Four of the five City owned assets are within the Island End River Vulnerability Zone. 3. Total Risk Score: The public infrastructure assets that are most critical to the region are also most at risk of coastal flooding under the three planning horizons. As a result, these assets are ranked at the top of the priority list. Critical Public Infrastructure 6-5This page intentionally blank 6-6 Critical Public Infrastructure7 ADAPTATION MEASURES Identifying appropriate adaption measures to protect Chelsea from the effects of sea level rise and coastal storm surge could seem like an overwhelming task: Where do we start? What probability of flooding are we willing to accept? To what elevation should we design? How much will this cost? The first step is to realize that these measures will need Adapt: to be implemented over time with the help of public and private partners. The City does not need to do this To adjust or modify alone, or all at once. The key is to advance measures something to a particular at all scales, in a coordinated manner, to address coastal situation or circumstance flooding risks in the short term and long term. The second step is to realize that no adaptation measure is a fail-safe solution as no amount of modeling or planning can fully predict the future. This is an important reality that focuses our attention on identifying measures that provide public benefits in the near term and are flexible enough to work over a range of future conditions. Public benefits can include improved public access to the waterfront, and protection and enhancement of ecosystems, for example. Flexible approaches include berms or walls that can be adjusted vertically in height, or ecological installations that grow with sea level rise. Clever adaptation measures that incorporate such elements are more likely to gain the community and financial support needed for implementation. Adaptation Strategies 7-1For the purposes of this assessment, three different scales of climate change adaptation measures were considered: 1. Site specific measures that protect a single property 2. Shoreline measures that protect multiple properties 3. Policy- or regulation-based measures to provide city-wide protection standards Paired measures can offer the greatest level of protection. For example, a site-specific measure may function as a second line of defense to an area-wide focused shoreline measure. Policy or regulation-based measures are more far reaching and can guide or require coastal flooding adaptation elements as part of new construction or redevelopment projects. Site Specific Measures The decision to focus on public infrastructure is driven by the desire to provide the City with some adaptation measures that are within their own control and can be implemented in the near term. Therefore, the site specific measures below are focused on City-owned facilities identified through the prioritization process outlined in Chapter 6. This focus on City-owned facilities does not discount the importance of understanding how other public service providers are modifying their facilities to coastal flooding. Seven of the twelve identified critical public infrastructure assets are not within the direct control of the City. These seven facilities are owned by the MWRA, MBTA (MassDOT Rail and Transit Division), MassDOT Highway Division, and Eversource. Each of these entities is at varying stages of assessing the vulnerability of their infrastructure to climate change. The MWRA has flood preparedness plans in place and has already identified building envelope retrofits needed to protect their Chelsea facilities from coastal flooding. They also have remote and/or redundant operation and control capabilities for their facilities. The MBTA has started implementing site specific adaptation measures at other facilities and will be further considering climate change impacts as part of their Focus40 planning effort, the agency’s long range capital investment plan for the next 25 years. The MBTA is about to embark on a system-wide vulnerability assessment which will likely evaluate the MBTA railroad and bus corridors in Chelsea in more detail. MassDOT Highway Division has extensively studied the vulnerability of the Central Artery system and is looking to expand these efforts statewide. Eversource is in the process of assessing flood protection measures at their substation facilities. Any proposed flood-resilient improvements to the Chelsea facility would be done as part of a project separate from the Mystic - East Eagle - Chelsea Reliability Project. All of these providers are thinking about climate change, which should open the door for follow-up discussions about community-level resilience planning and future implementation phasing. 7-2 Adaptation StrategiesThe evaluation of site specific measures incorporates the research performed by Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) students and faculty advisors in conjunction with the City and MIT Sea Grant program. The result of their work is a report entitled Creation of Flood Risk Adaptation Measures for Critical Public Facilities in Chelsea, Design Parameters for Massachusetts, October 2015. Adaptation Measures The student’s research has proven to be a valuable resource for this study. For the purposes of this assessment, the proposed adaptation elevation above sea level is assumed to be 12 feet in 2030 and 15 feet in 2070. This translates to three to five foot tall installations. The elevations are based on the 0.1% exceedance probability shown in Appendix G, plus an In order to determine the elevation of adaptation measures approximate one foot of freeboard above considered for this assessment, the projected flood elevation in the Boston the following baseline data was Harbor Flood Risk Model (BH-FRM). utilized: 1. Existing ground elevations were estimated from MassGIS LiDAR data (from 2013-2014). 2. Elevations were estimated for present and future tide1, and flooding2 (see Table 7.1). Although not the focus of this assessment, consideration will also need to be given to how increased groundwater levels as a result of sea level rise could compromise the stability of building foundations, paved areas, and surrounding lands. In certain circumstances, high water tables may negatively impact a facility before coastal flooding, as a result of storm surge, is projected to occur.

The small structure houses three pumps approximately 25-feet underground that transmit storm and groundwater out of a 119 acre catchment area of Chelsea and Everett. Of this 119 acre catchment area, approximately 80% is in Chelsea. The pump station operates daily transmitting flows from this catchment area via a 30-inch force main to the Market Street culvert at the Island End River. The pump station is currently being redesigned to redirect flows from the catchment area to a new force main that will discharge to an existing 72-inch gravity drain on Spruce Street. The Market Street culvert will continue to receive flows from other portions of Everett. The approximate ground elevation at the pump station building is 5.5 feet above sea level (MassGIS LiDAR data from 2013-2014) and the pump station top slab elevation is 7.43 feet(Weston & Sampson). The 7.43 foot elevation represents the critical elevation at which floodwaters could begin to impact pump station operations. As shown in the probability of exceedance tables in Appendix H, there is a 0.1 to 2% probability, or likelihood, that coastal flood waters will overtop this slab in 2030, and 30% probability in 2070. To protect and maintain the functionality of the station under these future conditions, a number of adaptation measures are recommended inside and outside of the existing pump station building envelope. Carter Street Pump Station (photo by Stantec, April 13, 2016) 7-4 Adaptation StrategiesThe City has indicated their preference to construct a permanent wall around the pump station as the primary means of protecting the facility from coastal flooding. A permanent wall would enable City personnel to focus their storm preparation efforts on other critical tasks rather than spending valuable time erecting a temporary barrier. The wall will need to allow for scalable access by City personnel, such as through removable entranceways or ladder/stairs, and be designed to withstand the hydrostatic pressures of the floodwaters. The wall should have a top line elevation of 12 feet NAVD88 with design provisions to allow the wall to be heightened an additional 3 feet if future conditions warrant. A top of wall elevation of 12 feet NAVD88 correlates to a 6.5-foot wall from ground level (or a 4.5-foot wall above slab elevation). Other building envelope and equipment retrofits and/or relocations would provide secondary means of protection for the station. Recommendations include: • Install flood logs at doorways • Raise electrical and HVAC equipment • Raise or protect generator and fuel oil storage tank • Repoint/waterproof exterior masonry • Install watertight access hatches • Install a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) to provide remote control operation of major systems The cost of the perimeter wall and recommended building envelope and equipment retrofits and/ or relocations is estimated to be in the range of $500,000, up to $750,000 for programming purposes. A structural evaluation of the pump station building is also required to determine if additional structural reinforcement is required to withstand the hydrostatic pressures of the floodwaters. Example of a permanent perimeter wall (Stantec, Santa Barbara, CA - top) and flood logs (Flood Control International - bottom) Adaptation Strategies 7-5Schools There are three public schools within the mapped flood risk probability area: Chelsea High School, Williams Middle School Complex, and Burke Elementary School Complex. In addition to serving the student community, each of these schools is used as an emergency shelter. The City expects the buildings will exceed a 50 year life span in the absence of a significant hazard event. • Chelsea High School: This school is located at 299 Everett Avenue, adjacent to Route 16, and serves the Grade 9-12 student community. The main building opened in September 1996 and a 500 student addition was built in 2002. • Williams Middle School Complex: This complex is located at 180 Walnut Street, just north of Route 1. This school complex includes 2 middle schools for Grades 5-8. These schools include the Joseph A. Browne School and the Wright Science and Technology Academy. This complex also opened in 1996. • Burke Elementary School Complex: This complex is located at 300 Crescent Street adjacent to Eastern Avenue and the MBTA railroad corridor. This school complex includes four elementary schools Chelsea High School & Burke Elementary School for Grades 1-4. These schools include the Complex (Google StreetView) William A. Berkowitz, Edgar F. Hooks, George F. Kelly, and Frank M. Sokolowski Elementary Schools. The Burke Complex opened in September 1996. The structural elements comprising the buildings’ foundations are assumed to be piles, grade beams and slabs based on available record plans. Typically, in a system of this kind, the grade beams are positively connected to the piles and the slabs are structural, spanning between and positively connected to the grade beams. The approximate ground elevation at the schools range from 6 to 10 feet above sea level (MassGIS LiDAR data from 2002-2014). And it is assumed that the critical elevation is within 6 inches (1 step) of the elevation. As shown in the Probability of Exceedance Tables in Appendix H, there is a 0.1 to 2% chance that coastal flood waters could overtop this slab in 2030, and 30% chance in 2070. In order to protect the schools from flood damage during their anticipated life span, exterior retrofits could include: • Modify window openings and reducing size • Install flood logs at the exterior doors and adjacent storefront glazing • Repoint/waterproof exterior masonry 7-6 Adaptation StrategiesUnlike the pump station, the schools will not need to be operational during a coastal flood event unless they are intended to still function as emergency shelters. As an emergency shelter, not only would these buildings need to be flood resistant, but also allow people, goods and services in and out during the flood event. Accordingly, under coastal flood conditions, the building would require the addition of doors above the 3 foot line with portable ramps on the inside of the building. The assumption is, with the site under water, people, goods and services would come and go by boat. A better solution would seem to be to discontinue use of these buildings as emergency shelters. Instead, the City could make arrangments with neighboring towns having higher elevations, such as Everett, and one or more of their buildings could be designated to be Chelsea’s emergency shelters in the event of a flood. This would eliminate the need for difficult and costly modifications. City Yard The Department of Public Works (DPW) City Yard is located at 280 Beacham Street. The facility includes a larger hanger-style space where public maintenance vehicles and equipment are stored and serviced. There are also on-site offices for DPW and the water and sewer maintenance and operation staff. Road salt, excavated materials and street sweeper deposits are stored along the exterior perimeter of the property. Given the age and condition of the City Yard building and the City’s desire to eventually relocate DPW operations to a new location, no permanent measures are proposed at this location. Consideration could be given to two temporary adaptation solutions: 1. Temporarily relocating equipment prior to and during flood events to enable emergency response and cleanup operations. 2. Purchasing a deployable (portable) flood mitigation system. Deployable perimeter installations include paneling systems such as Aquafence or water inflated flood barriers such as Tiger Dams. Massport has purchased the Aquafence system for use at their critical facilities at Logan Airport such as the State Police Building. The cost for a 4 foot high installation is approximately $350 per linear foot based on the Massport example. The systems break down into roughly 5-foot by 5-foot crates. These installations need to be used in conjunction with a sump pump and stairs system to keep the interior dry during storm events and maintain access. The concern with these systems, especially in an urban setting, is the need to store the materials when not in use and routinely test the setups to verify they are still operational. Aquafence Installation in Mount City Yard Storage Facility Vernon, WA Adaptation Strategies 7-7Shoreline Measures Recalling the discussion on flood pathways in Chapter 4, the Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model presents low-elevation locations where water is anticipated to enter the City (Figure 4.1). In response to this information, this section presents adaptation measures focused at the shoreline that could reduce the probability of coastal flooding. These shoreline adaptation measures will require significantly more time and effort to finance, design, permit, and construct than the site-specific measures presented above. The measures can range from 1,500 to 3,200 linear feet of shoreline and involve a combination of public and private properties. To make installations like this possible, it is crucial to open communication between the City, property owners, community, and regulatory agencies early in the planning process to gain support, develop partnerships, secure funding, and set realistic project timelines. What types of installations are recommended? Where feasible, natural systems and processes should be employed to help protect the City from coastal flooding and provide ecological benefits. The potential for “green infrastructure” installations exist where large areas of tidal flats or salt marsh line the shore. However, in many locations, industrial development and state regulations limit this type of installation and therefore engineered barriers should be utilized. Here, more traditional \"gray infrastructure\" is appropriate. Some locations may benefit from a hybrid of green and gray Living Shoreline infrastructure to provide protection for a wider range of potential flood depths. Coastal wetland plantings and berms can be designed to manage low to medium tidal flooding, where engineered walls could be provided for additional storm surge protection (NOAA, 2015). In any case, some shoreline installations can also provide an opportunity to benefit the surrounding community, including improved public access to the waterfront and enriching an area's visual character. Future design of these installations must keep in mind that the Mystic River and majority of Chelsea Creek are within a Designated Port Area (DPA). The water-dependent industrial properties in the DPA are regulated by the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and must maintain access to maritime transportation (among other specific regulatory requirements). This 7-8 Adaptation Strategiesmeans that adaptation measure installations must not preclude future water dependent development opportunities. Depending on the site, this could mean that any vertical walls may need to be set back from the waterfront. In many locations, a deployable barrier (as discussed under Site Specific Measures) may be appropriate.

(ASLA) Adaptation Strategies 7-9Gray Infrastructure Throughout Chelsea’s industrial waterfront areas, there is less opportunity to create the green infrastructure systems needed to reduce the impacts of future sea level rise and storm surges. Here, engineered barriers such as bulkheads and sea walls could help reduce the probability of coastal flooding. One benefit to constructing these steel and/or concrete structures is that they can be vertically extended over time. This would allow wall height to be increased in phases as data regarding future impacts from sea level rise and storm surges is refined. In some situations, a concrete cap or wall may benefit from aesthetic details, to soften the Bulkhead with railing, Charleston, SC visual impact. Concrete form liners can be designed with patterns to create an artistic statement and/or announce a particular place or neighborhood. Another way to break up a large wall could be to let community artists or schools paint murals, or designate an approved graffiti location to provide a creative platform for the city’s youth. What can be built at each location? Based on existing shoreline features, potential adaptation measures have been identified for each Vulnerability Zone described in Chapter 4. Table Sea Wall, UK (photo by Nick Rice, FGW 'Double act' 7.2 provides an overview of where https://www.flickr.com/photos/capuchinoking/) opportunities for green, gray, and hybrid infrastructure are explored. 7-10 Adaptation StrategiesAdditional Considerations These adaptation measures must be permitted under public laws protecting natural, cultural and recreational resources along the shoreline. This includes requirements set by the: • Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA), M.G.L. c. 30, §61-62H • Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (WPA), M.G.L. c.131, §40 • Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1341 et seq., §401 / Massachusetts Clean Water Act, M.G.L. c. 21, §26-53 • Public Waterfront Act, M.G.L. c. 91 • National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), • Federal Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. §1451 et seq./ Massachusetts Coastal Zone Management Act, M.G.L. c. 21A, §2, 4 • Federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. c. 1344 §404 et seq. / Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. c.403 §10 A more in depth discussion of the local, state and federal permits/approvals associated with the above laws can be reviewed in Appendix I. It should be noted that although living shorelines have been constructed in the in states south of New England, there are not many in Massachusetts. The WPA Regulations were recently revised to include special provisions for ecological restoration projects, however there is not yet a specific option regarding the creation of living shorelines.

Today, Bass Creek is encased by a culvert about 500 feet upstream from Chelsea Creek, and the former tidelands are home to a busy industrial area. Low elevations along the shoreline still provide potential flood pathways into this vulnerable zone, threatening approximately 10% of Chelsea's land area. This includes the MWRA Chelsea Facility and Elementary School Complex on Eastern Avenue.

Designing Coastal Community Infrastructure for Climate Change | Chelsea, MassachusettsM i l l C r e e k V u l n e r a b i l i t y Z o n e Area Review Mill Creek has the most natural shoreline of Chelsea's four waterways, edged with tidal flats and salt marsh. Much of these wetlands end abruptly, however, with steep lawns, retaining walls, or stone revetment separating adjacent development. The decks of the Broadway Bridge and MBTA Railroad Bridge over Mill Creek sit just above the projected 2030 flood elevation. Furthermore, the bridge openings could make draining the floodwaters of a coastal superstorm difficult. There are currently no known plans to repair or replace the existing railroad bridge and the Broadway bridge was reconstructed in the 1990s.

The model will study the forces at play along the creek, related to predicted storm surge, sea level rise, and stormwater runoff from the surrounding watershed. Study results should more accurately identify the probability of the bridges being overtopped. Once this information is obtained, adaptation measures can be identified for this zone.

The decision as to which approach should be applied, and what role the City should play, is one that can only be taken at the policy level, and with the input of City board, commissions, and residents. The City’s Floodplain Overlay District encapsulates a portion of the flood pathways identified in this study, adhering to the boundaries of the 2016 FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps. Areas outside of the FEMA FIRM catchment area are not subject to the Flood Plain Overlay District. The City should explore embarking on a zoning study to assess regulatory modifications that facilitate retrofits of existing buildings and ensure new development proceeds safely and is constructed consciously in potential flood pathways. Such a study should approach the topic holistically while addressing building and site design vulnerabilities. Land use regulation is promulgated by M.G.L. Chapter 40 and overseen by the City’s Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) and Planning Board. These entities are tasked with reviewing development proposals for zoning conformance in the event that an applicant requires dimensional relief or accommodation for use. The determination of a development or renovation proposal’s compliance with M.G.L. Ch. 131 Section 40, the Wetlands Protection Act, is made by the City’s Conservation Commission. It is recommended that the City craft a resiliency review check-list for each of the boards and commissions. Addressing the probability of flooding, rising temperatures, and more volatile storm events, this checklist should encourage proper site, building, and landscape design. It should aim to effectuate the adoption of more in-depth resiliency measures by property owners/ developers while pragmatically contemplating the economic variables involved in the real estate market. Particularly, how to urge the adoption of measures by smaller property owners should be assessed, as many may not be able to absorb the net cost. Additionally, the ability of buildings and land to withstand, endure, and recover from severe weather events and flooding should also be explored in the crafting of a check-list. Existing examples of materials for boards & commissions are available from the Boston Conservation Commission, Urban Land Institute, the American Planning Association, and other entities. Structural resilience can be undermined if the appropriate building codes are not followed, which stipulate the bare minimum for safe, inhabitable, and functional buildings. Chelsea City Council adopted the Stretch Energy Building Code in 2016; a part-time Energy Coordinator staff position was also filled to advance the City’s energy agenda and initiatives. Aimed at designing for energy conservation and reducing emissions, the Stretch Energy Code is an effective policy tool. Beyond the “floor” provided by the building code, the City is recommended to investigate and adopt a series of best policy practices for fostering sound design, construction, retrofits, and maintenance of structures situated in flood-risk areas. Moreover, site and landscape design should also be included. This can be done collaboratively through the City’s Department of Planning and Development, the City’s Energy Planner, the MAPC, and related organizations active in sustainable design and construction. 7-34 Adaptation StrategiesThrough policy and planning, the City can encourage the creation of scalable site-specific adaptation plans for regionally significant facilities. Publicly, resilience plans should be considered for the City’s schools. Recreation area design should also respond to the risks characterized in this study. Moreover, with the City embarking on an update of its Open Space and Recreation Plan in 2017, climate adaptation and mitigation measures should be analyzed for use in varying types of parks and open space. For private industry and commerce, tailored site solutions could be pursued, in conjunction with the property’s owners, tenants, and stakeholders. For example, a study of the New England Produce Terminal’s vulnerability to climate change was conducted concurrent to this effort. Undertaken by the MAPC, American Geophysical Union, UMass Boston, and City of Chelsea, this constellation of organizations reflect the collaborative make-up that the City could choose to employ. Similar studies could be conducted for other industrial clusters vital to the regional economic, or posing a hazard to the City in a severe weather event. Overall, conceptualization and resulting activities should materialize as public-private partnerships and vanquish any cultural or educational barriers that may be present. In 2017, the City will embark on a Municipal Harbor Plan with the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management. Encompassing the Designated Port Area, this plan will chart the maritime future of Chelsea’s waterfront, accounting for projected economic, demographic, and climactic factors. Resilience should be an the underlying element present throughout this study. Specifically, design propositions in this study, which would need to comprehensively accommodate M.G.L. Ch. 91 regulations and access, could be incorporated into discussions about port infrastructure. Adaptation Strategies 7-358 NEXT STEPS This assessment identified vulnerable areas of the City at risk of coastal flooding, prioritized public infrastructure in these areas, and recommended site, shoreline, and policy based adaptation measures. Following this assessment, additional efforts are needed to: Assess valued socioeconomic components in the five vulnerability zones The assessment should be broadened to include consideration of where residents live and work and their continued ability to maintain a high quality of life when these social and economic components of the built environment are at risk of coastal flooding under present day, 2030 and 2070 conditions. Valued socio-economic components include, but are not limited to: • Environmental Justice (EJ) neighborhoods • Number of residential units • Major employers, health care providers, and supermarkets In order to accomplish this goal, the population of these zones need to understand the topic of vulnerability and adaptation planning, and what it means to their daily life. Communicate the topic of vulnerability and adaptation to a wider audience A more robust public outreach and education process is needed to educate the public about climate change related vulnerability in their neighborhoods, the places they work, and the city in general. Creating this level of informed involvement will require peer to peer engagement at the neighborhood level, adaptation training for City staff/boards/ commissions, and the formation of working groups focused around each vulnerability Next Steps 8-1zone. Working group membership could include City Council members, non-profits, neighborhood groups, major employers/property owners, and public agencies with a vested interest in the specific vulnerability zone. With wider public understanding of these issues, the expectation is that residents, agencies, businesses, and property owners will become invested in the resiliency planning effort. Conduct supplemental modeling of key flood pathways Two supplemental hydrodynamic modeling efforts are recommended to better assess the probability of coastal flooding and support the public outreach and education process. First, street level analysis of the flood pathways in each of the vulnerability zones will allow for a better understanding of where coastal flooding will be concentrated and illustrate the value of action (or inaction). The street level analysis will also allow for further refinement of the adaptation measures developed to date. Second, a hydraulic study along Mill Creek, particularly in relation to the bridges crossing over the creek, is needed to assess future flooding and determine appropriate adaptation measures. Form public/private partnerships These next steps will highlight opportunities for the public, private, and non-profit entities in the City and neighboring municipalities to act together to improve community resilience for their mutual benefit. It is also hoped that these discussions will lead to the formation of public/private partnerships and cost sharing around agreed upon adaptation strategies and heighten the need to modify City ordinances and other policies to limit the vulnerability of future development. Again, no one single entity can do this alone, or all at once. Seek potential funding Funding is needed to design, permit, and construct the site specific and shoreline adaptation measures discussed in Chapter 7. In addition, some of the shoreline measures require land acquisition which will add to the overall project cost. The site specific measures can likely be funded through the City’s Capital Improvements Program and/or maintenance budgets. However, each of the shoreline measures requires a significant level of investment which cannot be independently borne by the City. In these locations, the City should seek to leverage City and private funds (corporations, foundations, non-profits) with a combination of state and federal funding grant funding from sources such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EOEAA). Consideration should also be given to phasing each project to spread out the overall project costs and allow for adequate time to secure the required environmental approvals. Creative funding and implementation strategies are needed to successfully advance the concept designs towards implementation. These additional efforts should be advanced in parallel in the near term recognizing that year 2030 is just over a decade away. Again, the City does not need to do this alone. The formation of strategic partnerships and engagement of local champions is critical to advancing the City’s resiliency agenda and address coastal flooding risks in the short term and long term. 8-2 Next StepsAppendix A Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations Terms Adjustment or modification to a particular situation or Adaptation circumstance Crucial path that provides petroleum products (gasoline, diesel Critical Energy Pathway fuel, heating oil, jet fuel) to a region Deployable (portable) Paneling systems such as Aquafence or water inflated flood perimeter installations barriers Fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless or race, color, national origin, or income with respect Environmental Justice to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies Ecological systems and processes harnessed by humans to combat climate change, create healthy built environments, Green Infrastructure and to improve quality of life.

One of the impacts of climate change is that coastal flooding risks are also likely to increase. Although there are various options for modeling sea level rise and storm surge, the most accurate approach for assessing combined storm surge risk and sea level rise conditions is through the imple- mentation of hydrodynamic models that include the physical processes that are associated with storm climatology and propagation. The probabilistic model approach developed by Woods Hole Group is a comprehensive flood risk model that can accurately assess flooding risk under present day and future climate change conditions. The probabilistic modeling system is comprised of the Advanced CIRCulation model (ADCIRC), a two-dimensional, depth-integrated, long wave, hydrodynamic mod- el for coastal areas, inlets, rivers and floodplains that in this application is used to predict storm surge flooding, and the unstructured grid version of Simulating Waves Nearshore model (UNSWAN), a wave generation and transformation model. The ADCIRC model is tightly coupled with UNSWAN, dynamically exchanging physical processes information during each time step, to provide an complete and accurate representation of water surface elevations, winds, waves, and flooding along the coastline and upland areas. For example, the probabilistic model includes important physical processes such as wave setup, wind stresses, and wave-current interaction such that these processes are included in the flooding dynamics of the coastline. This model has been successfully applied and used in Boston, MA and the Boston Harbor Area for assessing potential vulnerabilities in the Central Artery tunnel system. The model, called the Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model (BH-FRM) is the model that is being used to provide the results for the City of Chelsea. Full details on the model can be obtained from the report (https://www.massdot.state.ma.us/highway/Departments/EnvironmentalServices/ EMSSustainabilityUnit/Sustainability.aspx). The model is currently being extended to the entire coastline of Massachusetts. Numerous communities are applying the probabilistic model results to as- sess vulnerabilities and design adaptations. The model is also regularly being used to prioritize climate change adaptations and engineering designs such that communities can direct funding to the most critical areas of need first without being encumbered by financial constraints to fix everything at once. If applied, the model results can be used to assess the vulnerability and risk of coastal flooding for Chelsea infrastructure and natural resources, as well as provide design condition inputs and adaptation and resiliency options for the Town. The probabilistic modeling approach simulates a statistically robust set of storms (both tropical and extra-tropical) for each climate change and/or Sea Level Rise (SLR) scenario through a Monte Carlo statistical approach (Figure 1). Results of the Monte Carlo simulations are used to generate Cumu- lative Probability Distribution Functions (CDFs) of the storm surge water levels at a high degree of spatial precision. In particular, an accurate and precise assessment of the exceedence probability of Appendix A-15combined SLR and storm surge, provided at high spatial resolution help decision makers identify areas of existing vulnerability requiring immediate action, as well as, areas that benefit from present plan- ning for future preparedness. Results of the Monte Carlo approach also produce a statistically robust, spatially variable map of risk for each given SLR scenario that can be used to determine the potential need for adaptation, and the timing for potential adaptation, at each facility and for each infrastructure asset. Specific adaptations can also be provided to the model (both gray and green designs) and the model can be re-simulated with these adaptations or solutions in place. As such, the model can be used to predict the effectiveness of various resiliency options and the influence the adaptations have on the nature, extent, and depth of flooding probabilities. The model results also can be, and have been, tied directly to economic models that assess the cost implications of future climate changes and associated adaptation options. Figure 1. Tropical Storm tracks simulated through the probabilistic model. A-16 AppendixAppendix E Chelsea Natural Resource Evolution Summary These results are part of the Statewide Modeling the Effects of Sea Level Rise on Coastal Wetlands for Massachusetts Coastal Zone Management. (ENV 14 CZM 08 in publication, 2016). Background: Climate change, with increased storm intensity, changes in precipitation patterns, and global sea- level rise will exacerbate already difficult coastal management issues related to both infrastructure and natural resources (Bosma et al., 2015). Recent studies have identified sea-level rise as one of the most certain and potentially destructive impacts of climate change (Meehl et al., 2007). Coastal wetlands are among the most susceptible ecosystems to climate change, especially accelerated sea-level rise. Nicholls et al. (2009) points out that coastal wetlands, including salt marshes and intertidal areas, could experience substantial area losses due to sea-level rise. Because coastal wetlands are extremely productive ecosystems, and provide a variety of ecosystem services, such as flood protection, waste assimilation, nursery areas for fisheries, and conservation and recreation benefits, such loss would have a high human cost. Recognizing the threats posed by climate change and sea-level rise, the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) desired to assess and analyze the effects of sea-level rise on coastal wetlands for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (ENV 14 CZM 08 in publication, 2016). The project’s intent was to simulate the effects of sea-level rise using an ecological model and implement the model at its highest level of complexity. The model selected to evaluate the impact of sea level rise on coastal resources was the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM), originally developed with EPA funding in the 1980s. The SLAMM model attempts to capture the major coastal processes, at least at a rudimentary level, involved in wetland conversions and shoreline modifications expected to occur over a long term. The results of the marsh migration modeling are intended to be used for future coastal planning in a number of ways. For instance, model results from this project can be used to identify areas with barriers to landward migration of salt marshes. These results can therefore serve as a guide for development and implementation of adaptation strategies for coastal managers and policymakers to proactively address potential impacts from long-term sea-level rise. The results produced for the City of Chelsea have been extracted from the larger CZM Commonwealth of Massachusetts project for this particular study. Appendix A-17Input Data: High resolution elevation data may be the most important Sea Level Affecting Marsh Migration (SLAMM) model data requirement, since the elevation data demarcate not only where salt penetration is expected, but also the frequency of inundation for wetlands and marshes when combined with tidal range data. Input elevation data also helps define the lower elevation range for beaches, wetlands and tidal flats, which dictates when they should be converted to a different land-cover type or open water due to an increased frequency of inundation. For this project, LiDAR was acquired from MassGIS. The majority of the state was covered with the 2011 USGS LiDAR for the Northeast project, and this covers the Hull area. In order to reduce processing time within the SLAMM model, areas of higher elevation within each regional panel that are unlikely to be affected by coastal processes, such as sea level rise, were excluded prior to processing; all areas above an elevation of 60 feet (NAVD88) were clipped from the input files. Wetland Classification Information: The 2011 wetland layer developed by the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) is used as the baseline source for the wetlands input file for marsh migration modeling. Utilizing the NWI data had two key benefits over the 1990s MassDEP wetland layer. First, the NWI data not only provided a more recent dataset, but also more closely temporally matches that of the LiDAR datasets. The second benefit to utilizing the NWI data is that it streamlined the conversion between source wetland categories and Sea Level Affecting Marsh Migration (SLAMM) model wetland codes. The documentation provided with the SLAMM software contains a key to convert each NWI classification to the wetland classification system used by SLAMM. A summary of this conversion key is present in Table 1. Sea Level Rise Projections: The Sea Level Rise (SLR) projections are consistent with those used in the BH-FRM modeling to produce the inundation proba maps. As such, there SLR used in the marsh migration modeling is consistent with the values used it the flood risk modeling for the City of Chelsea. Additional Data Input: Additional model input includes, but is not limited to, accretion rates (marsh, beach, etc.), erosion rates, tidal range and attenuation, freshwater parameters, dikes and dams, and impervious surfaces. For complete details, see the Statewide Modeling: the Effects of Sea Level Rise on Coastal Wetlands for Massachusetts Coastal Zone Management. (ENV 14 CZM 08 in publication, 2016).

Allowing the SLAMM model to utilize the impervious layer would “protect” developed upland areas (i.e. impervious areas would not be allowed to convert to other land cover types); however, this approach would have prohibited marshes and wetlands from expanding into currently “developed” areas. While in reality this may likely happen (marsh migration would halt at the impervious boundary), this approach to the modeling does not inform stakeholders where the marsh may desire to migrate Appendix A-19given the elevation landscape if the impervious features were absent. Since one of the project goals was to determine how and where the marsh may want to migrate in response to sea-level rise, it was desired to determine what system were susceptible to ecological losses due to inability to adjust to the changing climate both independent of the impervious landscape and with it in place. As such, the SLAMM model simulations were run without the impervious layers (to show where natural resources would like to migrate in absence of anthropogenic influences) and subsequently the impervious layer was also overlain on the results to indicate where areas may likely not be subject to natural resource migration due to the built environment. In Chelsea, which is predominantly developed, the impervious overlay illustrates the limited areas that are available for natural resource migration. Figures 1 through 3 show the wetland classification areas for 2011, 2030, and 2070 timeframes, respectively, for the City of Chelsea. Figures present maps with no impervious overlay (left hand panel in each figure) and with impervious overlay (right hand panel in each figure). Figure 1 presents the current conditions, as defined by the NWI. Subsequently, Figure 2 shows the change in wetland classification locations projected to 2030, impacted by SLR. Similarly, Figure 3 shows the change in wetland classification locations projected to 2070, impacted by SLR. City Wide: Although the SLAMM results project some minor wetland expansion and loss of upland area in 2030, and significantly more in 2070 (based on the left hand panels), a vast majority of these areas occur within developed and residential neighborhoods (based on the right hand panels). However, due to the high density of development and impervious surface in Chelsea is it unlikely that the majority of these areas will be allowed to transition to wetland. However, these developed areas will likely experience higher water tables, increased salt water intrusion, day to day nuisance flooding, and higher frequency of storm flooding. Therefore, these areas will likely need additional protection in the future under normal tidal conditions sea level rise conditions (no storms). For example, by 2070 (Figure 3), the SLAMM model projects that the industrial and residential areas near the Gulf Oil terminal east of Chelsea Creek will begin to transition to water levels that would support irregularly flooded marsh and transitional scrub-shrub wetland. Similarly, by 2070 (Figure 3), the model suggests that Willow St. and Highland Park area will experience more regular nuisance flooding creating a transitional scrub-shrub wetland (absent impervious area. There are, however, a few undeveloped or less developed areas within Chelsea that will likely experience significant changes in land cover and wetland type and may offer opportunities for natural resource management and/or expansion due to the changing climate. These areas include: • The Mill Creek corridor, • The area around the Island End River • The Chelsea Creek region just north of the Gulf Oil terminal and near Merritt Park The Mill Creek Corridor: • In the relative near term (between 2011 and 2030), there are minimal changes to the Mill Creek wetlands, which primarily consists of open water, irregularly flooded marsh, and fresh marsh resources. At the head of the creek, there are some minor changes by 2030 as salt laden water is able to further penetrate upstream in the system. Inland fresh wetlands A-20 Appendixbegin to transition to irregularly flooded marsh areas and transitional scrub shrub areas. By 2070, a majority of the creek system has transitioned to regularly flooded marsh and estuarine open water. • No immediate adaptations are required for this area in terms of natural resources as the Mill Creek corridor can be allowed to advance naturally for normal tidal conditions; however, in the long-term, and during storm events, more frequent overbank flooding can be expected to surrounding properties and the fringe marsh areas may be expected to expand. Smaller proactive restoration measures could be considered along the Mill Creek shorelines to protect infrastructure residing along the creek banks as well as to provide natural resource expansion and protection. Potential options could consider living shoreline applications and targeted thin layer deposition projects that would involve the placement of clean, compatible sediment in thin layers on the existing salt marsh to assist the elevations in keeping up with the rising tidal increases. Island End River: • The Island End River, which historically extended further to the north-northwest in Chelsea, is primarily open water with some limited salt marsh resources located at the head of the system. By 2030, minor expansion of the salt marsh areas is expected, including development of fringe marsh along the eastern bank of Island End River. By 2070, the salt marsh resources would migrate and expand to the north; however, much of this area is currently developed and would be faced with normal tidal nuisance flooding on a daily basis. • Due to the overall vulnerability of this area to storm surge, the relatively focused pathway for flooding, and, in the long-term, daily flooding, adaptations should be considered that focus on protecting upland areas while also enhancing natural resources. Hybrid solutions consisting of green infrastructure that expands valuable and protective marsh resources via a living shoreline solution coupled with secondary defense components of natural berms is one potential option that serves to provide green resiliency. Efforts could also be made with expanding the public interaction with the water through integrated, elevated walkways and water access as part of a berm system. An outfall forebay to treat stormwater runoff, if the current outfall is left in place, could also be integrated into the overall hybrid design along the shoreline. This green resiliency option could extend and connect to the Mary O’Malley Waterfront Park to enhance both the wetland resources and the future recreational space. The Chelsea Creek region north of the Gulf Oil terminal: This area shows little change between 2011 and 2030. By 2070 there is normal tidal flooding that is expected throughout the Eastern Avenue area. While there isn’t significant wetland re- sources in the area, due to the highly developed nature of this region (and the significant imper- vious area), there is an opportunity to expand wetland resources in this area, while also providing resilience and protection to upland infrastructure. The open space area off the Eastern Ave ex- tension, as well as the shallow western edge of the Creek in this vicinity allow for potential green adaptations to create wetlands to serve a protective function. • Potential green adaptations to enhance wetland resources in this area consist of deposition to create nearshore marsh resources, living shoreline applications along the western bank Appendix A-21A-22 Appendix .sehcaorppa ycneiliser neerg dna yarg gnixim snoitulos dirbyh dna ,keerC aeslehC foAppendix A-23 .)devomer saera suoivrepmi lenap dnah tfel( aeslehC ni saera noitacfiissalc dnalteW 1102 .1 erugiFA-24 Appendix .)devomer saera suoivrepmi lenap dnah tfel( aeslehC ni saera noitacfiissalc dnalteW 0302 .2 erugiF .)devomer saera suoivrepmi lenap dnah tfel( aeslehC ni saera noitacfiissalc dnalteW 0702 .3 erugiFAppendix F Critical Public Infrastructure Scoring Guidance Appendix A-25This page intentionally blank A-26 AppendixAppendix A-27 ecnadiuG gnirocS -reS ycnegremE & ytefaS cilbuP tnemnorivnE & htlaeH cilbuP seitivitcA cimonocE & laicoS seciv ecivreS fo aerA slortnoc taht erutcurtsarfni lacitirC -mi si taht erutcurtsarfni lacitirC si taht erutcurtsarfni lacitirC yrogetaC gnitaR ssoL dna stnatullop ot erusopxe namuh evah elpoep gnirussa rof tnatrop -aucave ytinummoc rof tnatropmi larutan eht ot stcapmi yradnoces .sboj dna semoh rieht ot ssecca .esnopser retsasid dna noit .tnemnorivne tnedicni noitullop tnacfiingiS ro ssecca noitatropsnart fo ssoL esnopser ro noitaucave rojam fo ssoL erots taht seitilicaf ot egamad( dna stnediser fo sderdnuh rof ecivres .etuor .)slairetam suodrazah .saera laicremmoc rojam sretnec snoitarepo ycnegreme fo ssoL a ot egamad rojam ro ssol tnenamreP .)ecnalubma ,erfi ,ecilop ,WPD( lanoigeR ereveS 5 .ecruoser latnemnorivne tnacfiingis .snoitacinummoc ycnegreme fo ssoL ,noitareneg ytilitu fo ssoL .ytilicaf lortnoc ro ,noitubirtsid fo eruliaf( tneve noitullop tnacfiingiS ro ssecca noitatropsnart fo ssoL esnopser ro noitaucave lacol fo ssoL fo gnidoofl ,niam ecrof rewes rojam a ,sdoohrobhgien elpitlum ot ecivres evitanretla elbanosaer on ,etuor )noitats pmup a elgnis( stcapmi laicremmoc rojam on .elbaliava )ytilicaf tnacfiingis a ot egamad yraropmeT on ,sretnec lacidem fo ssoL ecruoser latnemnorivne elbanosaer on ,loohcs fo ssoL ni elbaliava evitanretla elbanosaer ediW ytiC hgiH 4 aeslehC ni elbaliava evitanretla aeslehC on ,retlehs ycnegreme fo ssoL ni elbaliava evitanretla elbanosaer .aeslehC snoitpursid ecivres ytilitU fo ssol( tnedicni noitullop roniM ro ssecca noitatropsnart fo ssoL tub ,etuor noitaucave fo ssol oN elohnam ro ,niam ecrof ronim ,rewes .doohrobhgien eno ot ecivres esnopser ycnegreme ot syaled rojam .)gnidoofl .sruoted ot eud semit evitanretla elbanosaer ,loohcs fo ssoL tnacfiingis ot egamad tnenamrep oN .aeslehC ni elbaliava elbanosaer ,sretnec lacidem fo ssoL ro saerA elpitluM .secruoser latnemnorivne .aeslehC ni elbaliava evitanretla etaredoM 3 sdoohrobhgieN ,retlehs ycnegreme fo ssoL ni elbaliava evitanretla elbanosaer .aeslehC .snoitpursid ecivres ytilitU stcapmi latnemnorivne roniM noitatropsnart fo ssol etelpmoc oN ycnegreme ot stcapmi rojam oN fo ssol ro/dna noisore htiw detaicossa ecneinevnocni tub ,ecivres ro ssecca .elbissop sruoted ronim ,esnopser aerA elgniS woL 2 .serutcurts .elbaliava ruoted – .noitpursid ecivres ytilitu roniM doohrobhgieN ro .snoitacilpmi noitullop rojam oN tcapmi oN tcapmi oN tcapmi oN ytreporp elgniS enoN 1This page intentionally blank A-28 AppendixAppendix G Probability of Exceedance Curve Data MWRA Headworks and Screen House Approx.

        "Designing Coastal Community Infrastructure for Climate Change EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The City of Chelsea is taking steps to pro-actively address its vulnerability to coastal flooding and build resiliency for changing climate conditions. City staff are actively engaged in the Metro Mayors Climate Preparedness Task Force and planning studies are being performed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, UMass Boston, and the American Geophysical Union. In support of these efforts, the City, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM), commissioned this climate change vulnerability assessment to: • Identify vulnerable areas of the City at risk of coastal flooding (under present day and projected future climate change conditions). • Assess flood risk and depth. • Prioritize infrastructure at risk. • Recommend adaptation measures of varying scale and complexity. The City and its partners are already advancing elements of the recommended adaptation measures and thinking creatively about how to integrate resilient approaches into future planning efforts. Each next step will help protect economic activities for the region, and critical public infrastructure and the built environment that support daily life. Executive Summary 1",
        "Figure S.1 Areas of Chelsea Vulnerable to Coastal Flooding Coastal Flooding Vulnerability With approximately 60% of its municipal boundary bordering tidally influenced waterways, Chelsea is especially vulnerable to coastal flooding. Once a network of waterways and tidelands, the low-lying areas of the City are, on average, less than 10 feet above sea level. Disruption of these natural systems by urban development has made these areas even more susceptible to coastal flooding under present day and future climate change conditions. The assessment team used the Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model (BH-FRM) to determine which areas of the City are most vulnerable to coastal flooding. The BH-FRM is a probabilistic, dynamic model, meaning that it includes the physical processes associated with storm events (e.g., waves, winds, tides, storm surge, etc.) and not just static increases in water levels (Bosma et al., 2016). BH-FRM also assesses future flood risk based on sea level rise projections and a range of potential storm events. This is the same model being used by other metro-Boston area municipalities, Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT), Massachusetts Port Authority, and other agencies. The model determines key flood pathways where coastal flood waters are predicted to enter the City. The five primary vulnerability zones within Chelsea are shown on Figure S.1. Collectively, these zones place approximately 36% of the City within a flood risk area under present day, 42% in 2030 and 49% in 2070. 2 Executive Summary",

Critical public infrastructure included City-, State-, and private utility-owned assets that provide critical public services. The decision to focus on public infrastructure was driven by the desire to provide Chelsea with some adaptation measures that can be implemented by the City in the near term, (for example, the results of this assessment are already being used to design improvements at the Carter Street pump station and at the Island End River site, as the City owns these properties). The decision was also based on the recognition that the assessment findings would support complementary resilience planning efforts by other public service providers including the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, MassDOT, and Eversource. Although the focus was on critical public infrastructure, the potential adaptation measures identified herein provide benefits to private property as well. A total of 12 critical public infrastructure assets were identified in the vulnerability zones based on the City’s Hazard Mitigation Plan (MAPC, 2014) and input by City staff. The assets were prioritized based on a total risk score that considered asset criticality (consequence) and likelihood of flooding (probability) now and in the future. Simply put, the higher the score, the higher the priority to implement adaptation measures to protect this asset. Executive Summary 3",
        "The findings show: • All 12 assets are distributed relatively evenly among four zones, with none occurring in the Mystic River Vulnerability Zone. • Five of the 12 assets are owned by the City, and four of these are located in the Island End River Vulnerability Zone. • The public infrastructure assets that are most critical to the region are also most at risk of coastal flooding under present day and future years. Flexible Adaptation Strategies Another interesting result of the modeling is that the locations where coastal flooding enters the City are anticipated to generally remain the same over time. However, the depth of anticipated flooding and resultant impacts will increase. This finding emphasized the need for shoreline and site-specific adaptation strategies that could be implemented in the near term, and are flexible enough to work over a range of future climate change conditions. The recommended adaptation strategy height is, on average, 2 feet in year 2030 and 5 feet in year 2070. Flexible adaptation strategies considered include ecological approaches that grow with sea level rise, and natural berms and hard structures that can be adjusted vertically in height or lengthened over time. Shoreline strategies account for the need to support Chelsea’s working waterfront within the Mystic River and Chelsea Creek Designated Port Areas. Depending on the specific site, adaptable flood walls (deployable and/or permanent) may need to be set back from the waterfront to preserve waterfront access (Figure S.2). At other locations, unique hybrid installations (green and gray infrastructure) are suggested (Figure S.3) . The City is also interested in exploring policy and planning based approaches to encourage more resilient building and site design. A collection of paired measures – site specific, shoreline and policy/planning – can offer the highest level of protection. Next Steps With the impacts of climate change being experienced both locally and across the globe, the City of Chelsea is planning for sea level rise and severe weather events. Inherent in the City’s vision is creating a forum within which public and private partners can see opportunities to act together for their mutual benefit. Such an approach will create opportunities for public/private partnerships and cost sharing. The key is to promote measures at all scales, in a coordinated manner, to address coastal flooding risks in the short term and long term. The City of Chelsea is devoted to incorporating a variety of adaptation and mitigation strategies to create a cohesive and united response to climate change. 4 Executive Summary",

        "1 INTRODUCTION Climate Change: “any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time, including major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns.” - US EPA (2014) We have all learned about climate change over the past decades: our use of fossil fuels is releasing levels of carbon into the atmosphere that cause higher air and sea surface temperatures. These higher temperatures are causing sea levels to rise and increasing the odds of natural hazards, including flooding, fire, earthquakes, landslides, and extreme storm events. The immediate concern is the implication climate change has on the natural and built environments around us. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy’s impact on New York and New Jersey revealed the severe damage that can come from an extreme weather event. Here in Massachusetts, we are already seeing a rise in sea levels and greater intensity and frequency of storms causing flooding. Coincidently, as this study began, world leaders met to negotiate and sign the world’s latest accord on climate change, the “Paris Agreement,” which set forth a new global action plan to deal with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance starting in the year 2020.

        "3 COASTAL HAZARD AND RISK MODELING Approximately 60% of the City's 7.8 mile municipal boundary borders tidally influenced waterways. Each of these bordering waterways -- Mystic River, Island End River, Chelsea Creek, and Mill Creek -- is part of the Mystic River Watershed which drains into Boston Harbor. Topographic mapping (Figure 3.3 on page 3-3) illustrates a The Mystic ridgeline, aligned north to southeast, dividing the City roughly River Watershed in half. From this ridgeline, water flows in the western direction includes 76 square to the Island End and Mystic Rivers, and in the eastern direction to the Mill and Chelsea Creeks. Inland from the stream's edge, a miles of land network of waterways and tidelands once flowed through what are area and 21 other now Chelsea's projected flood zones. Disruption of these natural communities. systems, by unregulated urban development, has made these areas (MyRWA, n.d.) vulnerable to coastal flooding. Coastal flooding occurs when the wind and tides overtop the shoreline and inundate low-lying areas. With an average elevation of less than ten feet above sea level, it is not surprising that approximately 20% of the City is mapped within a potential coastal flooding area in present day. Add on sea level rise projections of 0.6 feet in 2030 and 3.2 feet in 2070, and anticipated more frequent and intense storm events, this percentage increases to 35% in 2030 and 45% in 2070.

These maps illustrate the floodplain hugging the shorelines of the Mystic and Island End Rivers and include some low-lying areas adjacent to Chelsea and Mill Creeks. FEMA issued new FIRMs for Suffolk County, effective March 16, 2016. The FEMA FIRMs are included as Appendix C. Chelsea’s updated mapping shows a much larger flood risk area within the City, extending through the areas of the historic waterways shown on the 1903 mapping. Additionally, as part of the revised FEMA flood mapping process, the City of Chelsea intends to modify its Floodplain Overlay District to include the extents of the 2016 FIRM.

        "Figure 3.3 Topographic Map and Historic Water Lines in Chelsea (MassGIS) Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model Recognizing the limitations of FEMA mapping, communities and businesses in the Metro-Boston area are now using the Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model (BH-FRM), to evaluate which of their assets are vulnerable to coastal flooding. The BH-FRM is a dynamic model, meaning that it assesses future flood risk based on sea level rise projections and a range of potential storm events. The BH-FRM was developed by the Woods Hole Group as part of a Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Pilot Project to assess the effects of climate change on the Central Artery Tunnel System. The Pilot Project report explains that the “hydrodynamic modeling is based on mathematical representations of the processes that affect coastal water levels such as riverine flows, tides, waves, winds, storm surge, sea level rise, and wave set-up, at a fine enough resolution to identify site specific locations that may require adaptation alternatives (Bosma, et. al., 2015).” The BH-FRM models the topography, infrastructure, and other relevant local landscape information. Industry leading hydrodynamic and wave models1 were coupled to depict probable future sea level elevations and simulate tides, waves, winds, velocities, and riverine flows from a variety of storm types. A more in depth discussion of the “Probabilistic Modeling of Sea Level Rise, Storm Surge, and Waves” is provided in Appendix D. Coastal Hazard and Risk Modeling 3-3",
        "Maps were created for Chelsea for present day and future years 2030 and 2070. For this project, WHG has produced two types of maps for these time periods, displaying either the probability or depth of flooding . For the depth of flooding maps, one map depicts flooding depths associated with a 1% probability level (or 100-year flood level), and another map for a 0.1% chance flood (or 1,000-year flood level – a less frequent, more intense occurrence). There is not much variation in the What is Storm Surge ? City’s probable flood footprint between 2030 and 2070. This is An abnormal rise of water generated by not surprising for two reasons. First, a storm, over and above the normal tide the flood areas are topographically constrained to the low lying areas of range. (Adapted from NOAA) the City. Second, coastal flooding in Chelsea is primarily due to still water impacts and not significant wave action. So while the flood footprint doesn’t change, the likelihood and anticipated depths of flooding do increase over time.

Results are based on a hydrodynamic model developed for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (Famely et al. 2016). Note: This data does not take into account inland freshwater flooding. 3-4 Coastal Hazard and Risk Modeling",
        "Natural Resource Modeling It is also environmentally responsible for the City to consider the impact of sea level rise on natural resources, not just built infrastructure. The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was first developed with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funding in the 1980s. As part of the Statewide Modeling the Effects of Sea Level Rise on Coastal Wetlands Project for the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management, Woods Hole Group evaluated the impact of sea Salt Marsh level rise on wetlands and shorelines (credit: Matt Poole/USFWS, Flickr) throughout the Commonwealth. In Chelsea, the shorelines consist of tidal flats, rocky intertidal shoreline, coastal beach, coastal bank, salt marsh, shallow marsh meadow or fen, and salt marsh (see Table 3.1 below). Table 3.1 Wetland Resources Along Chelsea's Streams Wetland Resource Island End River Mystic River Chelsea Creek Mill Creek coastal beach • • • coastal bank bluff or sea cliff • • rocky intertidal shore • • salt marsh • • shallow marsh meadow or fen • tidal flats • • • • The model shows areas of likely coastal wetland loss due to higher water tables and more frequent flooding. These impacts may be mitigated by constructing living shorelines as an alternative to, or in addition to, hardened waterfront structures such as sea walls or bulkheads. Living shorelines use plants, sand, coir fiber logs, and stone to provide shoreline protection and maintain valuable habitat (www.habitat.noaa.gov). Further information on the SLAMM process and its results for Chelsea is provided in Appendix E. 1Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) models surface elevations of sea level rise and tidal effects of storm surges.

        "4 COASTAL FLOODING IN CHELSEA There are key pathways where coastal flood waters are predicted to enter the low-lying areas of the City. These pathways are identifiable by the areas with a high probability of flooding on the 2030 BH-FRM mapping (10-20%, shown on Figure 4.1 on page 4-2, in color purple). Interestingly, these flood pathways mimic the historic network of waterways and tidelands that existed prior to the urban development that occurred in the mid- to late-nineteenth century. Each of the identified flood pathways puts critical public infrastructure at risk. The pathways also have the potential to impact private commercial, industrial, and residential areas throughout Chelsea. From west to east, five zones vulnerable to flooding were identified: • Island End River • Mystic River • Lower Chelsea Creek • Upper Chelsea Creek • Mill Creek In total, these vulnerability zones comprise approximately 20% of the City’s land area under present day, 35% in 2030, and 45% in 2070. This footprint poses a major threat to public safety and the quality of life for people living and working in the City. It also has the potential for widespread regional impacts to food distribution and petroleum enterprises. The following pages look at each of the five identified vulnerability zones in closer detail.

        "I s l a n d E n d R i v e r V u l n e r a b i l i t y Z o n e General Description 290+ ACRES IN 2030 The Island End River is a tributary to the Mystic River. The western bank is in Everett, and the eastern bank is in Chelsea. This vulnerability zone generally extends from the Island End River at Beacham/Williams Street (a major freight corridor), north to Route 16, and east beyond Route 1 to the MBTA Commuter Rail Station. This area is a significant local and regional commercial, industrial, and food distribution center. The historic path of the river once extended through the New England Produce Center into Everett, and north through the existing commercial area to Revere Beach Parkway and Route 1. These low-lying areas were once extensive tidal flats and salt marsh, but the tidelands were dammed and filled to support development in the late 19th century. The Island River has been the subject of many years of hazardous substance remediation and natural resource restoration efforts. Today, the edge of the Island End River in Chelsea is characterized by tidal flats, coastal banks and beaches. The shoreline also includes armored slopes at Admiral’s Hill Marina, and salt marsh. The Market Street culvert discharges stormwater runoff from a 119-acre catchment area in Chelsea and Everett to the River. The Carter Street pump station is currently being redesigned to redirect flows from the catchment area to nearby underground systems rather than the culvert. Stormwater flows from other portions of Everett will continue to discharge at the culvert.

The MWRA has over 5 miles each of water and sewer lines within Chelsea. In addition to this piping network, MWRA’s Chelsea Facility and Chelsea Creek Screen House and Headworks are located within the City limits.

        "Additionally, the City has partnered with the EPA since 2011 to implement green infrastructure projects. These projects help reduce flooding impacts by decreasing the impervious footprint and encouraging stormwater to be absorbed (infiltrated) into the ground where it lands. Buildings Chelsea’s building infrastructure encompasses a wide range of commercial, residential, industrial, institutional, and governmental buildings within its 1.8 square mile land area. Public buildings include: • Emergency response facilities (Police, Fire, Emergency Management) • Schools, which are also used as emergency shelters • Public works facilities • Public housing • Government administration facilities (MA Information Technology Center, FBI, U.S. Post Office) Fortunately, in Chelsea, none of the City’s Police, Fire or Emergency Management buildings were found to be at risk of coastal flooding under the 2030 and 2070 planning horizons. Why are buildings vulnerable? Some of these buildings are within current Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood hazard areas and the City’s Floodplain Zoning Overlay District, but others are not.

        "There are two large tank farms in Chelsea – Gulf Oil upriver of the Chelsea Street Bridge and Global Petroleum, adjacent to the Tobin Bridge. These facilities provide petroleum products to greater Boston and MetroWest areas, as well as southern New Hampshire. The products are shipped by tanker or barge. Earthern berms and/or walls surround the sites, likely for spill containment. Telecommunications Telecommunications infrastructure systems in Chelsea include a combination of above ground and underground systems. Providers include Comcast, Verizon, and Crown Castle International. These providers serve residential, commercial, and institutional customers, including City Hall. The best way to defend against failure scenarios is to build greater capacity and redundancy into systems. However, this is hard to do in a highly competitive commercial market, where efficiency and profit are the key drivers. Why is telecommunication vulnerable? Telecommunication systems are susceptible to failure or destruction due to increased flooding and groundwater levels. These conditions can weaken foundations that support overhead poles and expose underground conduits to increased water and salinity levels. Prolonged inundation could compromise short term and long term system integrity and function, and reduce the overall lifespan of system components (e.g. sheathing and cabling). Recreational Recreational assets in Chelsea include a combination of waterfront and neighborhood parks. Mary O’Malley Waterfront Park, owned and maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, resides along the Mystic River, from the Island End River to the Tobin Bridge. Other existing parks within the mapped risk areas include Island End Park, Polonia Playground, PORT Park, Highland Park, and Chelsea Greenway Shared Use Trail. Also included are playgrounds and fields at the City's schools. Vulnerable Infrastructure 5-9",
        "The City also envisions creating a waterfront park at the end of the Chelsea Street Bridge (near the terminus of the Chelsea Shared-Use Path, being constructed along the BRT Silver Line). Public parks are particularly important to the quality of life for residents given the scarcity of open space and density of development. There are also two private marinas – the Admiral’s Hill Marina on the Island End River and Chelsea Yacht Club beneath the Tobin Bridge at the end of PORT Park, Marginal Street Broadway. How are parks vulnerable? Coastal flooding and higher groundwater elevations has the potential to permanently damage hard and natural surfaces at these parks. Likewise, the marinas are at risk of temporary inundation during storms and permanent inundation under future sea level rise projections. 5-10 Vulnerable Infrastructure",

A total of 12 public infrastructure assets are identified as being at risk. • Carter Street Pump Station • Broadway bridge over Mill Creek • City Yard • Chelsea Street bridge over Chelsea Creek • Chelsea High School • Railroad bridge over Mill Creek • Williams Middle School Complex • MWRA Chelsea Creek Headworks and • Burke School Complex Screen House • Meridian Street Bridge over Chelsea Creek • Electric Substation #488 • MWRA Chelsea Facility Critical Public Infrastructure 6-1",
        "Calculating Risk There are many different mathematical models that can be used to calculate a risk score to prioritize infrastructure assets/facilities. RISK = For this study, the goal was to use a system that was simple to follow CONSEQUENCE x PROBABILITY and easily communicated. A simple five-tier qualitative rating system (Table 6.1) was developed for determining a consequence score. This score was then multiplied by the probability (likelihood) of flooding under present day, 2030, and 2070 scenarios using the BH-FRM. Because the BH-FRM provides estimated areas of probable flooding, a weighting factor was also applied to the calculation. Assets/facilities within present day flood areas were given higher priority than those at risk in future years. The weighting factor assigns a 60% weight to infrastructure within the present day flood area, 30% to 2030, and 10% to 2070. The assets/facilities can then be ranked from highest to lowest, in order of priority, based on the total score. In other words, the higher the score, the higher the priority to investigate adaptation measures for the infrastructure. Consequence Table 6.1 Consequence Rating How critical is the asset? Public Safety Rating Area of Service Loss Economic Public Health & & Emergency Activities Environment Services 5 Regional Severe Severe Severe 4 City Wide High High High 3 Multiple Areas / Neighborhoods Moderate Moderate Moderate 2 Single Area / Neighborhood Low Low Low 1 Single Property None None None 6-2 Critical Public Infrastructure",
        "A consequence of failure score was calculated for each asset/facility. This score was based on adding the individual ratings (1 through 5) for each of the following four criticality criteria: Area of Service Loss: Who is impacted by the loss of or damage to the core functions of the asset? Public Safety & Emergency Services: How important is the asset to community evacuation and disaster response operations? Social & Economic Activities: How important is the asset to providing people with access or service to their homes and jobs? Public Health & Environment: How important is the asset to controlling human exposure to pollutants and secondary impacts to the natural environment? In addition to the above criteria, the Service Loss Duration was also considered. However, the City regards an asset that is out of service for more than one day as Severe and therefore this item was not given a consequence rating score as it would have been the same for all 12 assets. Table 6.2 below provides an example of how a facility may be rated and scored. Table 6.2 Example Criticality Rating: Carter Street Pump Station Rating Criteria Justification 119-acre catchment area in Chelsea 5 Area of Service Loss and Everett 5 Public Safety & Emergency Service Impacts major evacuation routes Loss of access to local commercial 4 Social & Economic Activities areas Controls human exposure to surface 4 Public Health & Environment contaminants 18 Total Consequence of Failure Score It is recognized that there is a certain level of interpretation or subjectivity applied when assigning consequence ratings. Appendix F includes the scoring guidance used for this study. Probability The likelihood of flooding under present day, 2030, and 2070 scenarios is based on data developed using the BH-FRM. A geographic data point for each public infrastructure asset was located in the BH-FRM. Based on a critical elevation at each location, an estimated depth of flooding was determined where the flood event has the probability to equal or exceed this depth in any given year (a 0.1 to 100% chance). In some cases, any depth of water would put a location at risk, whereas other locations can sustain core functions even with a few inches of water. The possibility that the water depth starts to impair an asset's core functions is calculated into the score. A detailed table of this data for each asset is included in Appendix G (Probability of Exceedance Curve Data). Critical Public Infrastructure 6-3",

Ownership: The majority of critical public infrastructure assets are not within the direct control of the City. In fact only, five of the twelve assets are owned by the City. This fact emphasizes the importance of engaging the other public service providers in the resiliency planning conversation. 2. Vulnerability Zones: The twelve critical public infrastructure assets are distributed relatively evenly among four vulnerability zones, with no assets in the Mystic River Zone. Four of the five City owned assets are within the Island End River Vulnerability Zone. 3. Total Risk Score: The public infrastructure assets that are most critical to the region are also most at risk of coastal flooding under the three planning horizons. As a result, these assets are ranked at the top of the priority list. Critical Public Infrastructure 6-5",

        "7 ADAPTATION MEASURES Identifying appropriate adaption measures to protect Chelsea from the effects of sea level rise and coastal storm surge could seem like an overwhelming task: Where do we start? What probability of flooding are we willing to accept? To what elevation should we design? How much will this cost? The first step is to realize that these measures will need Adapt: to be implemented over time with the help of public and private partners. The City does not need to do this To adjust or modify alone, or all at once. The key is to advance measures something to a particular at all scales, in a coordinated manner, to address coastal situation or circumstance flooding risks in the short term and long term. The second step is to realize that no adaptation measure is a fail-safe solution as no amount of modeling or planning can fully predict the future. This is an important reality that focuses our attention on identifying measures that provide public benefits in the near term and are flexible enough to work over a range of future conditions. Public benefits can include improved public access to the waterfront, and protection and enhancement of ecosystems, for example. Flexible approaches include berms or walls that can be adjusted vertically in height, or ecological installations that grow with sea level rise. Clever adaptation measures that incorporate such elements are more likely to gain the community and financial support needed for implementation. Adaptation Strategies 7-1",
        "For the purposes of this assessment, three different scales of climate change adaptation measures were considered: 1. Site specific measures that protect a single property 2. Shoreline measures that protect multiple properties 3. Policy- or regulation-based measures to provide city-wide protection standards Paired measures can offer the greatest level of protection. For example, a site-specific measure may function as a second line of defense to an area-wide focused shoreline measure. Policy or regulation-based measures are more far reaching and can guide or require coastal flooding adaptation elements as part of new construction or redevelopment projects. Site Specific Measures The decision to focus on public infrastructure is driven by the desire to provide the City with some adaptation measures that are within their own control and can be implemented in the near term. Therefore, the site specific measures below are focused on City-owned facilities identified through the prioritization process outlined in Chapter 6. This focus on City-owned facilities does not discount the importance of understanding how other public service providers are modifying their facilities to coastal flooding. Seven of the twelve identified critical public infrastructure assets are not within the direct control of the City. These seven facilities are owned by the MWRA, MBTA (MassDOT Rail and Transit Division), MassDOT Highway Division, and Eversource. Each of these entities is at varying stages of assessing the vulnerability of their infrastructure to climate change. The MWRA has flood preparedness plans in place and has already identified building envelope retrofits needed to protect their Chelsea facilities from coastal flooding. They also have remote and/or redundant operation and control capabilities for their facilities. The MBTA has started implementing site specific adaptation measures at other facilities and will be further considering climate change impacts as part of their Focus40 planning effort, the agency’s long range capital investment plan for the next 25 years. The MBTA is about to embark on a system-wide vulnerability assessment which will likely evaluate the MBTA railroad and bus corridors in Chelsea in more detail. MassDOT Highway Division has extensively studied the vulnerability of the Central Artery system and is looking to expand these efforts statewide. Eversource is in the process of assessing flood protection measures at their substation facilities. Any proposed flood-resilient improvements to the Chelsea facility would be done as part of a project separate from the Mystic - East Eagle - Chelsea Reliability Project. All of these providers are thinking about climate change, which should open the door for follow-up discussions about community-level resilience planning and future implementation phasing. 7-2 Adaptation Strategies",
        "The evaluation of site specific measures incorporates the research performed by Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) students and faculty advisors in conjunction with the City and MIT Sea Grant program. The result of their work is a report entitled Creation of Flood Risk Adaptation Measures for Critical Public Facilities in Chelsea, Design Parameters for Massachusetts, October 2015. Adaptation Measures The student’s research has proven to be a valuable resource for this study. For the purposes of this assessment, the proposed adaptation elevation above sea level is assumed to be 12 feet in 2030 and 15 feet in 2070. This translates to three to five foot tall installations. The elevations are based on the 0.1% exceedance probability shown in Appendix G, plus an In order to determine the elevation of adaptation measures approximate one foot of freeboard above considered for this assessment, the projected flood elevation in the Boston the following baseline data was Harbor Flood Risk Model (BH-FRM). utilized: 1. Existing ground elevations were estimated from MassGIS LiDAR data (from 2013-2014). 2. Elevations were estimated for present and future tide1, and flooding2 (see Table 7.1). Although not the focus of this assessment, consideration will also need to be given to how increased groundwater levels as a result of sea level rise could compromise the stability of building foundations, paved areas, and surrounding lands. In certain circumstances, high water tables may negatively impact a facility before coastal flooding, as a result of storm surge, is projected to occur.

        "Carter Street Pump Station The Carter Street Pump Station is located at the corner of Carter Street and Second Street adjacent to the Mystic Mall. The small structure houses three pumps approximately 25-feet underground that transmit storm and groundwater out of a 119 acre catchment area of Chelsea and Everett. Of this 119 acre catchment area, approximately 80% is in Chelsea. The pump station operates daily transmitting flows from this catchment area via a 30-inch force main to the Market Street culvert at the Island End River. The pump station is currently being redesigned to redirect flows from the catchment area to a new force main that will discharge to an existing 72-inch gravity drain on Spruce Street. The Market Street culvert will continue to receive flows from other portions of Everett. The approximate ground elevation at the pump station building is 5.5 feet above sea level (MassGIS LiDAR data from 2013-2014) and the pump station top slab elevation is 7.43 feet(Weston & Sampson). The 7.43 foot elevation represents the critical elevation at which floodwaters could begin to impact pump station operations. As shown in the probability of exceedance tables in Appendix H, there is a 0.1 to 2% probability, or likelihood, that coastal flood waters will overtop this slab in 2030, and 30% probability in 2070. To protect and maintain the functionality of the station under these future conditions, a number of adaptation measures are recommended inside and outside of the existing pump station building envelope.

        "The City has indicated their preference to construct a permanent wall around the pump station as the primary means of protecting the facility from coastal flooding. A permanent wall would enable City personnel to focus their storm preparation efforts on other critical tasks rather than spending valuable time erecting a temporary barrier. The wall will need to allow for scalable access by City personnel, such as through removable entranceways or ladder/stairs, and be designed to withstand the hydrostatic pressures of the floodwaters. The wall should have a top line elevation of 12 feet NAVD88 with design provisions to allow the wall to be heightened an additional 3 feet if future conditions warrant. A top of wall elevation of 12 feet NAVD88 correlates to a 6.5-foot wall from ground level (or a 4.5-foot wall above slab elevation). Other building envelope and equipment retrofits and/or relocations would provide secondary means of protection for the station. Recommendations include: • Install flood logs at doorways • Raise electrical and HVAC equipment • Raise or protect generator and fuel oil storage tank • Repoint/waterproof exterior masonry • Install watertight access hatches • Install a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) to provide remote control operation of major systems The cost of the perimeter wall and recommended building envelope and equipment retrofits and/ or relocations is estimated to be in the range of $500,000, up to $750,000 for programming purposes. A structural evaluation of the pump station building is also required to determine if additional structural reinforcement is required to withstand the hydrostatic pressures of the floodwaters.

        "Schools There are three public schools within the mapped flood risk probability area: Chelsea High School, Williams Middle School Complex, and Burke Elementary School Complex. In addition to serving the student community, each of these schools is used as an emergency shelter. The City expects the buildings will exceed a 50 year life span in the absence of a significant hazard event. • Chelsea High School: This school is located at 299 Everett Avenue, adjacent to Route 16, and serves the Grade 9-12 student community. The main building opened in September 1996 and a 500 student addition was built in 2002. • Williams Middle School Complex: This complex is located at 180 Walnut Street, just north of Route 1. This school complex includes 2 middle schools for Grades 5-8. These schools include the Joseph A. Browne School and the Wright Science and Technology Academy. This complex also opened in 1996. • Burke Elementary School Complex: This complex is located at 300 Crescent Street adjacent to Eastern Avenue and the MBTA railroad corridor. This school complex includes four elementary schools Chelsea High School & Burke Elementary School for Grades 1-4. These schools include the Complex (Google StreetView) William A. Berkowitz, Edgar F. Hooks, George F. Kelly, and Frank M. Sokolowski Elementary Schools. The Burke Complex opened in September 1996. The structural elements comprising the buildings’ foundations are assumed to be piles, grade beams and slabs based on available record plans. Typically, in a system of this kind, the grade beams are positively connected to the piles and the slabs are structural, spanning between and positively connected to the grade beams. The approximate ground elevation at the schools range from 6 to 10 feet above sea level (MassGIS LiDAR data from 2002-2014). And it is assumed that the critical elevation is within 6 inches (1 step) of the elevation. As shown in the Probability of Exceedance Tables in Appendix H, there is a 0.1 to 2% chance that coastal flood waters could overtop this slab in 2030, and 30% chance in 2070. In order to protect the schools from flood damage during their anticipated life span, exterior retrofits could include: • Modify window openings and reducing size • Install flood logs at the exterior doors and adjacent storefront glazing • Repoint/waterproof exterior masonry 7-6 Adaptation Strategies",
        "Unlike the pump station, the schools will not need to be operational during a coastal flood event unless they are intended to still function as emergency shelters. As an emergency shelter, not only would these buildings need to be flood resistant, but also allow people, goods and services in and out during the flood event. Accordingly, under coastal flood conditions, the building would require the addition of doors above the 3 foot line with portable ramps on the inside of the building. The assumption is, with the site under water, people, goods and services would come and go by boat. A better solution would seem to be to discontinue use of these buildings as emergency shelters. Instead, the City could make arrangments with neighboring towns having higher elevations, such as Everett, and one or more of their buildings could be designated to be Chelsea’s emergency shelters in the event of a flood. This would eliminate the need for difficult and costly modifications. City Yard The Department of Public Works (DPW) City Yard is located at 280 Beacham Street. The facility includes a larger hanger-style space where public maintenance vehicles and equipment are stored and serviced. There are also on-site offices for DPW and the water and sewer maintenance and operation staff. Road salt, excavated materials and street sweeper deposits are stored along the exterior perimeter of the property. Given the age and condition of the City Yard building and the City’s desire to eventually relocate DPW operations to a new location, no permanent measures are proposed at this location. Consideration could be given to two temporary adaptation solutions: 1. Temporarily relocating equipment prior to and during flood events to enable emergency response and cleanup operations. 2. Purchasing a deployable (portable) flood mitigation system. Deployable perimeter installations include paneling systems such as Aquafence or water inflated flood barriers such as Tiger Dams. Massport has purchased the Aquafence system for use at their critical facilities at Logan Airport such as the State Police Building. The cost for a 4 foot high installation is approximately $350 per linear foot based on the Massport example. The systems break down into roughly 5-foot by 5-foot crates. These installations need to be used in conjunction with a sump pump and stairs system to keep the interior dry during storm events and maintain access. The concern with these systems, especially in an urban setting, is the need to store the materials when not in use and routinely test the setups to verify they are still operational.

        "Shoreline Measures Recalling the discussion on flood pathways in Chapter 4, the Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model presents low-elevation locations where water is anticipated to enter the City (Figure 4.1). In response to this information, this section presents adaptation measures focused at the shoreline that could reduce the probability of coastal flooding. These shoreline adaptation measures will require significantly more time and effort to finance, design, permit, and construct than the site-specific measures presented above. The measures can range from 1,500 to 3,200 linear feet of shoreline and involve a combination of public and private properties. To make installations like this possible, it is crucial to open communication between the City, property owners, community, and regulatory agencies early in the planning process to gain support, develop partnerships, secure funding, and set realistic project timelines. What types of installations are recommended? Where feasible, natural systems and processes should be employed to help protect the City from coastal flooding and provide ecological benefits. The potential for “green infrastructure” installations exist where large areas of tidal flats or salt marsh line the shore. However, in many locations, industrial development and state regulations limit this type of installation and therefore engineered barriers should be utilized. Here, more traditional \"gray infrastructure\" is appropriate. Some locations may benefit from a hybrid of green and gray Living Shoreline infrastructure to provide protection for a wider range of potential flood depths. Coastal wetland plantings and berms can be designed to manage low to medium tidal flooding, where engineered walls could be provided for additional storm surge protection (NOAA, 2015). In any case, some shoreline installations can also provide an opportunity to benefit the surrounding community, including improved public access to the waterfront and enriching an area's visual character. Future design of these installations must keep in mind that the Mystic River and majority of Chelsea Creek are within a Designated Port Area (DPA). The water-dependent industrial properties in the DPA are regulated by the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and must maintain access to maritime transportation (among other specific regulatory requirements). This 7-8 Adaptation Strategies",
        "means that adaptation measure installations must not preclude future water dependent development opportunities. Depending on the site, this could mean that any vertical walls may need to be set back from the waterfront. In many locations, a deployable barrier (as discussed under Site Specific Measures) may be appropriate.

        "Gray Infrastructure Throughout Chelsea’s industrial waterfront areas, there is less opportunity to create the green infrastructure systems needed to reduce the impacts of future sea level rise and storm surges. Here, engineered barriers such as bulkheads and sea walls could help reduce the probability of coastal flooding. One benefit to constructing these steel and/or concrete structures is that they can be vertically extended over time. This would allow wall height to be increased in phases as data regarding future impacts from sea level rise and storm surges is refined. In some situations, a concrete cap or wall may benefit from aesthetic details, to soften the Bulkhead with railing, Charleston, SC visual impact. Concrete form liners can be designed with patterns to create an artistic statement and/or announce a particular place or neighborhood. Another way to break up a large wall could be to let community artists or schools paint murals, or designate an approved graffiti location to provide a creative platform for the city’s youth. What can be built at each location? Based on existing shoreline features, potential adaptation measures have been identified for each Vulnerability Zone described in Chapter 4.

        "Additional Considerations These adaptation measures must be permitted under public laws protecting natural, cultural and recreational resources along the shoreline. This includes requirements set by the: • Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA), M.G.L. c. 30, §61-62H • Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (WPA), M.G.L. c.131, §40 • Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1341 et seq., §401 / Massachusetts Clean Water Act, M.G.L. c. 21, §26-53 • Public Waterfront Act, M.G.L. c. 91 • National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), • Federal Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. §1451 et seq./ Massachusetts Coastal Zone Management Act, M.G.L. c. 21A, §2, 4 • Federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. c. 1344 §404 et seq. / Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. c.403 §10 A more in depth discussion of the local, state and federal permits/approvals associated with the above laws can be reviewed in Appendix I. It should be noted that although living shorelines have been constructed in the in states south of New England, there are not many in Massachusetts. The WPA Regulations were recently revised to include special provisions for ecological restoration projects, however there is not yet a specific option regarding the creation of living shorelines.

Today, Bass Creek is encased by a culvert about 500 feet upstream from Chelsea Creek, and the former tidelands are home to a busy industrial area. Low elevations along the shoreline still provide potential flood pathways into this vulnerable zone, threatening approximately 10% of Chelsea's land area. This includes the MWRA Chelsea Facility and Elementary School Complex on Eastern Avenue.

        "M i l l C r e e k V u l n e r a b i l i t y Z o n e Area Review Mill Creek has the most natural shoreline of Chelsea's four waterways, edged with tidal flats and salt marsh. Much of these wetlands end abruptly, however, with steep lawns, retaining walls, or stone revetment separating adjacent development. The decks of the Broadway Bridge and MBTA Railroad Bridge over Mill Creek sit just above the projected 2030 flood elevation. Furthermore, the bridge openings could make draining the floodwaters of a coastal superstorm difficult. There are currently no known plans to repair or replace the existing railroad bridge and the Broadway bridge was reconstructed in the 1990s.

        "Policy or Regulation Based Measures Any overall planning strategy will need to consider first whether it is appropriate to adopt a policy of managed retreat, adaptation, or defense. The decision as to which approach should be applied, and what role the City should play, is one that can only be taken at the policy level, and with the input of City board, commissions, and residents. The City’s Floodplain Overlay District encapsulates a portion of the flood pathways identified in this study, adhering to the boundaries of the 2016 FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps. Areas outside of the FEMA FIRM catchment area are not subject to the Flood Plain Overlay District. The City should explore embarking on a zoning study to assess regulatory modifications that facilitate retrofits of existing buildings and ensure new development proceeds safely and is constructed consciously in potential flood pathways. Such a study should approach the topic holistically while addressing building and site design vulnerabilities. Land use regulation is promulgated by M.G.L. Chapter 40 and overseen by the City’s Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) and Planning Board. These entities are tasked with reviewing development proposals for zoning conformance in the event that an applicant requires dimensional relief or accommodation for use. The determination of a development or renovation proposal’s compliance with M.G.L. Ch. 131 Section 40, the Wetlands Protection Act, is made by the City’s Conservation Commission. It is recommended that the City craft a resiliency review check-list for each of the boards and commissions. Addressing the probability of flooding, rising temperatures, and more volatile storm events, this checklist should encourage proper site, building, and landscape design. It should aim to effectuate the adoption of more in-depth resiliency measures by property owners/ developers while pragmatically contemplating the economic variables involved in the real estate market. Particularly, how to urge the adoption of measures by smaller property owners should be assessed, as many may not be able to absorb the net cost. Additionally, the ability of buildings and land to withstand, endure, and recover from severe weather events and flooding should also be explored in the crafting of a check-list. Existing examples of materials for boards & commissions are available from the Boston Conservation Commission, Urban Land Institute, the American Planning Association, and other entities. Structural resilience can be undermined if the appropriate building codes are not followed, which stipulate the bare minimum for safe, inhabitable, and functional buildings. Chelsea City Council adopted the Stretch Energy Building Code in 2016; a part-time Energy Coordinator staff position was also filled to advance the City’s energy agenda and initiatives. Aimed at designing for energy conservation and reducing emissions, the Stretch Energy Code is an effective policy tool. Beyond the “floor” provided by the building code, the City is recommended to investigate and adopt a series of best policy practices for fostering sound design, construction, retrofits, and maintenance of structures situated in flood-risk areas. Moreover, site and landscape design should also be included. This can be done collaboratively through the City’s Department of Planning and Development, the City’s Energy Planner, the MAPC, and related organizations active in sustainable design and construction. 7-34 Adaptation Strategies",
        "Through policy and planning, the City can encourage the creation of scalable site-specific adaptation plans for regionally significant facilities. Publicly, resilience plans should be considered for the City’s schools. Recreation area design should also respond to the risks characterized in this study. Moreover, with the City embarking on an update of its Open Space and Recreation Plan in 2017, climate adaptation and mitigation measures should be analyzed for use in varying types of parks and open space. For private industry and commerce, tailored site solutions could be pursued, in conjunction with the property’s owners, tenants, and stakeholders. For example, a study of the New England Produce Terminal’s vulnerability to climate change was conducted concurrent to this effort. Undertaken by the MAPC, American Geophysical Union, UMass Boston, and City of Chelsea, this constellation of organizations reflect the collaborative make-up that the City could choose to employ. Similar studies could be conducted for other industrial clusters vital to the regional economic, or posing a hazard to the City in a severe weather event. Overall, conceptualization and resulting activities should materialize as public-private partnerships and vanquish any cultural or educational barriers that may be present. In 2017, the City will embark on a Municipal Harbor Plan with the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management. Encompassing the Designated Port Area, this plan will chart the maritime future of Chelsea’s waterfront, accounting for projected economic, demographic, and climactic factors. Resilience should be an the underlying element present throughout this study. Specifically, design propositions in this study, which would need to comprehensively accommodate M.G.L. Ch. 91 regulations and access, could be incorporated into discussions about port infrastructure. Adaptation Strategies 7-35",

        "8 NEXT STEPS This assessment identified vulnerable areas of the City at risk of coastal flooding, prioritized public infrastructure in these areas, and recommended site, shoreline, and policy based adaptation measures. Following this assessment, additional efforts are needed to: Assess valued socioeconomic components in the five vulnerability zones The assessment should be broadened to include consideration of where residents live and work and their continued ability to maintain a high quality of life when these social and economic components of the built environment are at risk of coastal flooding under present day, 2030 and 2070 conditions. Valued socio-economic components include, but are not limited to: • Environmental Justice (EJ) neighborhoods • Number of residential units • Major employers, health care providers, and supermarkets In order to accomplish this goal, the population of these zones need to understand the topic of vulnerability and adaptation planning, and what it means to their daily life. Communicate the topic of vulnerability and adaptation to a wider audience A more robust public outreach and education process is needed to educate the public about climate change related vulnerability in their neighborhoods, the places they work, and the city in general. Creating this level of informed involvement will require peer to peer engagement at the neighborhood level, adaptation training for City staff/boards/ commissions, and the formation of working groups focused around each vulnerability Next Steps 8-1",
        "zone. Working group membership could include City Council members, non-profits, neighborhood groups, major employers/property owners, and public agencies with a vested interest in the specific vulnerability zone. With wider public understanding of these issues, the expectation is that residents, agencies, businesses, and property owners will become invested in the resiliency planning effort. Conduct supplemental modeling of key flood pathways Two supplemental hydrodynamic modeling efforts are recommended to better assess the probability of coastal flooding and support the public outreach and education process. First, street level analysis of the flood pathways in each of the vulnerability zones will allow for a better understanding of where coastal flooding will be concentrated and illustrate the value of action (or inaction). The street level analysis will also allow for further refinement of the adaptation measures developed to date. Second, a hydraulic study along Mill Creek, particularly in relation to the bridges crossing over the creek, is needed to assess future flooding and determine appropriate adaptation measures. Form public/private partnerships These next steps will highlight opportunities for the public, private, and non-profit entities in the City and neighboring municipalities to act together to improve community resilience for their mutual benefit. It is also hoped that these discussions will lead to the formation of public/private partnerships and cost sharing around agreed upon adaptation strategies and heighten the need to modify City ordinances and other policies to limit the vulnerability of future development. Again, no one single entity can do this alone, or all at once. Seek potential funding Funding is needed to design, permit, and construct the site specific and shoreline adaptation measures discussed in Chapter 7. In addition, some of the shoreline measures require land acquisition which will add to the overall project cost. The site specific measures can likely be funded through the City’s Capital Improvements Program and/or maintenance budgets. However, each of the shoreline measures requires a significant level of investment which cannot be independently borne by the City. In these locations, the City should seek to leverage City and private funds (corporations, foundations, non-profits) with a combination of state and federal funding grant funding from sources such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EOEAA). Consideration should also be given to phasing each project to spread out the overall project costs and allow for adequate time to secure the required environmental approvals. Creative funding and implementation strategies are needed to successfully advance the concept designs towards implementation. These additional efforts should be advanced in parallel in the near term recognizing that year 2030 is just over a decade away. Again, the City does not need to do this alone. The formation of strategic partnerships and engagement of local champions is critical to advancing the City’s resiliency agenda and address coastal flooding risks in the short term and long term. 8-2 Next Steps",

Although there are various options for modeling sea level rise and storm surge, the most accurate approach for assessing combined storm surge risk and sea level rise conditions is through the imple- mentation of hydrodynamic models that include the physical processes that are associated with storm climatology and propagation. The probabilistic model approach developed by Woods Hole Group is a comprehensive flood risk model that can accurately assess flooding risk under present day and future climate change conditions. The probabilistic modeling system is comprised of the Advanced CIRCulation model (ADCIRC), a two-dimensional, depth-integrated, long wave, hydrodynamic mod- el for coastal areas, inlets, rivers and floodplains that in this application is used to predict storm surge flooding, and the unstructured grid version of Simulating Waves Nearshore model (UNSWAN), a wave generation and transformation model. The ADCIRC model is tightly coupled with UNSWAN, dynamically exchanging physical processes information during each time step, to provide an complete and accurate representation of water surface elevations, winds, waves, and flooding along the coastline and upland areas. For example, the probabilistic model includes important physical processes such as wave setup, wind stresses, and wave-current interaction such that these processes are included in the flooding dynamics of the coastline. This model has been successfully applied and used in Boston, MA and the Boston Harbor Area for assessing potential vulnerabilities in the Central Artery tunnel system. The model, called the Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model (BH-FRM) is the model that is being used to provide the results for the City of Chelsea. Full details on the model can be obtained from the report (https://www.massdot.state.ma.us/highway/Departments/EnvironmentalServices/ EMSSustainabilityUnit/Sustainability.aspx). The model is currently being extended to the entire coastline of Massachusetts. Numerous communities are applying the probabilistic model results to as- sess vulnerabilities and design adaptations. The model is also regularly being used to prioritize climate change adaptations and engineering designs such that communities can direct funding to the most critical areas of need first without being encumbered by financial constraints to fix everything at once. If applied, the model results can be used to assess the vulnerability and risk of coastal flooding for Chelsea infrastructure and natural resources, as well as provide design condition inputs and adaptation and resiliency options for the Town. The probabilistic modeling approach simulates a statistically robust set of storms (both tropical and extra-tropical) for each climate change and/or Sea Level Rise (SLR) scenario through a Monte Carlo statistical approach (Figure 1). Results of the Monte Carlo simulations are used to generate Cumu- lative Probability Distribution Functions (CDFs) of the storm surge water levels at a high degree of spatial precision. In particular, an accurate and precise assessment of the exceedence probability of Appendix A-15",
        "combined SLR and storm surge, provided at high spatial resolution help decision makers identify areas of existing vulnerability requiring immediate action, as well as, areas that benefit from present plan- ning for future preparedness. Results of the Monte Carlo approach also produce a statistically robust, spatially variable map of risk for each given SLR scenario that can be used to determine the potential need for adaptation, and the timing for potential adaptation, at each facility and for each infrastructure asset. Specific adaptations can also be provided to the model (both gray and green designs) and the model can be re-simulated with these adaptations or solutions in place. As such, the model can be used to predict the effectiveness of various resiliency options and the influence the adaptations have on the nature, extent, and depth of flooding probabilities. The model results also can be, and have been, tied directly to economic models that assess the cost implications of future climate changes and associated adaptation options. Figure 1.

        "Appendix E Chelsea Natural Resource Evolution Summary These results are part of the Statewide Modeling the Effects of Sea Level Rise on Coastal Wetlands for Massachusetts Coastal Zone Management. (ENV 14 CZM 08 in publication, 2016). Background: Climate change, with increased storm intensity, changes in precipitation patterns, and global sea- level rise will exacerbate already difficult coastal management issues related to both infrastructure and natural resources (Bosma et al., 2015). Recent studies have identified sea-level rise as one of the most certain and potentially destructive impacts of climate change (Meehl et al., 2007). Coastal wetlands are among the most susceptible ecosystems to climate change, especially accelerated sea-level rise. Nicholls et al. (2009) points out that coastal wetlands, including salt marshes and intertidal areas, could experience substantial area losses due to sea-level rise. Because coastal wetlands are extremely productive ecosystems, and provide a variety of ecosystem services, such as flood protection, waste assimilation, nursery areas for fisheries, and conservation and recreation benefits, such loss would have a high human cost. Recognizing the threats posed by climate change and sea-level rise, the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) desired to assess and analyze the effects of sea-level rise on coastal wetlands for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (ENV 14 CZM 08 in publication, 2016). The project’s intent was to simulate the effects of sea-level rise using an ecological model and implement the model at its highest level of complexity. The model selected to evaluate the impact of sea level rise on coastal resources was the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM), originally developed with EPA funding in the 1980s. The SLAMM model attempts to capture the major coastal processes, at least at a rudimentary level, involved in wetland conversions and shoreline modifications expected to occur over a long term. The results of the marsh migration modeling are intended to be used for future coastal planning in a number of ways. For instance, model results from this project can be used to identify areas with barriers to landward migration of salt marshes. These results can therefore serve as a guide for development and implementation of adaptation strategies for coastal managers and policymakers to proactively address potential impacts from long-term sea-level rise. The results produced for the City of Chelsea have been extracted from the larger CZM Commonwealth of Massachusetts project for this particular study. Appendix A-17",
        "Input Data: High resolution elevation data may be the most important Sea Level Affecting Marsh Migration (SLAMM) model data requirement, since the elevation data demarcate not only where salt penetration is expected, but also the frequency of inundation for wetlands and marshes when combined with tidal range data. Input elevation data also helps define the lower elevation range for beaches, wetlands and tidal flats, which dictates when they should be converted to a different land-cover type or open water due to an increased frequency of inundation. For this project, LiDAR was acquired from MassGIS. The majority of the state was covered with the 2011 USGS LiDAR for the Northeast project, and this covers the Hull area. In order to reduce processing time within the SLAMM model, areas of higher elevation within each regional panel that are unlikely to be affected by coastal processes, such as sea level rise, were excluded prior to processing; all areas above an elevation of 60 feet (NAVD88) were clipped from the input files. Wetland Classification Information: The 2011 wetland layer developed by the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) is used as the baseline source for the wetlands input file for marsh migration modeling. Utilizing the NWI data had two key benefits over the 1990s MassDEP wetland layer. First, the NWI data not only provided a more recent dataset, but also more closely temporally matches that of the LiDAR datasets. The second benefit to utilizing the NWI data is that it streamlined the conversion between source wetland categories and Sea Level Affecting Marsh Migration (SLAMM) model wetland codes. The documentation provided with the SLAMM software contains a key to convert each NWI classification to the wetland classification system used by SLAMM. A summary of this conversion key is present in Table 1. Sea Level Rise Projections: The Sea Level Rise (SLR) projections are consistent with those used in the BH-FRM modeling to produce the inundation proba maps. As such, there SLR used in the marsh migration modeling is consistent with the values used it the flood risk modeling for the City of Chelsea. Additional Data Input: Additional model input includes, but is not limited to, accretion rates (marsh, beach, etc.), erosion rates, tidal range and attenuation, freshwater parameters, dikes and dams, and impervious surfaces.

Allowing the SLAMM model to utilize the impervious layer would “protect” developed upland areas (i.e. impervious areas would not be allowed to convert to other land cover types); however, this approach would have prohibited marshes and wetlands from expanding into currently “developed” areas. While in reality this may likely happen (marsh migration would halt at the impervious boundary), this approach to the modeling does not inform stakeholders where the marsh may desire to migrate Appendix A-19",
        "given the elevation landscape if the impervious features were absent. Since one of the project goals was to determine how and where the marsh may want to migrate in response to sea-level rise, it was desired to determine what system were susceptible to ecological losses due to inability to adjust to the changing climate both independent of the impervious landscape and with it in place. As such, the SLAMM model simulations were run without the impervious layers (to show where natural resources would like to migrate in absence of anthropogenic influences) and subsequently the impervious layer was also overlain on the results to indicate where areas may likely not be subject to natural resource migration due to the built environment. In Chelsea, which is predominantly developed, the impervious overlay illustrates the limited areas that are available for natural resource migration. Figures 1 through 3 show the wetland classification areas for 2011, 2030, and 2070 timeframes, respectively, for the City of Chelsea. Figures present maps with no impervious overlay (left hand panel in each figure) and with impervious overlay (right hand panel in each figure). Figure 1 presents the current conditions, as defined by the NWI. Subsequently, Figure 2 shows the change in wetland classification locations projected to 2030, impacted by SLR. Similarly, Figure 3 shows the change in wetland classification locations projected to 2070, impacted by SLR. City Wide: Although the SLAMM results project some minor wetland expansion and loss of upland area in 2030, and significantly more in 2070 (based on the left hand panels), a vast majority of these areas occur within developed and residential neighborhoods (based on the right hand panels). However, due to the high density of development and impervious surface in Chelsea is it unlikely that the majority of these areas will be allowed to transition to wetland. However, these developed areas will likely experience higher water tables, increased salt water intrusion, day to day nuisance flooding, and higher frequency of storm flooding. Therefore, these areas will likely need additional protection in the future under normal tidal conditions sea level rise conditions (no storms). For example, by 2070 (Figure 3), the SLAMM model projects that the industrial and residential areas near the Gulf Oil terminal east of Chelsea Creek will begin to transition to water levels that would support irregularly flooded marsh and transitional scrub-shrub wetland. Similarly, by 2070 (Figure 3), the model suggests that Willow St. and Highland Park area will experience more regular nuisance flooding creating a transitional scrub-shrub wetland (absent impervious area. There are, however, a few undeveloped or less developed areas within Chelsea that will likely experience significant changes in land cover and wetland type and may offer opportunities for natural resource management and/or expansion due to the changing climate. These areas include: • The Mill Creek corridor, • The area around the Island End River • The Chelsea Creek region just north of the Gulf Oil terminal and near Merritt Park The Mill Creek Corridor: • In the relative near term (between 2011 and 2030), there are minimal changes to the Mill Creek wetlands, which primarily consists of open water, irregularly flooded marsh, and fresh marsh resources. At the head of the creek, there are some minor changes by 2030 as salt laden water is able to further penetrate upstream in the system. Inland fresh wetlands A-20 Appendix",
        "begin to transition to irregularly flooded marsh areas and transitional scrub shrub areas. By 2070, a majority of the creek system has transitioned to regularly flooded marsh and estuarine open water. • No immediate adaptations are required for this area in terms of natural resources as the Mill Creek corridor can be allowed to advance naturally for normal tidal conditions; however, in the long-term, and during storm events, more frequent overbank flooding can be expected to surrounding properties and the fringe marsh areas may be expected to expand. Smaller proactive restoration measures could be considered along the Mill Creek shorelines to protect infrastructure residing along the creek banks as well as to provide natural resource expansion and protection. Potential options could consider living shoreline applications and targeted thin layer deposition projects that would involve the placement of clean, compatible sediment in thin layers on the existing salt marsh to assist the elevations in keeping up with the rising tidal increases. Island End River: • The Island End River, which historically extended further to the north-northwest in Chelsea, is primarily open water with some limited salt marsh resources located at the head of the system. By 2030, minor expansion of the salt marsh areas is expected, including development of fringe marsh along the eastern bank of Island End River. By 2070, the salt marsh resources would migrate and expand to the north; however, much of this area is currently developed and would be faced with normal tidal nuisance flooding on a daily basis. • Due to the overall vulnerability of this area to storm surge, the relatively focused pathway for flooding, and, in the long-term, daily flooding, adaptations should be considered that focus on protecting upland areas while also enhancing natural resources. Hybrid solutions consisting of green infrastructure that expands valuable and protective marsh resources via a living shoreline solution coupled with secondary defense components of natural berms is one potential option that serves to provide green resiliency. Efforts could also be made with expanding the public interaction with the water through integrated, elevated walkways and water access as part of a berm system. An outfall forebay to treat stormwater runoff, if the current outfall is left in place, could also be integrated into the overall hybrid design along the shoreline. This green resiliency option could extend and connect to the Mary O’Malley Waterfront Park to enhance both the wetland resources and the future recreational space. The Chelsea Creek region north of the Gulf Oil terminal: This area shows little change between 2011 and 2030. By 2070 there is normal tidal flooding that is expected throughout the Eastern Avenue area. While there isn’t significant wetland re- sources in the area, due to the highly developed nature of this region (and the significant imper- vious area), there is an opportunity to expand wetland resources in this area, while also providing resilience and protection to upland infrastructure. The open space area off the Eastern Ave ex- tension, as well as the shallow western edge of the Creek in this vicinity allow for potential green adaptations to create wetlands to serve a protective function. • Potential green adaptations to enhance wetland resources in this area consist of deposition to create nearshore marsh resources, living shoreline applications along the western bank Appendix A-21",
