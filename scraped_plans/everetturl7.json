All of these impacts are projected to worsen under a variety of future climate scenarios, though how bad they will get is dependent on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the ability to improve adaption options for City systems and communities.

The burden of these impacts will be unevenly experienced across Seattle. Areas with less community services—such as grocery stores, parks, libraries, and transit options—often coincide with neighborhoods that were historically redlined and have a higher population of residents of color, non-English speaking residents, and older adults, and these areas will also be more vulnerable to climate-related extreme events. Aging infrastructure systems will be more vulnerable to climate-related hazards, as they are less able to mitigate climate-related hazards or cope with extreme events. Many systems are inherently connected so impacts to one system will often cascading impacts to other systems, services, and assets. While Seattle’s systems and assets are fairly resilient to the impacts of climate change, consequences and damages are still very likely to happen during and after extreme events. Executive Summary | 5Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Climate change is affecting all areas of Seattle.

Extreme events – such as the 2021 heat dome event or the 2022 King Tide �lood event – are likely to continue to occur, leading to cascading and compounding impacts for residents, businesses, and systems. For example, the 2021 heat dome event led to peaks in heat- related emergency calls and heat-related injuries, impacts to highways and public transit systems, and temporary business closures. These extreme events may have long-term mental and community health impacts – such as anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder.

Acknowledgments | 8Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Introduction Urgency to Address Climate Vulnerability Climate change and climate-related extreme events are already affecting the residents, industries, natural systems, and infrastructure of Seattle in multiple ways. Coastal areas and shorelines – such as Alki Beach and South Park – have seen more frequent and more intense coastal �looding. Low lying areas – such as the Duwamish Valley and Georgetown area – are seeing more extreme urban �looding. Interactions between coastal and riverine �looding, such as the tidally in�luenced riverine �looding during the 2022 King Tide �looding in South Park, illustrate how compound events may lead to extreme events that exceed model projections. The consequences of some climate impacts are ampli�ied by industrialization and historical disinvestment, leaving some residents and businesses with fewer resources and lower capacity to withstand climate-related hazards and extreme events. Additionally, there have been unprecedented climate-related extreme events and impacts. Wild�ire smoke days were historically rare occurrences in Seattle, yet have become an annual occurrence since 2015, affecting outdoor workers’ health and the safety of outside activities. The 2021 heat dome event – where temperatures in June reached an unprecedented 108°F, are associated with hundreds of premature deaths across Washington state, and affected the city’s infrastructure systems in a myriad of ways – is partially attributable to climate change (Philip et al., 2022; White et al., 2023). The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6) reaf�irms the urgency to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change through robust and comprehensive action. The IPCC AR6 projects that many climate change impacts will continue to worsen with the current emissions trajectory, and that adaptation will be necessary across multiple sectors and geographies to avoid some of the worst impacts. Additionally, there will be “climate surprises” – or impacts that we have not yet anticipated – that will occur in the future (Lee et al., 2023). In response to the urgency to respond and address climate change, the state of Washington has enacted multiple policies and programs to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The Washington Department of Commerce is developing guidance for counties and cities to leverage climate mitigation and adaptation bene�its into comprehensive planning – a planning process used to guide local governments to invest in development and growth in sustainable ways. Introduction | 9Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Purpose The City of Seattle’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) is a detailed assessment of how climate change is already affecting and will continue to affect the community wellbeing, economy, health, infrastructure, and natural systems of the city. While this CVA illuminates how climate change impacts a variety of sectors, this CVA is not intended to be a comprehensive assessment of all risks and hazards to such systems. For example, this CVA is not meant to be used as a hazards risk assessment for emergency planners or an economic risk assessment for economic development professionals. Rather, this CVA is used to identify ways that climate change has already affected and will continue to affect various One Seattle Comprehensive Plan systems and complement other types of risk assessments. This CVA was developed to inform the , or the City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan update, which will guide City policies and decisions on housing and job development and how the City invests in transportation, utilities, parks, and other public assets. This CVA can support the development of speci�ic climate-related policies in the One Seattle Comprehensive Plan to build resilience and reduce vulnerabilities from climate change across the city’s communities, geography, and systems. Additionally, the CVA can support the implementation of One Seattle Comprehensive Plan’s policies to ensure that investments are focused in areas that are more vulnerable to the current and future impacts of climate change. This CVA was funded by the Washington Department of Commerce capacity building grants to support local governments across the Washington state to develop and integrate climate cChalnigme adaapttaetio nV anud mlnitigeatrioan pboliicliiets yint oF threair rmespeectwive oCormkpr ehensive Plans. Climate vulnerability is the propensity or the predisposition to be negatively affected by climate change and climate-related hazards. Exposure, sensitivity, and adaptative capacity are the components that in�luence a system’s vulnerability to climate change. This assessment uses the following de�initions of climate exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive • Exposure capacity to better understand climate vulnerabilities for this CVA (Figure 1): is the degree to which a system is exposed to climate hazards.

For example, access to a vehicle and health insurance increase people’s adaptive capacity to manage health impacts from extreme heat, smoke, and any injuries related to climate hazards. Introduction | 10Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Exposure and sensitivity increase vulnerability, while adaptive capacity helps to decrease Figure 1. Climate Vulnerability Framework vulnerability. Adaptive Exposure Sensitivity Vulnerability Capacity Notes: The components of climate vulnerability are exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (Lee et al., 2023). Climate vulnerability is in�luenced by environmental, institutional, economic, and cultural factors. Communities that have been historically marginalized and excluded from decision- making processes based on their race, income, age, gender identity or expression, or other factors are likely to have elevated exposure, sensitivity, and/or lower adaptive capacity as a result. Identifying and addressing structural inequities is an important step in documenting Sclimtartue vculnteurabrielity oandf btuihldiinsg a mAorse sreseilisenst Semattlee fnor tal l. The re are �ive primary focus areas within this CVA. They are designed to align with City departments’ operations and planning processes. The focus areas are de�ined below (Table Table 1. CVA Focus Areas and De�initions 1). Focus Area Definition Economy Climate change impacts to the local economy, including local businesses, workers, and other economic factors. Public Health Climate-related health outcomes in Seattle and relative health risks – including physical and mental health – across the city. Community Likely climate change impacts to community assets and services, Amenities and including food access, parks, and critical facilities, which bene�it Wellbeing wellbeing. Infrastructure Effects and implications of climate change impacts to energy, transportation, and water infrastructure in Seattle. Natural Systems Climate impacts to local natural systems, including urban and regional watersheds, urban forests and open spaces, and aquatic habitats. This CVA considers both physical and socioeconomic vulnerabilities to climate change within each focus area. It focuses within the geographic boundaries of the City of Seattle but acknowledges the effects of climate impacts beyond Seattle’s borders. After the focus areas Introduction | 11Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Cascading and Compounding Climate Impacts chapters, the CVA explores ways that climate vulnerabilities intersect, as seen during the 2021 heat dome event (see section). Introduction | 12Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Approach and Methodology Methodology Overview This CVA leverages research available across City, federal, state, and peer-reviewed sources to assess how vulnerable various systems across the city are to climate change. One key value-add of this assessment is that it provides a spatial analysis of relative vulnerability at the census tract level in the social and economic vulnerability assessment section, drawing on robust census tract-level data across the city and leveraging downscaled climate Reviewed and Synthesized Documents projection data. As a �irst step, the project team reviewed the landscape of current climate change risks and plans across multiple City and regional reports. This CVA builds on a solid foundation of climate research, data, and planning to provide an analysis speci�ic to Seattle and areas wCiitthy ionf tSheea tctliety p. l ans & documents: Regional plans & documents: • • • • City of Seattle’s Climate Preparedness Plan Our People, Our Planet, Our Power Seattle Public Utilities Drainage and Powering the Transition: Community • Wastewater System Analysis Priorities for a Renewable and Equitable • • Future Seattle Public Utilities’ Shape of Our Water • State of Knowledge: Climate Change in Puget City of Seattle’s Climate Action Plan • Sound Seattle Hazard Identi�ication Vulnerability • 3rd National Climate Assessment’s Assessment • • Northwest chapter City of Seattle’s Duwamish Valley Action Plan 4th National Climate Assessment’s Seattle City Light’s Climate Change • Northwest chapter • Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation • Peer-reviewed publications Plan Additional government reports, plans, and Seattle Parks and Recreation’s Climate • studies Resilience Strategy • City of Seattle 2019 Water System Plan Seattle City Light’s Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation Plan Approach and Methodology | 13Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Assessed Elements of Climate Vulnerability Social and Economic Vulnerability Assessment Physical Vulnerability Assessment. This CVA is broken into two primary sections: a and a The Social and Economic Vulnerability Assessment assesses the relative vulnerability to climate change across several focus areas, including the city’s economy, amenity access and community wellbeing, and public health. The Physical Vulnerability Assessment assesses how ecological systems and infrastructure are affected by climate change. Objectives and focus areas for each type Table 2.

The project team developed a potential list of sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators by referencing comparable vulnerability assessments, such as those from the City of Redmond (WA) and Los Angeles County (CA), as well as a technical guidance document from the University of Notre Dame (BERK Consulting, Inc.; Perteet; The Watershed Company; UW Climate Impacts Group, 2022; LA County, 2021; Chen, et al., 2015). After developing an initial list, the project team solicited additional potential indicators and data sources from City staff members and through additional data requests to City staff. • Is the data relevant? The project team then vetted the potential indicators by asking the following questions: The project team used indicators that are as recent as possible and that have clear connections to climate change. Approach and Methodology | 14Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment • Is the data available? • Is the data high qualitDya? tasets need to be publicly available or shareable without sensitive and identi�iable data being share d. • Is the data at a census traTchte-l pevroejle rcet stoealumti aovno?i ded datasets that are incomplete and sought local datasets whenever possible. • Does the data show variability across the cityT? he project team included all census tracts that are within city boundaries and that overlap with city boundaries. Some datasets are relevant, high quality, and available at the census tract level, but do not show any variability across the city and are therefore not useful for the indices. Once the project team selected indicators, we normalized each dataset into indices to allow for comparability between census tracts. The equation weights exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity equally in the analysis to calculate a vulnerability index (see equation below) for each census tract. Indices are on a scale of zero to one, where zero means lower vulnerability and one means higher vulnerability. n n n 1 1 1 1 1 1 Vul. Index= × �Exp. Index+ × �Sen. Index+ × �Adap.

The Physical Vulnerability Assessment examines how infrastructure and natural systems are at risk due to climate hazards. For this assessment, the project team mapped how different assets – such as open spaces and parks or transit infrastructure – are exposed to various climate impacts including heavy precipitation and urban �looding, extreme heat, and sea level rise.

Traditional risk or vulnerability assessments typically treat hazards independent from one another. However, systems – social, economic, and infrastructure systems – are interconnected. Thus, climate change impacts to one system will inevitably have cascading or compounding effects across multiple systems (May et al., 2018). However, many of these impacts are dif�icult to model or predict because of their interdependent nature, leading to potential “surprises” – or events and impacts that fall outside the scope of climate models (Kopp et al., 2017). Currently, there are limitations in how to quantitatively evaluate cascading and compounding impacts from these extreme events (Kopp et al., 2017). There is lag-time Approach and Methodology | 16Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment between the occurrence of extreme events and documentation of these events in the peer- reviewed literature base (Roesch-Mcnally et al., 2020). Thus, to assess the compounding and cascading impacts from climate change, we rely on a case study approach and a mix of sources including peer-reviewed literature, media reports, and City plans and documents. We used two different case studies to illuminate the new and emerging ways climate change is affecting local communities, which include: 1) the 2021 heat dome event, and 2) the 2022 King Tide �looding that coincided with a historic winter storm and atmospheric rCiveirt eyve nSts. t aff and Community Partner Engagement City Staff Engagement The City convened City staff to guide the CVA process. Eighteen representatives participated in two meetings to provide input on the methodology, data sources, and initial �indings of the CVA. These representatives also participated in a draft review process to add comments to the full set of �indings. The following departments had staff who engaged with the • development of the CVA. • • City Budget Of�ice • Seattle Department of Construction & Inspections • Of�ice of Emergency Management • Finance and Administrative Services • Of�ice of Planning & Community Development • Of�ice of Sustainability & Environment • Of�ice of Economic Development • Seattle Department of Transportation • Seattle City Light • Seattle Public Library Seattle Public Utilities Seattle Parks and Recreation In addition to meeting with City staff, there were meetings with individuals from the Of�ice Meetings with Key Community Partners of Planning & Community Development and Emergency Management. The City held a meeting to review the CVA methodology and initial results of the CVA with a set of key community partners. The same group of partners provided feedback on the full • draft CVA.

Approach and Methodology | 18Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Climate Change Trends and Projections The climate of western Washington has been rapidly changing since the 1900s (Mauger et al., 2015; May et al., 2018). The region has experienced warmer air temperatures, reduced mountain snowpack, increasing wild�ire risk, sea level rise, and changing precipitation patterns that affect the region’s communities, economies, and infrastructure systems. The climate in the Paci�ic Northwest is affected by natural climatic patterns and processes— such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)—that can make some impacts more pronounced in individual years. The following sections provide an overview of various climate change impacts and how Fexploosuore dto ithnesge i mpacts are unevenly distributed across the City of Seattle. Historically, �looding has affected various parts of Seattle and is one of the most costly and destructive types of climate-related events (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2019). Seattle experiences three types of �looding: riverine �looding, coastal �looding, and urban or pluvial �looding. For example, areas around Longfellow and Thornton creeks experience riverine �looding, areas along West Seattle’s shores experience coastal �looding, and areas along Madison Valley experience urban �looding (Figure 2). Climate Change Trends and Projections | 19Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 2. FEMA 100-year and 500-year Flood Zones in Seattle Notes: This map shows sea level rise of 3.1 feet (using a 1% likelihood scenario and including storm surge) in the Duwamish Valley of Seattle. There are several blocks along the river shown to be inundated with seawater (City of Seattle, 2022). Flooding impacts can be exacerbated by impervious surfaces, often associated with development and industrialization. The coincidence of low-lying areas – or areas where water is likely to pool and collect in the city – with areas of more impervious surface coverage can lead to ampli�ied �looding risks, especially during heavy rain events that increase volume and �low into these areas. Impervious surfaces are correlated with pluvial �looding in Seattle; systems with inadequate conveyance capacity will not be able to effectively cope with �looding events. Some areas, like the Duwamish Valley and South Park, experience a con�luence of �looding types, amplifying the �looding impacts and associated consequences (Figure 3). Historically redlined areas in Seattle generally have a higher extent of impervious surfaces (Conzelmann et al., 2022). Some of these areas, such as the Georgetown neighborhood, experience a signi�icantly higher risk of �looding than other low-lying areas, such as Montlake (Figure 3) (Risk Factor, 2020). Climate Change Trends and Projections | 20Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 3. Low-lying Areas with Capacity-constrained Drainage and Impervious Surfaces that are at High-Risk of Urban Flooding Notes: The map indicates several areas in South Park, Georgetown, Rainier Beach, Sunset Hill, and Meadowbrook neighborhoods where low-lying areas with capacity-constrained drainage and impervious surfaces overlap, making it more likely for these areas to experience �looding after heavy rains. Low-lying areas are areas in Seattle that lie under 82 feet (25m) of elevation; capacity constrained systems layer from SPU; and areas of impervious surfaces are from the City of Seattle. These layers are used as proxy layers to assess current urban �looding risk (City of Seattle, 2022). Flooding risks will continue to affect Seattle. Areas that have historically �looded will �lood more often and new areas may experience infrequent �looding events in the future. All �looding types are expected to become more intense and more frequent, due to climate drivers such as sea level rise and extreme precipitation events, whose trends and impacts are documented in subsequent sections (Table 4). Climate Change Trends and Projections | 21Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Table 4.

Urban Flooding Sea level rise can raise groundwater Extreme precipitation can increase the tables, affecting conveyance systems and water volume and �low into low-lying reducing capacity of �lood water areas, increasing urban �looding risk. in�iltration. Sea Level Rise Sea level rise is driven by a variety of factors related to global climate change, including ocean warming, thermal expansion of water as the ocean warms, and in�lux of water from melting ice sheets and glaciers (Sweet et al., 2022). Localized geologic processes in the Puget Sound region, such vertical land movement, can worsen or slow the effects of sea level rise (Miller et al., 2018). Relative sea levels in Seattle have already risen approximately 0.68 feet, or 8.2 inches, between 1899 and 2022 (Figure 4). During El Niño years, sea levels can rise another 7.9 inches in the region, increasing risks of coastal �looding (Sweet et al., 2022). Climate Change Trends and Projections | 22Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 4. Relative Sea Level Rise in Seattle, WA Notes. Plots show monthly mean sea levels without regular seasonal �luctuations from other atmospheric and oceanographic processes. The relative sea level trend is shown with a 95% con�idence interval. Value measurements are from NOAA Tide Gauge 9447130 in Seattle, WA. Sea levels are projected to rise across Seattle’s shorelines in the coming decades, though sea level rise will be variable due to local geological conditions such as the rate of vertical land movement (Miller et al., 2018). Downscaled sea level rise projections for Washington state use different likelihood scenarios that allow for planners to tailor efforts based on a variety of factors, including planning horizons and risk tolerance (Raymond et al., 2020). For this CVA, we have decided to use the 17 percent and 1 percent likelihood scenarios to illustrate a range of potential impacts associated with sea level rise in alignment with other jurisdictions across Puget Sound (Raymond et al., 2020). By 2050, it is projected that Seattle will experience sea level rise that will exceed 1.1 feet (17% likelihood scenario) to 1.6 feet (1% likelihood scenario) (RCP8.5). By 2100, it is very likely that sea level rise will exceed 3.2 feet (17% likelihood scenario) to 5.2 feet (1% likelihood scenario) (Table 5) Table 5. Relative Sea Level Rise Probabilities in Seattle by 2050 and 2100, under (Roop et al., 2018).

When combined with the 100-year Puget Sound storm surge event, coastal �looding impacts in low-lying areas will be ampli�ied, and sea levels are likely to increase by an additional 3.1 feet (Table 6) (Yang et al., 2019). For example, the December 2022 King Tide �lood events saw �looding reach almost 13 feet in the Duwamish Valley, leading to damaging �loods for Table 6. Projected Sea Level Rise and Storm Surge Impacts under RCP8.5 communities and businesses.

Storm surge events are documented from Petersen et al., 2015. The neighborhoods around the Duwamish River are among the lowest-lying areas in Seattle and are already seeing repeated �looding events. This area is projected to be disproportionately impacted by coastal �looding driven by sea level rise (Figure 5). Additionally, this area has lower conveyance capacity and more impervious surfaces, exacerbating localized �looding impacts (Figure 3). 1 Additional data on coastal �looding and storm surge will be forthcoming in 2024 through the King County Puget Sound CoSMoS project.

Sea Level Rise Along the Duwamish River by 2050 under RCP8.5 Notes: This map shows sea level rise of 3.1 feet (using a 1% likelihood scenario and including storm surge) in the Duwamish Valley of Seattle. There are several blocks along the river shown to be inundated (Miller et al., 2018; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2021; Roop et al., 2018). Extreme Rain and Precipitation Precipitation trends are shifting across Seattle and the Puget Sound region. While annual precipitation will continue to remain variable, there will be seasonal shifts in precipitation. Winter and fall precipitation are expected to increase and precipitation will increasingly fall as rain rather than snow. Additionally, winter precipitation may be concentrated in extreme rain events, which can exacerbate �looding risks. Summer precipitation is projected to decrease across all scenarios, contributing to regional heat stress, drought conditions, and water supply impacts. Climate Change Trends and Projections | 25Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 6. Projected Changes in Seasonal Precipitation for Areas West of the Cascades by the 2080s Notes: Projected changes in seasonal precipitation for the areas in Washington state that are west of the Cascades for the 2080s relative to 1950-1999 for winter (Dec-Feb), spring (Mar-May), summer (Jun-Aug), and fall (Sep-Nov). Projections are shown for CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 models and include low emissions scenarios (SRES B1, RCP4.5, and SSP245) and high emissions scenario (SRES A2, RCP8.5, and SSP585). Individual climate model projections for each scenario are shown th th th using c to hlored Pdoatcsi.� iBco Nxeosr tshhwowes tth Cel aimveartaeg eP rporjoejecctitoedn cThoaonlge (expressed as percent change), along with the 10 , 25 , 75 , and 90 percentile values among all climate model projections. The black horizontal line denotes zero changes. Figure adapted from and created by Cascadia Consulting Group (Rogers & Mauger, 2021). While the magnitude of seasonal shifts in precipitation will vary, summer precipitation is predicted to decrease and winter precipitation is predicted to increase. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, total summer precipitation is projected to decrease by 13 percent by 2050 and 15.9 percent by 2080, and winter precipitation is projected to increase by 7 percent by 2050 and 10.6 percent by 2080. Under the SSP585 scenario, summer precipitation is projected to decrease by 14.2 percent by 2050 and 19.5 percent by 2080, and winter precipitation is set to increase by 5.3 percent by 2050 and 9.8 percent by 2080 (Figure 6) (Morgan et al., 2021). As winter precipitation volume increases, extreme precipitation events – many of which are driven by atmospheric rivers – are likely to be more intense (Slinskey et al., 2020). The magnitude of the average 25 year-storm is expected to increase by 13 percent by 2050 and 12 percent by 2090 (Raymond & Rogers, 2022). In winter months, most extreme precipitation events are driven by atmospheric rivers (Slinskey et al., 2020). When compounded with other events – such as King Tides or storm surge – �looding impacts can Geologic Hazards be ampli�ied. Seattle Municipal Code designates geologic hazards, �lood-prone areas, wetlands and habitat conservation areas, and abandoned land�ills as environmentally critical areas (ECAs). Protecting the functioning and integrity of these ECAs reduces the city’s exposure to geological and �lood hazards and ensures the health of sensitive habitats and the species they support. Climate change can impact these areas directly, and can also act indirectly as a Climate Change Trends and Projections | 26Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment risk multiplier, exacerbating the effects of non-climate related events such as earthquakes aLnAdN DtsSuLnIaDmESis . Landslides are likely to occur in areas with steep slopes, such as in the Delridge and Interbay areas, especially in winter and spring months when heavy precipitation events typically occur (Strauch et al., 2019). Heavy precipitation, particularly over prolonged periods, can contribute to slope instability and failure (Strauch et al., 2018). Events like these will likely increase in frequency and intensity into the future, contributing to increased risks of landslides that cause damage and blockage to transportation routes, buildings, other infrastructure, and natural areas across the city (Figure 7) (Strauch et al., Figure 7. Landslide Hazard Areas in Seattle 2019). Notes: This map shows potential landslide areas in the City of Seattle (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2019). LIQUEFACTION Sea level rise associated with climate change could magnify liquefaction risk during an earthquake (Figure 8). Liquefaction occurs when soil that is saturated with groundwater acts more like a liquid under the intense shaking of an earthquake. As sea level rises along the Seattle shoreline, water tables will also rise, increasing soil saturation and the likelihood and severity of liquefaction (Poitras et al., 2022). Increased urban �looding could especially amplify liquefaction risk during the winter. Conversely, lower water tables during projected temporary drought periods could reduce liquefaction risk during the summer. Climate Change Trends and Projections | 27Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 8. Liquefaction-prone Areas Within Seattle Notes: This map shows liquefaction-prone areas in the City of Seattle (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2019). Extreme Heat Average temperatures in Washington State have already increased 2.0°F over the past century (Frankson et al., 2022). Within the City of Seattle, the average summer (June- August) temperature has already warmed approximately 1.5°F between 1950 and 2020 (University of Washington Of�ice of the Washington State Climatologist, 2021) (Figure 9). Climate Change Trends and Projections | 28Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 9. Average Summer (June-August) Temperature in Seattle from 1950 to 2020 Notes: Average summer temperature data collected by NOAA’s U.S. historical Climatology Network, version 2.5.5.20210712 (University of Washington Of�ice of the Washington State Climatologist, 2021). While temperatures have generally been warming across the city, heat burden is not equally distributed across the city. Factors such as level of industrialization, impervious surface coverage, and tree canopy coverage – all of which are associated with land use and redlining policies – can increase heat burden, or the heat island effect, for some areas of Seattle (Conzelmann et al., 2022). Industrialized areas and historically redlined areas— such as Georgetown and Rainier Beach—can be almost 8°F warmer than other areas (Figure 10). Summertime maximum temperatures in Seattle is projected to increase by 6.3°F by 2050 and 10.5°F by 2100 under RCP8.5 relative to the 1980-2009 median, increasing the frequency of extreme heat days in the city (Raymond & M. Rogers, 2022). Additionally, the likelihood of a heatwave (i.e., when the “feels like” temperature is above 86°F) to last three consecutive days or longer, which is currently about 67 percent, will increase to 86 percent by 2050 (First Street Foundation, n.d.). Due to Seattle’s historically temperate climate, the impacts of warmer temperatures will be relatively more severe for Seattle residents, especially when compared to other cities. Additionally, Seattle has a relatively higher percePnutbagliec oHf ehaoluthse Vhuollndse rwaibthiloituyt taoir C cloimndaitteio Cnhinagn (g4e6%) (American Housing Survey, 2021), making residents vulnerable to heat waves because of the lack of cooling capacity (see section). Climate Change Trends and Projections | 29Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 10. Evening Heat and Heat Islands in Seattle Notes: This map indicates results of a Seattle and King County heat mapping project, which found that urban areas are more prone to higher temperatures than areas with vegetation. SODO and the Industrial District are areas projected to be most impacted by extreme heat (CAPA Strategies et al., 2021). This map illustrates maximum evening temperatures, which typically are a period of the day that allows for cooling from cooler ambient night temperatures, demonstrating how some areas may not get this cooling respite at night. Wildfire Smoke Days Wild�ire smoke is notoriously dif�icult to forecast, but poor air quality days due to wild�ire smoke have been increasing and will become more prevalent and intense due to climate change. In recent decades, wild�ires In Washington state have not only become more prevalent, but their intensity has also increased (Figure 11) (Welty & Jeffries, 2020). Climate Change Trends and Projections | 30Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 11. Number of Large Fires in the Northwest between 1899-2018 Notes: Frequency of large wild�ires (greater than 1,000 acres) and the total area burned in Washington State from 1889 to 2019 (Welty & Jeffries, 2020). Figure created by Cascadia Consulting Group. In 2022, wild�ire smoke days in western Washington extended into October for the �irst time ever (Figure 12). This was primarily due to the warmest and driest September the state had experienced in recent history (Vaughn, 2011). As wild�ires are projected to be more intense, wild�ire smoke days are expected to be more frequent and prolonged, 2.5 increasing PM exposure due to wild�ire smoke, subsequently increasing the risk for smoke-related health-related consequences, particularly for sensitive groups such as elders, youth, low-income communities of color, outside laborers, and people without health insurance. Climate Change Trends and Projections | 31Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 12. Smoke-�illed Days in 2022 Notes: This �igure shows smoke-�illed days across the state of Washington in 2022, on a scale of 0-2 smoke-�illed days to over 36 smoke-�illed days. Seattle appears to have experienced approximately 7-8 smoke-�illed days, but areas directly north of Seattle are darker, indicating more smoke-�illed days in 2022 (Vaughn, 2022). Climate “Surprises” Climate change models have limits in quantifying and predicting some climate change impacts and climate-related extreme events. While climate models provide insight into the range of possible futures, these models are limited by the fact that they do not encapsulate all types of processes, feedback loops, and factors that affect global and local climate. Thus, there are some types of impacts and extreme events that may fall outside the limit of model outputs – or climate “surprises” (Kopp et al., 2017). Some recent examples of “surprises” in Seattle includes the occurrence of wild�ire smoke events each year, the severity of �looding associated with some King Tide events (i.e., 2022 King Tide �lood events), and the 2021 heat dome event that saw temperatures exceed 100°F over multiple consecutive days. Climate Change Trends and Projections | 32Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment Community Amenities and Wellbeing Introduction to Community Amenities and Wellbeing Community wellbeing refers to the variety of social, economic, environmental, cultural, and political conditions identi�ied by community residents that allow their communities and neighborhoods to �lourish and ful�ill their potential (Wiseman & Brasher, 2008). The de�inition of community wellbeing can vary across and within communities, and can be subjective (e.g., how happy does a person feel within their community?) or objective (e.g., does a person or group have access to services and amenities that can allow them to �lourish?) (Atkinson et al., 2017). Proximity and access to amenities have been shown to lead to bene�icial health and wellbeing outcomes, including improved physical and mental health (City of Seattle, 2016). This CVA focuses on community exposure to climate change impacts and how access, or lack of access, to various community amenities and services – such as healthcare services, grocery stores, and shade – will positively or adversely affect local communities in preparing for and coping with the impacts of climate change. Community services and amenities are both at risk from climate change and supportive of communities’ adaptive capacity to prepare for, cope with, and be resilient to climate change. For example, access to amenities and services such as parks and open spaces and grocery stores can provide spaces for recreation and healthy food options, respectively. However, extreme events such as �looding or heat waves can disrupt access or make it more dif�icult for residents to access these services, likely leading to increased burden for those who already have limited access these services (e.g., those without cars, those in sensitive population groups, or older residents). Acute, but prolonged, extreme events that affect amenity access – such as the 2021 heat dome event or the 2022 King Tide �loods – can lead Climate Vulnerability to Community Amenities and Wellbeing to acute illnesses or premature deaths. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS While many factors contribute to community resiliency, the following indicators were selected due to data availability, quality, and relevance (Table 8). While not comprehensive, these indicators illustrate how climate change will affect community resiliency, particularly as it relates to community amenities, services, and wellbeing, and how these impacts are not evenly distributed across the city. Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 33Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Table 7. Community Indicators of Climate Vulnerability Selected for Analysis Indicator Vulnerability Element Relevance & Considerations Climate exposure to Exposure This indicator was chosen to assess exposure to �looding, heat, sea climate change impacts for each census tract. level rise, and urban �looding Food Security and Sensitivity People with lower access to food services – such Access as grocery stores or restaurants – are more sensitive to impacts of climate change due to further distance to access food and a decreased ability to quickly access food amenities and stores. Access to Parks Sensitivity People with lower access to parks and green spaces, particularly those that rely on these spaces to improve mental and physical health, are more sensitive to the impacts of climate change. Race & Social Equity Sensitivity Race and social equity considerations – such as Index health and socioeconomic disadvantages – increase vulnerability and risk to climate impacts and how a community adapts and copes before, during, and after these events. Tree Canopy Adaptive Capacity Lack of tree canopy coverage increases the relative vulnerability and risk of heat-related impacts for the residents and workers that reside in these areas Critical Facilities Adaptive Capacity People who have less access and are further from critical facilities – or facilities that provide important community services – increase vulnerability for frontline communities to access these services during extreme weather events. Climate impacts – such as extreme heat and urban �looding – will disrupt access and level of service for a variety of community amenities, including parks and open spaces, grocery stores, and critical facilities. These disruptions often exacerbate existing health and socioeconomic disparities and affect the ability of residents to respond and recover from climate impacts and extreme events. Some areas in Seattle will experience more community vulnerability to climate change, such as the Duwamish Valley, SODO, Rainier Valley, Lake City, Northgate, and Bitter Lake (Figure 13). Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 34Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 13. Map of Community Vulnerability to Climate Change at the Census Tract Level Notes: This index map of community vulnerability to climate change shows darker areas with higher vulnerability and lighter areas with lower vulnerability. The darkest areas are in SODO, the International District, South Park, Lower Duwamish, and Rainier Beach (City of Seattle, 2022). COMMUNITY RESILIENCE IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE Duwamish Valley, Georgetown, and Rainier Valley Community vulnerability to climate change will not be distributed across the city equally. Generally, the are relatively more vulnerable to climate change’s impacts on community resiliency. The following sections detail the various community resilience implications of climate change for the city and its nPaerigksh,b Ooprehno oSpdasc. es, and Tree Canopy Urban TSeraetet lCea’sn poapryk sa, nodp eOnp sepna cSepsa, caensd tree canopy have played an outsized role in making the city safe and more livable for communities by improving health and wellbeing (see section) (Seattle Parks and Recreation, 2022). Parks and urban forests are particularly important for communities without air conditioning because they provide heat refuge and no-cost shaded spaces. Many parks also have drinking fountains, which provide access to clean water for a variety of users, including children and people who are houseless. Urban forests can also improve local air quality, as they can Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 35Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment uptake and remove a variety of air pollutants. Finally, parks and urban forests can increase bene�icial mental health outcomes – such as reducing stress and anxiety, increasing happiness, and improving cognitive function (Bratman et al., 2019). While these amenities strengthen community resilience, impacts to these resources will also have outsized impacts on communities that may have less access to these amenities in the �irst place. Climate impacts to parks and urban forests can compound existing vulnerabilities to climate change for surrounding communities. Impacts such as �looding or heatwaves can limit access to parks, undercutting City efforts to make parks more accessible and improve community wellbeing. Disruption to park and urban forest access – even for a limited time – can contribute to an acute decrease in community wellbeing if residents are unable to access key features and amenities and potentially contribute to an overall decrease in community wellbeing, especially if there is associated post-trauma lower Duwamish Valley stress after extreme events. Rainier Valley In particular, the (i.e., Georgetown, South Park and SODO) and areas will have higher relative vulnerability due to lack of access to parks and open spaces and relatively lower tree canopy coverage than other parts of the city (Figure 13). The lack of robust tree canopy coverage increases the risk of heat-related impacts – such as heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and mortality – for the people who reside or work in these areas (Isaksen et al., 2014; Schramm et al., 2020). As urban forests are stressed due to heat, low water availability, and development, park access and urban tree health are expected to worsen, potentially exacerbating health disparities. Additionally, many of these neighborhoods are considered higher equity priority areas, which means that a relatively large portion of their population are BIPOC, have socioeconomic disadvantages (e.g., low income, no college degree), or have higher rates of health challenges (e.g., higher rate of asthma) (City of Seattle Of�ice of Planning & Community Development., 2021). These same factors that already make these neighborhoods higher priority areas also make these neighborhoods more sensitive to the impacts of extreme heat. Furthermore, many of these neighborhoods that have less tree canopy coverage, access to parks, and experience more extreme urban heat island effects are areas that have been historically redlined (Hoffman et al., 2020). Areas t°hat received 2 Home Owners’ Loan Corporation grades of C or D – such as the Duwamish Valley area, Rainier Beach, Central District – have average temperatures that are 3.6-4.0 F warmer than the rest of the city (Figure 14). Additionally, households in these areas are more likely to have limited or no access to personal vehicles, compounding disparities in ability to access amenities and services like parks and health care. 2 The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) was created during the New Deal Era and created a neighborhood ranking system, now known as “redlining”. Deve lopers and appraisers assigned grades that ranger from A to D, where A grades were considered “best”, and C and D grades were considered “declining” or “hazardous”. Generally, neighborhoods with C and D grades – now referenced as formerly redlined neighborhoods – received these grades because of they had higher proportions of Jewish, Asian, Latino/x, and Black families. Because of these grades, many cities diverted public investments – such as quality schools, grocery stores, health care facilities, parks, among others – away from these neighborhoods and sited facilities – such as industrial facilities – within or near these neighborhoods. Disparities in health outcomes and wealth accumulation of residents in formerly redlined neighborhoods are associated with these historical policies and decisions. Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 36Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 14. Redlining and Exposure to Urban Heat Islands in Seattle Notes: Red areas indicate temperatures that are warmer than the citywide average. Blue areas indicate temperatures cooler than the citywide average (Hoffman et al., 2020). Parks and open spaces located along the Duwamish River and within the 100-and 500-year �loodplain will have an increased potential for �looding from future sea level rise. For example, the con�luence of heavy precipitation and a King Tide event brought the worst �looding that Seattle’s South Park neighborhoodC haassc saedeinn gin a yneda rCso, mwiptho u�lnododiningg I manpda cts damage to at least 13 homes and the Duwamish Waterway Park and disrupted access to community amenities and critical facilities (see ) (Daisy Zavala Magaña, 2022). Repeated or extensive �looding events can increase the spread of water-borne diseases such as Shigellosis and worsen some environmental health impacts, such as from the prevalence of mold in housing structures (May et al., 2018). Impacts from water-borne diseases will Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 37Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment disproportionately affect people who are houseless and people who are low-income and living in older housing structures. The City of Seattle anticipates increased use of parks and open spaces (e.g., pools, beaches, community centers) during heat events, particularly in Equity & Environment Initiative (EEI) focus areas (Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability and Environment, 2017). Reducing climate risks to parks and urban forests – such as through investments in conservation and restoration, maintenance of tree canopy, and planting of heat-tolerant plants and trees – will simultaneously increase the adaptive capacity of parks and open spaces and the resiliency of the surrounding communities dependent on them (Seattle Parks and RCreictirceaal tFiaocni,l i2ti0es2 2 ). Critical facilities – which include public and private facilities such as hospitals, clinics, �ire stations, police stations, and grocery stores – are essential for the delivery of vital services for a community’s function and protection. As climate impacts such as �looding become more frequent and intense, there will likely be disruptions and damage to critical facilities that decrease the ability of some frontline communities to access these services during extreme events –P udbislpicr oHpeoarlttihonately affecting some groups such as people without acce ss to a car, people with mobility issues, older residents, or people with chronic health conditions (see section) (SAMHSA, 2017). People in this sensitive groupmay also have dif�iculty quickly evacuating during emergencies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2016). Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 38Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 15. Critical Facilities, Flooding and Sea Level Rise Notes: Some critical facilities, especially in the Duwamish and Montlake areas, will be affected by �looding and sea level rise (City of Seattle, 2022; Miller et al., 2018; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2021; Roop et al., 2018). Some critical facilities will be impacted by �looding and sea level rise (Figure 15). The following table notes critical facilities that are located within the 100-year �loodplain and SLR zones (Table 9).

Food security means that an individual or community has the resources necessary to acquire food, which includes affordable food prices and proximity to food amenities and retail outlets. Food access can increase the adaptive capacity and resilience of communities to extreme events; however, impacts from climate change can also exacerbate food access inequities, increasing the vulnerability of communities with less access to food or that are more cost burdened. Based on a survey conducted by Puget Sound Sage, limited access to healthy and affordable food is a top climate change-related concern for communities along the Duwamish River (i.e., South Park) and Rainier Valley (Sage, 2020). As of 2020, approximately 60 percent of housing units in Seattle are within a half miWlee osft a S geraotctelery Dstuowrea (mSeiastht lVea Ollfe�iyce of Planning Ranadin Cieorm Bmeuancihty Development, 2020). However, some neighborhoods lack grocery stores within a half mile, including areas in , the , and parts of that have over a third of their households living more than 0.5 miles away from the closest grocery store(Figure 13). Additionally, a community’s social and cultural norms can inform food access and distribution channels. For example, communities with P-Patches can provide a space to grow fresh and healthy foods for surrounding households. Cultural gardens, like the Yes Farm or the Danny Woo International District Community Garden, aim to empower speci�ic groups, like the Black community or the Asian and Paci�ic Islander communities, to steward and connect residents to culturally relevant food systems (City of Seattle, 2023). Other Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 40Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment groups, such as urban Native residents or immigrants and refugees, may rely on subsistence methods, such as harvesting or �ishing, within or around the city (City of Seattle, 2023). Flooding and extreme events are projected to be more frequent and intense, which will affect food access across the city, particularly in the Duwamish Valley area, where there is a lower median household income, poorer air quality and associated health outcomes, and more children who require nutritious foods for their growth and development (City of Seattle, 2016). These events can exacerbate existing food access inequities for these neighborhoods. For example, �lood events can disrupt access to local grocery stores by reducing transit options for residents and affect the hours of local food businesses, placing additional burden on households with limited access to personal cars or residents that walk or bike to stores. Additionally, coastal �looding impacts can affect the access of harvesting and gathering sites of residents reliant on subsistence foods (Figure 13). The City has many ongoing programs and community-led efforts that address gaps in access to food retailers that promote affordability, individual and cultural preferences, and food quality and variety (City of Seattle, 2016). For example, the City supports emerging local businesses to �ill the healthy food gap by connecting them to City resources and implements alternative efforts to �ill the healthy food gap, such as establishing a farmers’ mEacrkoet inn Sooumth Piacrk. Vulnerability to Climate Change Introduction to Local Economy While economic activity contributes to climate change, climate change also affects the economy – both at micro and macro scales. Climate change is expected to have direct and consequential effects across the regional economy, particularly for natural resource economies and outdoor-based industries (Lee et al., 2023). Climate change and extreme events can directly affect crops, infrastructure, and labor through increased exposure to various climate-related hazards. These direct effects will have indirect impacts across economic systems. For example, impacts to local produce may lead to reduced revenue for agricultural producers; lost labor hours due to extreme event may lead to less spending power within the community; or repeated exposure to �looding for homes and businesses can lead to increase in insurance premiums or affect property values (Lee et al., 2023). Furthermore, a strong local economy also depends on things indirectly affectCeodm bym culinmitayte cAhmanegneit, iiensc launddin Wg ceollmbmeiunngi ty amenities that support a thriving local workforce, such as affordable cost of living, parks and open spaces, and good quality of life (see section). Seattle’s economy is characterized by a mix of industries, including industries that are part of Seattle’s history – such as timber, maritime, and �ishing – along with new types of industries such as technology companies, start-ups, retail, construction, and health sciences. While many large companies have headquarters in Seattle, the city has a strong ethos of supporting local businesses. Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 41Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment While the city has a strong economy, many workers reside outside of the city and many residents commute to work outside of the city, such as to Bellevue, Redmond, Everett, and SeaTac. Additionally, the Port of Seattle acts as an important hub for regional, national, and international commerce, serving as an important hub for commercial �ishing industries, tourism, and a part of many different supply chains. The city also has relatively low unemployment rates compared to the rest of Washington state and the U.S., and average wages in Seattle are relatively higher than average wages in the country (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023). However, like many other urban areas, the city of Seattle’s wealth and economic assets are inequitably distributed, and communities that were historically redlined and BIPOC residents generally have relatively less income, accumulated wealth, and higher unemployment rates (Oliver & Shapiro, 2019). In Seattle, climate change is likely to have both direct and indirect effects on the local economy, affecting land use and availability, transportation routes (both commercial and commuting), utilities and associated costs, natural resource commodities, and public health. These impacts will affect Seattle’s economy in a myriad of ways. Some businesses will be damaged or forced to close during extreme weather events or will suffer reduced foot traf�ic due to disruption of transit and walking routes. Extreme heat events will result in lost labor hours across the city, with consequences for businesses and for workers’ wages. Storms, heat, and �looding will likely disrupt transportation systems, with repercussions for both employees’ commutes and business supply chains. Business’ costs will increase – whether due to scarce materials, rising insurance costs, or higher energy demand for cooling. Workers in some occupations, such as construction, will be particularly exposed to extreme weather and will likely experience negative physical and mental health outcomes. Across the city, communities have unequal access to jobs, education, and new Climate Vulnerability to the Local Economy opportunities in the face of disrupted employment.

ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE Duwamish, SODO, Georgetown, Rainier Valley, Downtown South ELacokneo Umniico vnulnerability from climate change will not be distributed across the city equally. Generally, the , and neighborhoods have higher economic vulnerability to climate change than other neighborhoods in Seattle. The following sections unpack the various economic iWmoprklifcoarctieo Inms poafc ctlsi mduaet eto c hExatnregme efo Wr ethaeth ceirt y, and how vulnerability is distributed. Climate change has affected and will affect Seattle’s workforce in multiple ways. Over the past 30 years, workers in these climate-exposed industries have made up 4.5 percent to 5.6 percent of all workers in King County, representing 5.4 percent of workers in 2022 (United States Census Bureau, 2022). In 2019, there were approximately 25,851 workers who worked in climate-exposed industries – such as natural resource industries (e.g., agriculture, forestry, �ishing, and hunting) and outdoor-based industries like construction – in the city, encompassing 4.4 percent of the regional labor force (Table 11). These Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 44Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment industries are considered to be climate-exposed because the industries themselves provide goods and/or services that will be directly affected by climate change (e.g., natural resources) or the workers will be occupationally exposed to climate change because of the outdoor nature of their work (Got Green & Puget Sound Sage, 2016; Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability and Environment, 2017). During extreme anomaly events—such as the 2021 Heat Dome event—workers who we2r0e 2n1o tH ine actli Dmoamtee-e Expveonsetd industries, such as service workers or �irst emergency responders, were also affected by business closures or responding to emergency calls (see section). Thus, estimates of lost labor hours likely underestimate the true cost of climate impacts on the workforce. Extreme heat and other climate-related hazards will result in lost wages for climate- exposed workers.With 2°F of additional warming relative to the 1986-2005 average, which is expected by the 2050s under the RCP8.5 scenario, the city will see approximately 25,851 lost labor hours, or the equivalent of $595,090 (2017 dollars) in lost wages per year, due to 3 extreme heat for climate-exposed occupations. Any impacts to local wages – whether acute or chronic – will decrease the spending power of households, affecting potential market demand for goods and services provided by local businesses. Additionally, increased ambient temperatures are correlated with additional workplace injuries, (Page & Sheppard, 2016) and communities with more residents who work in outdoor occupations—such as areas like RainierP Vuabllleicy ,H Heiaghltlhine, Duwamish Valley, and Georgetown areas—have higher rates of heat-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits than other communities (see section) (Riley et al., 2018). As a result, workers in climate-exposed workers may experience additional healthcare cost burdens to cope with occupational heat-related injuries in addition to losing wages Table 10.

All commuters are likely to experience some kind of impact due to extreme weather; those most at risk of negative health impacts will be those who walk, bike, and use transit to get to work. In particular, there is a large commuter base concentrated in the Downtown and University District areas (Figure 17) Before the COVID- 19 pandemic, over one third of workers in Seattle traveled to get to work using transit (20.5%), walking (10.8%), or another method (4.7%) such as biking. Half (50%) of Seattle Figure 17. Map of Seattle Workers Who Use Transit, Walking, or Other Non-vehicle workers drove or carpooled to work, and the rest worked from home. Commute Modes Notes: This map shows concentrations of Seattle residents who take non-vehicle transportation modes to work, including working from home. Areas in central Seattle and near the University of Washington show the highest concentrations of non-vehicle commuters (Puget Sound Regional Council, 2021). Climate Risks to Small Businesses in Seattle Small businesses are an important part of the economic fabric of Seattle and are more vulnerable to climate change impacts than larger businesses. They generally have fewer resources (e.g., staff, �inancial resources, insurance coverage) than larger businesses to withstand climate-related disruptions, including closures during extreme weather events or impacts to staff (e.g., weather-related injuries, disruptions to commute routes) that result in acute or chronic absences. They also have increased �inancial burdens to cover costs for insurance, energy usage, and materials, and generally are less resilient to Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 46Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment withstand economic shocks (Sadeghi, 2022). For example, during the 2021 heat dome event, many businessCeass hcaadd itnog s hauntd d Coowmnp douuen tdoi unngp Crleicmedaeten tIemdp haecatts, putting an acute strain on local businesses who were already trying to recover from economic disruptions from COVID-19 (see section).

These businesses are at risk of not only impacts from extreme heat, which are captured in the economic vulnerabDiuliwtya imndiesxh, Vbaultl ealyso impGaecotrsg ferotomw �nlooding due to the amounts of impervious surfaces and proximity to the waterfront. Additionally, businesses in some areas, such as the and , will likely experience damage from �looding associated with extreme precipitation and sea level rise, affecting customer visitation rates and local commerce, such as the disruption experienced during the 2022 King Tide �lood event (Sadeghi, 2022). Insurance coverage for these businesses in high-risk areas such as the 100-year �loodplain may increase, placing additional cost burden on small businesses in these areas. Finally, small businesses may be disproportionately affected by climate risks within the energy sector. The commercial sector accounts for more than half oEfn eelergctyr iScyitsyt eumses in Seattle (56%, compared to 10% industrial and 34% residential) (Raymond, 2013). As energy systems become more strained due to climate change (see section), there may be additional burden on some small bu sinesses that may experience brown outs or demand-driven energy price increases (Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability and ESunpvpirlyo nCmhaeinn tD, i2sr0u1p7ti,o Gnost Green & Puget Sound Sage, 2016). Seattle is a central commerce hub that is critical to multiple supply chains and industries. Damage to key transportation assets such as port facilities and rail infrastructure from �looding, storms, and increased rates of degradation due to extreme heat will likely impact supply chains for local, regional, and international commerce (Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability and Environment, 2017). Impacts to commodities such as agricultural products and �isheries, cCaonm amffeucnt irteyg Aiomnaeln foitoieds supply, restaurant operations, and reliability of grocery stores to stock fresh and local produce (May et al., 2018), potentially affecting local food security (see section).

However, emerging research indicates that climate change may affect • home ownership in multiple ways (Becketti, 2021). These include: Decreasing home values for housing structures in at-risk areas, such as the 100-year or 500-year �loodplain. Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 47Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment • • Increasing the physical risks to housing structures from �looding, extreme rain, wild�ire smoke, and extreme heat, affecting costs to fortify or repair homes for homeowners.

These health disparities have resulted from a variety of factors, including access to care, socioeconomic conditions, environmental conditions, linguistic barriers, and historical policies such as redlining. Climate change will affect public health in a myriad of ways, such as exacerbating existing public health risks and introducing new types of health consequences for residents. For example, extreme heat events have led to increases in hospital room visits in King County and Seattle (Isaksen et al., 2014, 2016). More frequent wild�ire smoke events are 2.5 decreasing local air quality and increasing PM exposure for residents, leading to more physical health consequences such as asthma incidences and cardiovascular injuries. Allergy seasons are starting earlier and extending for longer due to warmer spring temperatures. Vector-borne diseases – such as West Nile virus – are also becoming more prevalent. Emerging research is beginning to document additional mental health consequences of climate change, such as increased stress from extreme events or increased anxiety, especially in youth, from learning and experiencing the negative impacts of climate Climate Vulnerability to Public Health change. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS There are many factors that affect health risks and vulnerability to climate change, including climate projections on future health impacts, social determinants of health, and access to health care services.

Map of Public Health Vulnerability to Climate Change Notes: This index map of public health vulnerability to climate change shows darker areas with higher vulnerability and lighter areas with lower vulnerability. The darkest areas are in South Park and Rainier Beach (City of Seattle, 2022). PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE Public health impacts due to climate change are not felt equally across communities and are likely to be disproportionately felt by certain populations, such as people with chronic physical or mental health conditions, older residents, low-income households, renters, people living in older housing structures, and youth. Systemic and institutional racism – such as policies of redlining and siting of industrial facilities – has resulted in increased sensitivity and more limitDedu wadaamptiisvhe VcaapllaecyityIn atmeronnagt isoonciaall lDy iasntrdi cetc/oCnhoimnaictaolwlyn vulnerable Rpoapinuileatri oVnasll (eGyee & Ford, 2011). Areas with the highest relative health vulnerability to climate change are in the , , and communities, where there are relatively more low-income and more ethnically diverse populations (Figure 18). These are the same areas tChoamt amlsuon hiatyv e rAemlaetinvietliye lse assn dac Wceeslsl btoe icnogmmunity amenities and services – such as health care and grocery stores – that contribute to underlying health disparities (see section). Communities living in �loodplains, areas with poor air quality, or landslide and wild�ire prone areas will likely experience increased exposure to climate-related hazards. Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 50Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Additionally, outdoor workeErcso (neo.gm., cico nVsutlrnuecrtiaobni lwitoyr kers, urban farmers) will experience increased occupational exposure to certain impacts, such as extreme heat, affecting their hPehyaslticha al nHde alilvthe l ihoods (see section). Physical health will be affected in multiple ways due to climate change. Heat-related injuries and deaths are expected to increase across all climate scenarios. Increases in wild�ire smoke will affect respiratory-related illnesses. Environmental health challenges – such as presence of mold – will worsen as �looding events become more severe and Extreme Heat frequent. Vector-borne diseases are expected to become more prevalent. Extreme heat accounts for more deaths annually than any other single weather event- related hazard in the Paci�ic Northwest (Isaksen et al., 2016; US Department of Homeland SecurEixtyt,r 2e0m2e2 )H. eSautmmertime maximum temperatures in Seattle will continue to increase by 6.3°F by 2050 and 10.5°F by 2100 under RCP8.5 scenario (Raymond & Rogers, 2022) (see section). King County already experiences an in�lux of emergency room visits and heat-related mortality during hot days and mortality is expected to increase for everyone in Seattle, (Isaksen et al., 2016). For every 1°F of warming, heat-related mortality in King County is expected to increase an average of 1.83 percent for all age groups. However, older adults will be disproportionately affected, as their heat-related mortality is expected to increase from 2.3 to 22.3 times the average (Isaksen et al., 2014). In addition to older adults, groups such as people with chronic medical conditions – such as cardiovascular, cerebral, or respiratory diseases – and children under the age of �ive are more sensitive to heat exposure, even for short periods (Antonia et al., 2018). Residents who live in older housing structures are also more sensitive to extreme heat, as older housing units are likely to have less insulation that lets in the hot ambient air while preventing retention of any cool air indoors. Additionally, types of outdoor workers – such as construction, agriculture, and emergency response – that are considered “climate- exposed” are more likely to experience health impacts from occupational exposure to hazards such as extreme heat, wild�ire smoke, �looding, and poor quality. Heat-related fatigue can affect cognitive decision-making capabilities andE choenato-rmeliact Vedu linnejurraibesil ictayn stress worker livelihood due to lost labor hours and wages. Heat-related injuries can also induce �inancial stress and anxiety from costs of medical care (see section). Furthermore, some of these jobs may be contract workers, so workers may not International District, SODO Lower Duwamish have employer-subsidized health insurance as a safety net in case medical care is required. Within Seattle, the area, and (i.e., South Park, Georgetown) areas are likely to experience hotter temperatures due to the heat island effect, a phenomenon that occurs in urban aCreoams mduuen tioty h Aigmheern pitrieevsa alenndc eW oef lilmbepienrgvious or hard surfaces like parking lots, rooftops, and roads that absorb heat and less tree canopy coverage for shade and cooling respite (see section) (Hsu et al., 2021). Additionally, many of Seattle’s major transit systems – such as I- 5, State Routes 99 and 509, East Marginal Way, railroads, and the Boeing Airport Field – run Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 51Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment through the SODO area, Georgetown, and South Park neighborhoods, creating more impervious surfaces and less tree canopy coverage. Approximately 46 percent of Seattle’s households do not have access to air conditioning, suggesting that Seattle residents are not as prepared to cope with heatwaves than other cities’ residents. While air conditioning and cooling capacity has increased across the city since the 2021 heat dome event, some groups such as renters, low-income households, and people who live in older housing units that may have structural challenges for air conditioning retro�its, do not have equal capacity to install air conditioning. The City of Seattle is continuing to invest in and improve access to cooling centers across the city, Smoke and Air Quality which can help some residents cope with extreme heat events. 2.5 As temperatures increase across the region, the risk of PM exposure will increase due to air quality impacts and wild�ire smoke events. Hotter temperatures will likely in�luence humidity, precipitation, and wind patterns, resulting in increases of secondary formation of 2.5 2.5 ground-level ozone and PM (Fann et al., 2021). Exposure to PM and ground-level ozone can result in increased hospitalizations, emergency room visits, absences from school or work, and restricted activity days. Those with chronic heart or lung disease, older people, Table 12. Average Excess Cases per 100,000 Persons for Various Health Outcomes and children will be particularly sensitive to these impacts.

SV. aElnlevyironmental Protection Agency, 2021). Some communities across Seattle – such as those in the and – already have relatively higher asthma rates and air quality-climate interactions will affect these communities more than others (Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability and Environment, 2017). Some of these neighborhoods, such as Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 52Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment SODO, South Park, and Rainier Valley, are close to major highways such as I-5 and I-90 that 2.5 can contribute to elevated PM from car traf�ic in these areas. These areas can have compounding air quality impacts during wild�ire smoke events and are projected to have relatively more new asthma incidences (up to an additional 38 asthma incidences out of 100,000 people) attributed to climate change (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Vector-Borne Diseases and Environmental Health 2021). Some environmental health hazards, such as mold, are expected to become more common as �looding becomes more frequent, leading to health impacts such as aggravation of asthma or other respiratory-illnesses, allergy symptoms, rashes, and infections (Paudel et al., 2021). Additionally, a variety of other vector- and water-borne diseases areE e. cxopleicted to increase in the Paci�ic Northwest due to warmer weather and extreme precipitation, including Lyme diseases, West Nile virus, cryptococcal infections, Salmonella, , and Shigellosis, among others. Some of these diseases – such as Shigellosis – will disproportionately affect people who are houseless (May et al., 2018). FinallyC, osmommeu fnooitdys tAhmate rneistiideesn atns dh aWrveelslbt e–i snugch as shell�ish – can accumulate additional toxins associated with harmful algal blooms, leading to illnesses for those who consume them (see Mental Health section). There is an emerging body of peer-reviewed evidence that establishes the connections between climate change and mental health outcomes. There is consensus that exposure to changing climate conditions and extreme weather events can add to mental distress and worsen a variety of mental health illnesses such a s stress, anxiety, depression, post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in substance use and domestic violence (Crimmins et al., 2016). Additionally, income lossassociated with climate-related extreme events – such as those experienced when some industries had to shut down during the 2021 heat dome event or small businEecsosneos mafifce cVtuedln beyr athbeil 2it0y22 King Tide �looding in South Park – can negatively affect mental health of people who are outside laborers or small business owners or employees (see section). Children, older adults, people with chronic mental illness, immigrants, refugees, people who are houseless, and those who are low-income are more likely to be psychologically vulnerable to extreme events. Duwamish Valley, International District/Chinatown, Rainier Valley, and Lake City Neighborhoods that have relatively higher health vulnerability to climate change are the . These areas will likely bedisproportionately affected by, and less resilient to, the psychological risks assCoocmiamtedu nwitityh A cmlimenatieti-eresl aatnedd Whaezlalbrdesin (gFigure 18). Generally, these communities have less access to amenities that can confer positive mental and community health outcomes (see section). Additionally, these areas also have higher relative rates of older residents, who can be socially isolated, and higher rates of people without health insurance coverage, which may prevent residents from attaining mental health services. Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 53Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Across the U.S., each degree of warming will lead to an increase in suicide rates, and the Paci�ic Northwest is expected to experience a higher suicide burden relative to the rest of the U.S. with each degree of warming (Belova et al., 2022). Access to parks and open spaces has been shown to have positive mental health bene�its by providing opportunities for people to de-stress with physical recreational activity and enjoy green spaces, which can increase happiness (Bratman et al., 2019; Crimmins et al., 2016). However, park access is inequitable across Seattle. For example, while the Duwamish Valley has access to parks, those parks are about half the size of the average City park and are harder to access due to reduced transit infrastructure (e.g., walkable sidewalks, bus routes) (City of Seattle, 2016). Social cohesion can improve a community’s adaptive capacity, as more connected and socially cohesive communities often fare better during and after natural disasters; more speci�ically, social cohesion can improve cooperation, which can increase the resilience immediately after natural disasters (Cherng et al., 2019). Despite high exposure and sensitivity to public health impacts of climate change, neighborhoods such as the Duwamish and Rainier Valley areas also have a strong history of social and civic organization that can facilitate community and social cohesion, increasing their resilience. Quantifying social cohesion is particularly dif�icult, and thus not we have not included social cohesion as a quantitative indicator in this assessment. However, these areas are also experiencing relatively higher rates of cost-of-living increases and associated gentri�ication iSmocpiaacl tSsa, fwethyi Nche tc: aEnm aefrfgeecnt ctyh eRiers spoocnisael caonhd eHseioanlt h(cRaircee et al., 2020; Weems, 2016). Critical facilities play a crucial role in delivering vital services to the community. They include facilities such as hospitals and �ire stations. They alsoC ionmclumdue nfaitcyil iAtimese snuictihe as sa nd lWiberlalrbieesin, sgchools, community centers, and grocery stores that provide necessary services – such as cooling centers or food – during extreme events (see section). Climate change and extreme events will affect access to these facilities in multiple ways. For example, urban or coastal �looding can lead to road closures or increase traf�ic congestion, impacts to energy systems can lead to more frequent outages or damage to energy infrastructure, and emergency services can be strained during extreme events. Disruptions and diminished access to these services can increase the risk of negative health impacts to the surrounding communities, leading to acute and chronic stress on health systems and the social safety net (May et al., 2018). ISnoaudtehq Puaartek h ealth care coverage is one of the largest barriers to health care access, which contributes to health disparities (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services., 2022). has the highest uninsurance rates compared to other areas in the city, with 17 percent of residents without health insurance. Uninsured adults are less likely to receive care for chronic conditions such as diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases, while uninsured children are less likely to receive preventative care for conditions such as asthma (Michael McWilliams, 2009). Limited availability and access to healthcare services will likely increase the risk of residents to experience negative health outcomes associated with extreme heat and poor quality, which lowers their ability to adapt and recover before, during, and after these events. Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 54Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment While outside the geographic scope of this CVA, there may also be spillover impacts to other regions. For example, Seattle has the largest concentration of medical facilities and the only Level 1 trauma center in the broader four-state region (WA, ID, MT, and AK) of the Great Northwest. Thus, acute health impacts from extreme events – such as those experienced during the heat dome event – will have cascading impacts for level of service for emergency medical response to other regions. Social and Economic Climate Vulnerability Assessment | 55Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Physical Vulnerability Assessment Infrastructure Vulnerability to Climate Change Infrastructure systems are inherently interdependent and connected, and climate impacts and risks in one system will inevitably have cascading impacts to other infrastructure systems (Figure 19). For example, impacts to snowpack will affect the reliability of hydroelectric power sources throughout the summer and fall, potentially jeopardizing the energy supply for cooling needs during heatwaves, when energy demand is higher for cooling (May et al., 2018; Raymond, 2013). This also presents tradeoffs for climate mitigation and adaptation investments. For example, investments to electrify transportation systems may reduce the resiliency of energy systems as it needs to balance electri�icatioPnu nbeliecd Hs eaanldt hother Cenoemrgmyu dneimtya Andmse. Inmitpieacst as ntod iWnferallsbteruinctgure systems will also disrupt the delivery of critical services, which are especially important during extreme events (see and sections). To assess the climate vulnerability to Seattle’s infrastructure systems, the project team • Energy infrastructure systems considered the risk of the following systems to different climate impacts: • Transportation infrastructure systems , including transmission lines and substations. • Water, sewer, and stormwater infrastru, cintucrlued siynsgt beumss, streetcar, commuter rail routes, bridges, rail lines, ports and ferry terminals, and airports. , including the Carkeek Park Sewage Treatment Plant, the West Point Wastewater Treatment Plant, pump stations, wastewater detention, reservoirs, and mainlines. Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 56Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 19. Climate Stressors Affect Infrastructure Systems Notes: This �igure depicts climate-related impacts and the types of infrastructure each one is likely to affect. Most climate- related impacts will have effects on multiple types of infrastructure, and most types of infrastructure will be impacted by multiple climate hazards (May et al., 2018). Energy Infrastructure Systems Seattle City Light (SCL) provides electricity to the city, and its energy system is comprised of components such as power stations that produce electricity, transformers that convert electricity from high voltage to low voltage, and transmission and power lines, and substations, which distribute it to residential homes and commercial facilities. Every component of the energy system will be affected by climate change, and due to their interconnectedness, disruptions in one system can lead to disruptions and delays in other parts of the system. • Energy supply disruptions Seattle’s energy system will be affected in a myriad of ways by climate change, including: , particularly in the summer months. While Seattle currently has suf�icient supply to meet current energy demands in the summReerg, ional Wdeactreerasshede dssnowpack and more intense and prolonged droughts are affecting the seasonal water supply and future reliability of hydropower operations (see section) (Wood, 2015). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 57Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment • Electricity transmission damage and interruptions from extreme events, such as winter storms, atmospheric rivers, and heatwaves, can damage transmission lines or decrease the carrying capacity of transmissions lines (Zamuda et al., 2018). • AEndderitgioyn daellmy, awnadr minecrr teeamsepseratures and extreme heat days can overheat the substations across the city, potentially affecting energy distribution. , especially in summer months as air conditioning and cooling capacity increases across the city. While the city of Seattle currently sees increased demand in winter months for heating needs and electri�ication of heating systems, air conditioning and HVAC adoption is increasing across residential and commercial structures. This transition may cause an increase in energy demand for cooling during the summer. While anticipated energy supply is expected to meet expected increases in energy demand in the summer months, extreme events such as heatwaves can cause brownouts due to acute energy shortfalls or prolonged power outages from impacts to transmission and distribution systems (Zamuda et al., 2018). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 58Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 20. Substations and Transmission Lines in Seattle Notes: This map shows energy infrastructure (15 substations and several transmission lines) in and immediately outside the city of Seattle (City of Seattle, 2022; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2020). ENERGY SUPPLY Generally, Seattle’s energy generation has moderate vulnerability to climate change . The majority of SCL’s generation comes from hydropower, with approximately 80 to 90 percent of Seattle’s electricity being derived from seven hydroelectric sources (Seattle City Light, 2022). Hydropower supply is dependent on several watersheds – such as the Cedar and Tolt watersheds – in the region. The Cedar River and the Tolt rely on runoff from the Cascade mountains, which historically has experienced a decrease in its snowpack ranging Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 59Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Regional Watersheds from 15 percent to 35 percent relative to 1930 to 1970, and these trends are projected to worsen by the 2080s (see section) (Snover et al., 2013). Shifts in winter precipitation will affect �low volume and timing, as peak �lows are expected to increase in winter months and decrease in summer months, where energy demand is growing (Mauger & Won, 2020). Despite these impacts, Seattle’s hydropower supply is generally resilient to changes in snowpack and peak �lows due to water storage management that can manage �lows to hydroelectric facilities, the diversity and redundancy of SCL hydroelectric facilities, and the ability to offset electricity shortfalls with purchases from other utilities, such as the Bonneville Power Administration and BC Hydro (Raymond, 2013). While the city’s hydroelectric sources are generally resilient, extreme droughts can affect the water supply and energy reliability for the entire state (Turner et al., 2022) (Figure 21). While historic droughts have yet to affect energy reliability for the state, repeated and prolonged droughts that extend across the state have the potential to affect seasonal rFeigliuabreil i2ty1 .o Af hssyodcroiaetlieocntrsi cB peotwweere. n Hydropower Generation and Droughts in Washington State from 1990-2021 Notes: Annual hydroelectric generation in Washington State between 1990 and 2021 (EIA, 2022).

ENERGY TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION Seattle’s energy transmission and distribution systems have a low vulnerability to climate change Generally, . The transmission and distribution system deliver energy Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 60Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment to over 400,000 residential and commercial customers in Seattle (Seattle City Light, 2022). Underground and overhead transmission wires can be weakened or damaged and experience operational issues if inundated (Energy Networks Association, 2018). Additionally, overhead transmission and distribution lines can be damages during winter storms, where high winds can cause tree falls that damage overhead lines. Flooding can also lead to high voltage equipment damage, de-energization, �ire, or catastrophic loss of substation equipment. While no substations are in the 100- or 500- year �loodplain or are exposed to 2050 sea level rise impacts (RCP8.5), some substations in low elevation areas or close to �lood zones – such as the Delridge, Union Street, Massachusetts, and South substations – may �lood as �looding risks change in the future (Figure 22). While the industry standard is for substations to be built one-foot higher than the historic 100-year �lood elevation, this may be insuf�icient as �looding becomes more intense due to climate change or if extreme �looding happens during compound extreme events, such as during the 2022 King Tides �looding (Costa & McAllister, 2017). Additionally, some of these substations in low-lying areas – such as the Massachusetts and South substations – are also in areas with high levels of impervious surfaces, which may make these substations particularly vulnerable to urban �looding impacts. Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 61Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 22. Flooding and Sea Level Rise Impacts on Energy Infrastructure in the Delridge, and SODO Areas of Seattle Notes: This set of maps overlays the 100-year and 500-year �loodplains and likely 2050 sea level rise of 3.1 feet (using a 1% likelihood scenario and including storm surge). Inset maps indicate areas where the Delridge substation and Union Street Substation are near the 500-year �loodplain (City of Seattle, 2022; Miller et al., 2018; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2021; Roop et al., 2018; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2020). Several miles of transmission lines pass through landslide prone areas and there are some substations that occur or are in close proximity to these zones (Figure 23). However, large landslides are low probability but high consequence events, and parts of the city that historically experience more landslides, such as the West Seattle and Interbay areas, may be more prone to energy disruption due to landslides (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2019). SCL has taken measures to reduce the sensitivity and increase the reliability of their transmission system to landslides, such as building redundancy in transmission line routes and designing a higher energy load capacity for each transmission line to distribute more energy if other lines are damaged from hazards such as landslides. Additionally, the majority of SCL transmission towers are made of steel and concrete, making them less susceptible to damage during a landslide. Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 62Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 23. Landside Risk to Transmission Lines and Substations Notes: This map overlays potential landslide areas with substations and transmission lines in Seattle. Two substations border potential landslide risk areas(City of Seattle, 2022; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2020). Extreme heat can increase power line sagging of overhead transmission lines and reduce the capacity and ef�iciency of overhead and underground transmission and distribution lines (Burillo et al., 2019; Fant et al., 2020). For example, by 2050, higher temperatures will reduce peak summertime load transmission capacity by 1.9 percent to 5.8 percent (Bartos et al., 2016). Additionally, warmer temperatures and extreme heat events can reduce the lifespan and ef�iciency of energy substations and transformers. Older energy assets are more sensitive to extreme heat and warmer ambient temperatures. For example, older transformers, which typically have a lifespan of about 40 years, are more likely to malfunction or overheat during heatwaves. While the city’s entire distribution and transmission systems will likely face impacts brought on from extreme heat, the most severe of these affects would be felt Cina sacraeadsi nogf tahned city that are more prone to urban heat island effect, such as areas in south Seattle and Georgetown (Figure 24). Heatwaves, such as the 2021 heat dome event (see Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 63Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Compounding Climate Impacts section), will continue to test the resiliency of Seattle’s Figure 24. Extreme Heat and Energy Infrastructure in Seattle energy systems. Notes: This map overlays areas in Seattle that experience higher temperatures with substations and transmission lines. The areas that have highest temperatures are SODO and the International District. There are two substations in this area and transmission lines that connect southern and northern Seattle (CAPA Strategies et al., 2021; City of Seattle, 2022). ENERGY DEMAND Historically, peak electricity demand is in the winter months for heating needs. However, as summers become warmers and heatwaves become more likely, energy demand is expected to increase in summer months as more residents rely on air conditioning (Raymond, 2013). Expected future population growth will also add increased energy demand across all seasons. Cooling degree days, or a measurement of the demand for cooling based on the daily average temperature compared to a baseline temperature for comfort (65°F), are expected to increase under all scenarios. Relative to 1980-2009, Seattle is expected to see projected increase in cooling degree days ranging from 430 to 493 days by mid-century under RCP8.5 (Figure 25) (Raymond & Rogers, 2022). Despite increases in future energy demand, energy supply is anticipated to meet this future demand. Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 64Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 25. Cooling Demand in King County through 2100 under RCP8.5 Notes: Data from the Climate Mapping for a Resilient Washington tool (Raymond & M. Rogers, 2022). Bars show the th th median cooling degree days in King County, and error bars show the range from the 10 to 90 percentile. Figure developed by Cascadia Consulting Group. Transportation Infrastructure Systems Transportation is the largest source of GHG emissions in the city, as well as the U.S. (King County, 2022). While efforts to mitigate emissions in this sector will affect the energy sector, this sector is also at risk to the impacts of climate change. Flooding and landslides, driven by intense precipitation, have washed out roads and highways, and extreme heat is causing train tracks to warp and bridges to swell (Hernandez, 2021). In extreme cases these impacts can lead to closure or failure of transportation infrastructure, but even more moderate impacts will reduce the capacity, ef�iciency, and lifespan of assets. Due to its geographic nature of being on an isthmus – or a narrow body of land surrounded by water – Seattle’s transportation network is a critical backbone that connects the city’s neighborhoods and promotes commerce to the broader region. Residents rely on many types of transportation systems to move around the city, including roadways, buses, commuter rail, street cars, bErcidogneosm, tiucn Vnuellsn, earnadb fielirtryies. Additionally, freight networks – such as rail, trucking, air, and maritime shipping – are vital to the local economy and broader supply chains (see section). If an emergency occurs, Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 65Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment transportation systems will also serve as a critical lifeline, providing routes that allow �irst responders to provide critical services and residents to evacuate. Within this analysis, 368 bridges, 339 public transit routes, 22 rail line segments, 17 Metro (Link) stations, eight miles of streetcar lines, three ferry/port terminals, and two airports were analyzed (Figure 26). Figure 26. Seattle Transportation Routes and Assets Notes: This map shows many types of Seattle transportation infrastructure considered in the analysis for this CVA: Link stations, rail and street car lines, bridges, transit routes, ports, and airports (City of Seattle, 2022; King County, n.d.; WSDOT, 2017). Transportation systems are vulnerable to a variety of climate impacts (Figure 27). Some impacts, such as �looding and extreme heat, can have immediate effects on assets like ferry terminals, roads, and railways (Spector, 2019). Public transit services can also be disrupted or limited by extreme events, which can affect the ability of residents who are dependent on public transportation. While transportation infrastructure failure is very unlikely to happen due to climate change, climate impacts can reduce the effectiveness and performance of Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 66Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment transportation networks that can make them more sensitive to failure during and after natural disasters (Jacobs et al., 2018). Figure 27. Transportation Assets at Risk of Damage from Heat, Flooding, and Heavy Precipitation Notes: This graphic shows which types of transportation infrastructure are most likely to be damaged by heat, coastal �looding and sea level rise, and heavy precipitation (Jacobs et al., 2018). FLOODING Seattle’s transportation system is moderately vulnerable to climate change Generally, . Increasing �looding risks, driven by sea level rise, extreme precipitation, and land use, have already affected and will continue to pose challenges for Seattle’s transportation infrastructure. Repeated �looding – even minor �looding – can damage transit routes and systems, such as railways. Additionally, �looding can increase the likelihood of injury or death for passengers, increase congestion due to slower traf�ic, and disrupt trips for residents and freight commerce (Abenayake et al., 2022; Suarez et al., 2005). For example, the rail line running along Carkeek Park in Northwest Seattle and transit routes operating in the Thornton Creek area will face coastal and urban �looding impacts. The most profound impacts of �looding can be seen along the Duwamish and Downtown areas due to their low elevations, where �looding risks and high levels of impervious surfaces will likely affect transit routes, bridge stability, rail lines, and port facilities (Figure 28). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 67Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 28. Transportation Assets and Flooding Notes: This �igure consists of three inset maps overlaying transportation infrastructure with the 100-year and 500-year �loodplains and 2050 sea level rise of 3.1 feet (using a 1% likelihood scenario and including storm surge). It shows that the rail line along Carkeek Park, transit routes in Thornton Creek, and many types of transportation infrastructure in the Duwamish and Downtown areas will be affected by �looding and sea level rise (City of Seattle, 2022; King County, n.d.; WSDOT, 2017). In addition to projected increase in �looding frequency and intensity, future sea level rise brought on by climate change will increase the exposure from �looding, storm surge and erosion transportation assets will face. Older assets – such as roads that have not been improved or retro�itted – are more prone to damage from repeated �looding events. Additionally, because of the lengthy processes to plan, permit, and retro�it or construct, there is a lower capacity of transportation systems to structurally prepare for future L�lAooNdDiSnLg IiDmEpSa cts. In addition to urban �looding, more frequent and intense extreme precipitation is associated with an increase in landslide risk. While minor landslides occur more frequently, they can temporarily block routes such as railways or roads. While a major landslide is unlikely to happen, it can lead to minor to major disruptions and potentially damage some transportation assets. Approximately 8.4 percent of Seattle is considered landslide-prone, particularly due to steep slopes (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2021). Some of Seattle’s transportation assets and routes are within or adjacent to potential landslide areas such as the BNSF railway in Northwest Seattle or light rail routes and stations – such as Rainier Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 68Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Beach Link Station and the railways along Boeing Field Airport – that run along Interbay and south Seattle areas (Figure 29). Figure 29. Transportation Assets and Landslide Hazards Notes: Figure 22 overlays transportation infrastructure with potential landslide areas. It consists of three inset maps that show that the BNSF in Northwest Seattle and the Rainier Beach Link Station, Boeing Field Airport, and railways in Interbay and South Seattle Areas are adjacent to potential landslide areas (City of Seattle, 2022; Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2021). While rare, landslides have disrupted many of these routes, affecting regional commerce and commuting routes for residents and workers. Between 1890 to 2000, 1,326 landslides have been recorded in the Seattle areas with a large proportion of them being connected to heavy winter precipitation and snowfall events. Some of these landslides have damaged roadways and public rights of way. Landslide impacts to rail have been very prevalent, with over 540 passenger train service disruptions occurring in the Puget Sound corridor between 2015 and 2018 (Boiko-Weyrauch, 2018). Since 2011, two train derailments caused by landslides have also occurred on routes running from Seattle to Everett (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2021). As heavy precipitation events become more prevalent, landslide risks will also increase due to the saturation and destabilization of soil (Crowe, 2018). This increases the likelihood of landslides around some new areas, such as the I-5 and I-90 intersect around the Beacon Hill neighborhood (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2021). Because both routes Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 69Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment handle such large amounts of traf�ic, closure or reduced capacity due to a landslide would lead impacts felt across Seattle and could affect the City’s ability to deliver services and eEvXaTcRuEaMteE r eHsEidAeTn ts. Extreme heat can cause pavement buckling and rutting, present safety hazards for drivers, pedestrians, and bikers. Extreme heat can also affCecats tchaed cinitgy ’as nLdig Chot mRapilo suynsdteimng b Iym cpauacsitnsg rail buckling or line sagging in the overhead catenary system. Many of these impacts were witnessed during the 2021 heat dome event (see section). Extreme heat impacts to transportation infrastructure will be most prominent in the Georgetown and South Seattle areas, as these parts of the city experience more intense heat island effects (Figure 30). Speci�ic assets – such as the SR 99-First Avenue Drawbridge – may experience higher than average ambient temperatures during extreme heat days that affects bridge opening and closing. Railways in this area are also more likely to buckle and are already monitored by rail operators during extreme heat days. Additionally, airplane takeoffs from King County International Airport can experience disruptions as warmer temperatures make it more dif�icult for airplanes to generate lift needed for takeoff. The International District, Stadium,P aunbdl iScO HDeOa llitghh tV rualinl esrtaatbioilnitsy are all open-air facilities, and Link Light Rail customers waiting for trains may face additional exposure to extreme heat and heat-related illnesses (see section). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 70Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 30. Transportation Assets and Extreme Heat Exposure Notes: This map overlays areas in the city most likely to experience extreme heat (the SODO and International District areas) with transportation infrastructure. Several types of infrastructure: street car lines, Link stations, rail lines, and transit routes – are located in the areas most likely to experience extreme heat (CAPA Strategies et al., 2021; City of Seattle, 2022; King County, n.d.; WSDOT, 2017). Transportation systems are usually designed based off historic climate conditions and standards. However, as temperatures continue to increase with climate change, these design standards will no longer be suf�icient to prevent roadway ways from buckling and railways from bending. Air travel is also expected to feel drastic impacts from rising temperatures, as studies indicate, that in coming decades, up to 30 percent of all �lights that depart at the hottest part of the day will be delayed or canceled due to takeoff challenges Water, Wastewater, and Drainage Infrastructure Systems (Worland, 2021). Water, wastewater, and drainage infrastructure are each exposed to a variety of climate change impacts, and some water infrastructure assets will be impacted and/or overwhelmed by impacts such as climate-induced extreme precipitation and sea level rise. Coastal wastewater treatment and conveyance infrastructure are at higher risk from coastal �looding impacts, some of which is driven by sea level rise, which can lead to over�low in sewer and combined systems and have cascading water quality impacts. Drinking water infrastructureR neegaior nthael Wcoaatsetr issh seudscseptible to saltwater intrusion, and heat and droughts are linked to an increase in demand for water, leading to water supply reductions and impacts (see section). Seattle’s water, wastewater, and drainage systems serve 1.5 million people in the greater Seattle area (Figure 31) (Seattle City Light, 2021). Seattle’s wastewater and drainage infrastructure are serviced by Seattle Public Utilities (SPU), which operates over 1,400 miles of wastewater pipes and over 400 stormwater lines 33 percent of the wastewater lines are combined to handle stormwater, while 40 percent is partially separated, and 27 percent are fully separated (Seattle Public Utilities, n.d.). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 71Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 31. Wastewater Treatment and Drinking Water Reservoirs in Seattle Notes: This map shows stormwater, wastewater, and water infrastructure in Seattle, including the West Point Water Treatment Plan, the Carkeek Park Sewage Disposal Treatment Plant, Wastewater Detention site, reservoirs, and pump 4 stations (City of Seattle, 2022). DRAINAGE AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE Seattle’s drainage and wastewater infrastructure system is moderately vulnerable to �looding associated with sea level rise and extreme precipitation Generally, . Seattle has three primary types of sewer systems that combine drainage and wastewater infrastructure: 1) combined sewer systems that convey wastewater and stormwater together to treatment plants; 2) separated systems where sewer pipes convey wastewater to treatment plants and different pipes convey stormwater to drainage outlets; and 3) partially separated sewer system where some pipes convey wastewater and stormwater to treatment plants and other pipes convey stormwater to drainage outlets (Seattle Public Utilities, 2021). 4 Additional construction is already underway – such as the Ship Water Quality Project – that will be part of the wastewater and drainage systems. Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 72Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 32. Types of Sewer Systems in Seattle Notes: From SPU’s Shape Our Water plan (Seattle Public Utilities, 2021). There are a few key mechanisms that sea level rise and �looding will impact stormwater and wastewater facilities. Some wastewater facilities near coastal areas on Puget Sound and Elliott Bay are susceptible to inundation due to sea level rise and coastal �looding (Figure 33). Additionally, wastewater lines can also experience backups during �looding events, which can exacerbate �looding and bring cascading impacts to areas that are not directly experiencing �looding (Hummel et al., 2018). Coastal �looding driven by storm surge and sea level rise could cause saltwater in�low, corroding equipment and reducing conveyance capacity (NOAA, 2022). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 73Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 33. Sea Level Rise and Flood Risks to Wastewater Infrastructure and Drinking Water Reservoirs Notes: There are three inset maps overlaying stormwater, wastewater, and water infrastructure with the 100-year and 500-year �loodplains and 2050 sea level rise of 3.1 feet (using a 1% likelihood scenario and including storm surge). It shows that the West Point Treatment Plan, Carkeek Wet Weather Treatment Station, and three pump stations in West Seattle could be affected by �looding and sea level rise(City of Seattle, 2022; Miller et al., 2018; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2021; Roop et al., 2018). In Discovery Park, the West Point Treatment Plant is in the 100-year �loodplain. The Carkeek Wet Weather Treatment Station also lies within the 100-year �loodplain, as do several combined sewer and runoff mainlines. A 2015 study identi�ied 17 different facilities, including pump stations, regulator stations, and outfalls, along the Duwamish River, West Seattle, and Downtown areas that will be affected by saltwater in�low (Phillips et al., 2015). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 74Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 34. Outfall Locations at Risk of Saltwater In�low from Sea Level Rise Notes: Figure from Phillips et al., 2015. The West Point Treatment Plan has historically been impacted by �looding. In February 2017, high tides and heavy rains induced electrical circuit malfunction that shut down the operating system (Department of Ecology State of Washington, 2017). This led to the release of 235 million gallons of untreated wastewater – including 30 million gallons of raw sewage – into Puget Sound (Willmsen & Mapes, 2017). This event endangered staff at the facility and caused water quality impacts for local beaches and nearshore habitats as much as a year after the event (King County, 2018; Willmsen & Mapes, 2017). Events like this, even though are unlikely, may happen again as compounding weather events such as winter storms and heavy rains will be exacerbated by sea level rise and increasing intensity of atmospheric rivers. Aging water systems are generally more sensitive to climate change impacts, and many combined systems were designed to convey �lows based on historic precipitation records rather than future climate data (Lall et al., 2018). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 75Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment In the past, extreme precipitation has also overwhelmed drainage and sewer systems and caused combined sewer over�lows (CSOs) that affect local water quality and nearshore habitats (Grodnik-Nagle et al., 2023). CSOs can cause beach closures, affect quality of local shell�ish, increaEsxet rpeomteen tRiaali nfo ar nhdar Pmrfeucli apligtaalt ibolonoms, reduce dissolved oxygen levels in local waterways, and increase public health risks. As extreme precipitation intensity increases (see section), CSO potential is expected to persist. Some areas with constrained drainage capacity that are in �loodplains or sea level rise inundation zones – such as areas along Thornton Creek in northeast Seattle and along the Duwamish River – will likely be more affected by drainage issues related to extreme rains, leading to unsafe urban �looding (Figure 35). Figure 35. Capacity Constrained Drainage Systems with Sea Level Rise and Flood Risks Notes: The map overlays capacity constrained drainage systems onto the 100- and 500-year �loodplain, and 2050 sea level rise of 3.1 feet (using a 1% likelihood scenario and including storm surge) (City of Seattle, 2022). Several of Seattle’s sewer lines run along the base of potential landslide areas, such as those in West Seattle, Interbay, and Carkeek Park. In total, there are more than seven instances where sewer mainlines run through landslide hills in Seattle (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2021). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 76Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 36. Wastewater Infrastructure and Drinking Water Reservoirs with Potential Landslide Areas Notes: The map overlays wastewater infrastructure and drinking water reservoirs with potential landslide areas. Some facilities and pump stations are in potential landslide areas (City of Seattle, 2022; Miller et al., 2018; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2021; Roop et al., 2018). Seattle’s drainage system is also at risk of damage from landslides. While all underground utilities are vulnerable to landslides, drainage systems are even more so due to their proximity to slopes (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2019). Several stormwater facilities and pump stations, as well as several combined sewer and stormwater mainlines are in potential landslide risk zones (Figure 36). In Seattle, eight percent of reported landslides have damaged elements of Seattle’s drainage system (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2021). As heavy and extreme precipitation are projected to iWnAcrTeEaRse S iUnP fuPtLuYr e years, the landslide risk to drainage systems also increases. Regional Watersheds Seattle is dependent on multiple watersheds for its drinking water, with the two largest sources being the Tolt and the Cedar River Watersheds. The section goes into further detail on the climate risks and vulnerabilities of Seattle’s drinking water supply. Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 77Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Natural Systems’ Vulnerability to Climate Change There are many natural systems – including urban forests, wetlands, rivers and creeks, and shorelines – in Seattle that provide a multitude of environmental bene�its and ecosystem services. For example, urban forests can provide shade for residents and habitat for birds and wildlife. Riparian areas can provide a natural �lood buffer that protects residents and infrastructure while also providing critical habitat for salmon, a Treaty-protected species for regional Tribes. This section evaluates the vulnerability to climate change of Seattle’s natural systems, including Seattle’s watersheds, habitat for salmon, urban tree canopy and green spaces, and 5 Watersheds environmental ly critical areas. A watershed is a basin of land that funnels rain and snow from higher elevation to lower elevation. This precipitation eventually collects in a shared waterway, such as a stream, river, or lake. Watersheds provide important terrestrial and aquatic habitat for wildlife, but conditions within watersheds can also impact �lood risk, drinking water quality, and hydropower availability for communities in and adjacent to them. Climate change disrupts the spatial and temporal distribution of water within watersheds, impacting both natural ecosystems and human-made infrastructure. The city relies on two large watersheds, the Cedar River Municipal Watershed and South Fork Tolt Municipal Watershed, for its drinking water supply and a small portion of its hydroelectric power (Raymond, 2013). Cedar River supplies 70 percent of Seattle’s drinking water, reserved in Chester Morse Lake and the Lake Youngs Reservoir, and has a hydropower capacity of 30 megawatts (MW). Jointly, the reservoirs have a storage capacity of approximately 14.5 billion gallons of water (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). South Fork Tolt supplies the remaining 30 percent of Seattle’s drinking water and provides a hydropower capacity of 16.8 MW. The South Fork Tolt Reservoir has a storage capacity of 18.3 billion gallons (Raymond, 2013). Although outside City limits, both watersheds are Generally,the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt Watersheds have a moderate to high fully or majority-owned by Seattle City Light (SCL). vulnerability to climate change due to reduced snowpack (Figure 37), increased winter Irnaifnrafasltl,r auncdtu lorewer summer �lows. The effects of climate change on the natural systems within these watersheds have the potential to affect infrastructure within the city (see section). Reduced snowmelt and summer rainfall within the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt watersheds will increase the likelihood of temporary summer 5 The City also owns additional assets within regional watersheds, however, those assets are not assessed as part of this vulnerability assessment because it resi des outside City borders. Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 78Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment droughts, which could impact drinking water supply for the city. Although Seattle is not projected to need a new water supply before 2060, seasonal drawdowns are expected under climate change. Hydropower capacity could also be impacted as a result. The following sections discuss climate impacts to regional watersheds – such as the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt Watersheds – that affect regional water supply and urban watersheds within the city, such as Thornton and Longfellow Creeks as well as the lower Duwamish River. Figure 37. April 1st Snowpack at Drought Levels Under RCP8.5 by 2050 Notes: This �igure shows regional changes to snowpack, which are likely to affect water availability to the city of Seattle. It shows that most areas are likely to experience decreased snowpack and several areas are 100 percent likely to have 75 percent less snowpack – which is considered drought levels – by 2050 under RCP8.5 (City of Seattle, 2022; Raymond & M. Rogers, 2022). REGIONAL WATERSHEDS AND WATER SUPPLY Snowpack and rainfall within the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt watersheds supply drinking water for the city. However, the snowpack and summer rainfall within these reservoirs have diminished due to warmer temperatures. In the Cedar River watershed, increases in spring �lows and decreases in summer �lows from 1949-2003 re�lect an earlier start to snowmelt and a reduced snowpack overall (Mote et al., 2018). This trend is consistent with watersheds throughout the western US: between 1955 and 2016, 92 percent of snow monitoring sites in the West experienced a decrease in mountain snowpack (Mote et al., 2018). Reduced snowpack contributed signi�icantly to the state- wide drought in 2015, which was re�lective of projected conditions in the 2050s (Marlier et al., 2017; Mote et al., 2016). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 79Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Seattle’s overall drinking water supply is projected to exceed demand through at least 2060 (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). However, demand may periodically exceed supply due to future shifts in temperature and precipitation regimes that affect water recharge in the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt watersheds (Raymond & Rogers, 2022). Further reduced snowpack, earlier snowmelt, and reduced summer rainfall will lead to temporary seasonal droughts that could impact drinking water availability for the city. This impact may be ampli�ied if customer water demand increases, especially during the hotter and drier summer months (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). By the 2050s, winter temperatures are projected to increase by 5.8°F under RCP8.5 in the Paci�ic Northwest relative to 1950-1999, leading to a 56-70 percent decrease in mountain snowpack throughout Washington by the 2080s (relative to 1916-2006 average; Snover et al., 2013). Many of the watersheds currently characterized as mixed snow-and-rain basins, including the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt watersheds, will shift to rain-dominant basins (<10% winter precipitation captured as snowpack) by the 2040s, under A1B (Snover et al., 2013). The likelihood of snowpack at drought levels (below 75% normal snowpack) will be 100 percent by 2050 for many of the areas within the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt watersheds (Figure 37). Figure 38. Changes in Monthly Stream�low in the Cedar River Watershed under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 by the 2050s and 2080s Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 80Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Notes: Plots show monthly average stream�low for the water year compared to historical stream�low by the 2050s and 2080s under CMIP5 scenarios. The thick colored lines show the median among 10 climate models (Mauger et al. 2015). Even for areas with snowpack, warmer temperatures will lead to an earlier start to snowmelt each spring. For the Cedar River and Tolt watersheds, �lows are predicted to peak 4-9 weeks earlier than their 1917-2006 start dates by the 2080s (Figure 38) (Snover et al., 2013). Reduced and earlier snowmelt, coupled with predicted declines in summer precipitation rates, will lead to low summer stream �lows that are 34-44 percent less than their historic averages, under the same climate scenario (Snover et al., 2013). These changes are likely to impact water availability during the summer (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). Finally, while rare, there have been wild�ires within King County (King County Emergency Management, 2020). Fire risk is increasing for the western Cascades due to climate change and population growth that is expanding the wildland-urban interface. By the 2040s, the area burned is expected to triple (from 2,700 acres to 8,000 acres per year) relative to 1980-2006 in the western Cascades (Morgan et al., 2019). Wild�ires within the forested Tolt and Cedar watersheds will have impacts to water quality, supply, and habitats and could Reservoir Infrastructure damage various infrastructure assets. Water from the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt watersheds collects into a series of reservoirs and regulating basins and is then conveyed to customers through SPU-owned transmission and distribution systems. Operations at these reservoirs and the associated Masonry, Landsburg, Lake Youngs, and South Fork Tolt dams can be disrupted by both �looding and very low stream �lows, both of which are more likely to occur under climate change (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). Winter precipitation is projected to increase by about 6 percent west of the Cascades by 2050, relative to 1950-1999 levels under RCP8.5 (Morgan et al., 2021). Greater winter rainfall will contribute to increased winter �lood risk, which could impact reservoir capacity at Masonry and Tolt dams, affect hydropower infrastructure on the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt, and lead to �looding downstream (Raymond, 2013). However, the impact of increased �lows downstream of Cedar River and South Fork Tolt reservoirs has not been fully evaluated (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). Extreme precipitation can also decrease water quality by increasing turbidity, putting additional strain on water treatment facilities (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019b). As with the drinking water supply,E rnedeurgcyed I nsnfroawstpraucckt uanred Sdyesctleinmess in summer rainfall will lead to lower summer stream �lows that could affect the reliability of hydropower generation (Raymond, 2013) (see section). Summer precipitation is projected to decrease by about 12 percent west of the Cascades by 2050, relative to 1950-1999 levels under RCP8.5 (Morgan et al., 2021). Although Cedar River and South Fork Tolt represent only 2 percent of SCL’s hydropower capacity, they are likely to experience the effects of climate change sooner than higher-elevation watersheds supporting hydroelectric operations on the Pend Oreille and Skagit Rivers, because they are Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 81Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment mid-elevation basins near the present snowline (Raymond, 2013; Seattle Public Utilities, 2U0R1B9AaN) .

Under all climate scenarios, more winter precipitation will increase urban �lood risk and the potential for runoff and toxins to accumulate in sensitive waterways. During the summer, reduced rainfall will affect riparian habitat and impact �ish populations, as water temperatures increase and dissolved oxygen concentrations drop. Where creeks and rivers �low into estuaries, sea level rise is likely to limit habitat quality and availability.

Distribution of Urban Watersheds, Wetlands, Riparian Corridors, and Wildlife Habitat within Seattle Notes: This �igure shows urban watercourses, environmentally critical wetlands, wildlife corridors, and urban creek watersheds in and immediately outside the City of Seattle (City of Seattle, 2022). Local Flood Risk Infrastructure WVuiltnheinr athbeil citityy of Seattle, increased winter peak �lows in urban creeks and waterways are likely to expose infrastructure and buildings to greater �lood risk (see section). Low-lying areas that are already more prone to �looding, such as developed areas surrounding the Lower Duwamish (Figure 3), are especially at risk for greater riverine �looding. Flooding may also impact water quality, as sediment, nutrients, and pollutants accumulate in urban waterways. Excess sediment and particulate matter can suffocate the eggs, larvae, and adults of many �ish species, as well as invertebrates (Panthi et al., 2022). Increased nitrogen and phosphorous loading – which can be ampli�ied by runoff or sewer over�lows associated with development – cause hypoxic and anoxic conditions that can also lead to detrimental algal blooms that impact the entire aquatic ecosystem (Carey et al., 2013). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 83Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Ecosystem Effects of Warmer Temperatures and Drought In the Seattle region, maximum summertime air temperatures are predicted to increase 6.3°F by 2050 (Raymond & Rogers, 2022). Bodies of water absorb heat as air temperatures rise and are therefore also projected to experience temperature increases under all scenarios, especially during the summer (Land Trust Alliance, 2023; Van Vliet et al., 2012). This will negatively impact cold water-adaptive native �ish, which have lower thermal tolerances. It may also bene�it nonnative, warm water-adapted species, who compete with native species (Steel et al., 2018). Additionally, dissolved oxygen concentrations are lower in warmer water, which is likely to cause additional stress and facilitate harmful algal blooms (Urgenson et al., 2021). Low summer stream�lows due to reduced summer precipitation and reduced shading from riparian trees will only exacerbate these problems for shallower waterways (Mantua et al., 2009). Seattle’s current focus on increasinUgr bcaanno Tprye ceo vCearn tohpryo uagnhdo uOtp tehne Sciptya cheass the potential to mitigate some of these effects, if focused on areas directly adjacent to urban Sea Level Rise and Nearshore Habitat waterways and associated estuaries (see section). Sea Level Rise Sea levels are projected to rise by 3.1 to 3.2 feet by 2100 under RCP8.5 (see section) (Roop et al., 2018). This increase, coupled with storm surge impacts (Yang et al., 2019), has the potential to eliminate or alter existing estuarine habitat in Seattle. Habitat responses to sea level rise are highly variable and depend on site-speci�ic factors, and there are currently no models for the Duwamish or Salmon Bay estuaries (Hall et al., 2023; Thorne et al., 2018). However, a recent model evaluating �ive other estuaries in Washington State, including three in Puget Sound, found that under a high sea level rise scenario (+4.6 feet, or +142 cm), 68 percent of existing wetland area will be submerged by 2110 (Thorne et al., 2018). This would signi�icantly limit wetland and nearshore habitat in and around Seattle, affecting the ability of habitat to mitigate coastal �looding risks, the survival of various shell�ish species that can improve water quality, and nearshore habitat that provide juvenile habitat for native �ish species. While unlikely, sea level rise could create new nearshore habitat farther up the shoreline (Thorne et al., 2018). Throughout its urban watersheds, the City of Seattle is already involved in infrastructure improvements and remediation work that can reduce the risk and consequences of increased �looding under climate change. Connecting �loodplains and improving drainage are two signi�icant goals. For example, the City is partnering with the Mid Sound Fisheries Enhancement Group, Green Seattle Partnership, and King County Noxious Weeds Program to create the new Lake City Floodplain Park, which will improve water quality, reduce erosion, and minimize future �looding in Thornton Creek. In the Longfellow Creek watershed, Seattle Public Utilities and the Seattle Department of Transportation are constructing natural drainage systems that will reduce �looding and pollution from storm runoff. The City is also re-imagining shoreline areas around the Duwamish River to reduce �looding risks while increasing community resiliency for neighborhoods like South Park. Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 84Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Salmon Habitat As an important ecological and cultural keystone species in the Paci�ic Northwest. Salmon connect predator, prey, and scavenger populations throughout their food webs, as their populations support freshwater invertebrates to marine mammals to terrestrial carnivores to avian scavengers. As a result, salmon are vital to the health and stability of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats in the Paci�ic Northwest, and any effect of climate change on salmon populations will be felt throughout these ecosystems. Salmon are also a critical First Food and cultural symbol for tribal communities, such as the Duwamish, Suquamish, Muckleshoot, Snoqualmie, Tulalip Tribes, and the city’s urban Native community. Their populations also sustain local, regional, and recreational �isheries. More broadly, salmon are woven into the fabric of the Paci�ic Northwest and the region’s sense of identity (May et al., 2018). However, salmon populations have been declining in Washington State since the late 1800s due to a variety of factors including dam construction, over�ishing, and development. Despite signi�icant investment in habitat recovery, protected hatcheries, and stricter �ishing regulations, populations continue to shrink, and many are now listed under the Endangered Species Act. Climate change represents another threat to an already-vulnerable species, along with over�ishing, reduced habitat availability, and loss of genetic diversity. Throughout its urban waterways and estuaries, the city provides critical habitat for many salmonid species, including federally threatened populations of Chinook, steelhead, and bull trout (City of Seattle, 2015). The city overlaps with two Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIA), the Lake Washington/Cedar/Sammamish Watershed (WRIA 8) and the Green/Duwamish and Central Puget Sound Watershed (WRIA 9). In Seattle, salmon migrate through the Ballard Locks, the Ship Canal, and Lake Washington or through streams that connect directly to Puget Sound, such as Pipers Creek. Maintaining and recovering viable salmon populations in Seattle and throughout WRIAs 8 and 9 requires preserving existing high-quality habitats that collectively support all phases of the salmon life cycle, from spawning and incubation through rearing and outmigration back into Puget Sound. Locally, Seattle’s waters are especially important during juvenile migration, when salmon transition from their natal freshwater rivers, tributaries, and creeks into the saltier Duwamish estuary and Salmon Bay, where they undergo physiological transformations that allow them to survive in a fully marine environment. Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 85Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 40. Climate Change Impacts on Paci�ic Salmon Notes: Figure depicts climate change impacts across the lifecycle of Paci�ic salmon (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2021). Generally, salmon are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, though there is some variability depending on salmonid species and life stage (Figure 40). Some of the key climate risks to salmon include: 1) increased winter peak �lows could disrupt salmon eggs and fry and expose juvenile salmon to increased pollutants and storm runoff as �lood risk increases in urban areas, 2) warmer water temperatures and associated dips in dissolved oxygen levels could directly or indirectly increase mortality rates of salmon in freshwater habitat, especially in the Lake Washington Ship Canal, and 3) sea level rise could eWliImNTinEaRt eP eExAisKt iFnLgO nWeaSr s hore habitat, which is crucial for out-migrating juvenile salmon. Urban Watershed Higher peak stream�lows due to increased winter rainfall will negatively impact Seattle’s salmon populations by increasing �lood risk (see section). Streambed scour caused by more frequent and intense �looding physically disrupts salmon redds and increases egg and parr mortality rates (Mantua et al., 2009). Excess sediment and particulate matter can also suffocate sensitive salmon eggs and larvae (Panthi et al., 2022). Additionally, the potential increase in pollutant-laden storm runoff is a particular threat to salmon, which accumulate and retain PCBs and other toxins as they move up the food chain Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 86Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment (Meador et al., 2010). This is especially a risk in the highly polluted Duwamish estuary, WwhAeRrMe EpRa rWtsA oTf EthRe T wEMatPerEsRhAeTdU isR dEeSs ignated as an EPA Superfund site. Urban Watersheds Warmer water temperatures will threaten the survival of �ish species with lower thermal tolerances (see section). Water temperatures consistently above 71.6°F (22°C) lead directly to salmon mortality, while temperatures above 59.0°F (15°C) can decrease reproductive success and increase infection rates from a variety of pathogens (Mantua et al., 2009; Urgenson et al., 2021; Water Quality Program, 2002). Because shallower and smaller bodies of water absorb heat more quickly than deeper and larger bodies of water, smaller creeks and the Lake Washington Ship Canal are especially susceptible to temperature increases (Mantua et al., 2009; Urgenson et al., 2021). As a result, they will have fewer cold-water refugia available for migrating salmon. High water temperatures in the ship canal already serve as barriers to migration for spawning adults. They also negatively impact out-migrating juveniles by allowing predators with higher thermal tolerances to �lourish (Mantua et al., 2009; WRIA 8, 2017). The WRIA 8 Salmon Recovery Council lists the current high temperatures and water quality within the Lake Washington Ship Canal as some of the greatest barriers to Chinook recovery within WRIA 8 (SWEAR ILAE 8V,E 2L0 R1I7S)E. AND NEARSHORE SALMON HABITAT Urban Watersheds Sea level rise in Seattle has the potential to limit critical habitat for juvenile salmon in the Duwamish and Salmon Bay estuaries (see section). Estuaries provide vital refuge and resources for juveniles during the smolt stage, when their bodies acclimate to higher saltwater concentrations and their growth rates accelerate before moving into marine waters as mature adults. The habitat diversity within estuarine nurseries provides the prey and nutrient abundance growing salmon need, while also offering protection from predators. Even without full submergence, rising sea levels could disrupt the temporal patterns of prey availability and productivity on which salmon have evolved to depend, as tides and wFRaEteSrH tWemATpeErRa tHuAreBsI TsAhiTft A wViAthILinA eBsItLuITarYi eAsN (DD aCvOisN eNt EaCl.,T 2IV02IT2Y) . Freshwater riparian and lake ecosystems provide critical overwintering refugia and rearing habitat for juvenile salmon, as well as spawning areas for adult salmon. These urban ecosystems also provide habitat for other wildlife, shade for surrounding residents, and opportunities for recreation. Climate-related hazards – such as extreme heat and �looding – interact with land use, placing some of these habitats at-risk. While the city is engaged in numerous initiatives to preserve, improve, and restore this freshwater habitat (WRIA 8, 2017). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 87Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 41. Areas of Potential Salmonid Habitat for Rearing and Refuge in Longfellow Creek Notes: The �igure shows areas of best, fair, and poor potential for salmon rearing and refuge in Longfellow Creek. Most areas indicated on the map appear to be rated at fair to best (Lyons, 2022). Restoring �loodplain connectivity is one of the best ways to improve salmon rearing capacity in the Cedar River watershed and smaller urban watersheds (WRIA 8, 2017). The City has also already identi�ied areas within urban waters that have the greatest potential to provide refuge, rearing, and/or spawning habitat, which could be the focus of future conservation efforts (Figure 41) (Lyons, 2022). For example, in some waterways, such as Taylor and Longfellow Creeks, the best available habitat remains upstream of signi�icant Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 88Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment �ish passage barriers.

At the same time, however, climate change poses many risks to urban trees themselves, and threatens their capacity to provide these important ecosystem services. Urban tee canopy currently covers 28.1 percent of the city and has declined since the 2016 tree canopy assessment that showed about 28.6 percent coverage (Figure 42) (City of Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability & Environment, 2021). The majority of canopy cover is concentrated in residential neighborhoods on private land, where the City regulates and supports tree planting, maintenance, and removal (47%; Figure 43). An additional 23 percent of canopy exists on right-of-way property, including streets, sidewalks, and planting strips. While private property owners adjacent to right-of-way land are usually responsible for tree maintenance, various City departments also manage urban forests and permitting processes throughout the City. The City of Seattle also owns and directly manages public trees in natural and developed park areas, accounting for 19 percent of canopy cover (Figure 43). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 89Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 42. Tree Canopy Coverage and Street Trees in Seattle in 2021 Notes: This �igure shows areas of green where there is tree canopy coverage in Seattle (City of Seattle, 2022).

Distribution of Seattle’s 2021 Canopy Coverage by Land Management Unit Notes: The chart shows how tree canopy coverage in Seattle is distributed by land use type, including across types of private, public, and right-of-way land (City of Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability & Environment, 2021). At the neighborhood level, canopy cover is not distributed equitably throughout Seattle. Neighborhoods that scored as most disadvantaged on the Racial and Social Equity Composite Index, designated as environmental-justice priority areas for the city, have 31 percent less cover than the most advantaged neighborhoods (City of Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability & Environment, 2C0o2m1m). Tuhneitsye Aarmeaesn aitriee as larenadd Wy melolbste aint grisk from climate change, and any impacts to their limited existing canopy cover may be felt more acutely than elsewhere in the city (see section). Where canopy cover exists, trees cool their surrounding air through shade and evapotranspiration, cutting energy costs, reducing strain on the power grid, and mitigating the effects of urban heat islands (Safford et al., 2013). For every additional 13 percent of canopy coverage across several Seattle blocks, air temperature decreases by 0.5°F (City of Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability & Environment, 2021). In 2012, urban trees saved the City an estimated 43,000 mega-watt-hours of electricity and 1.6 million BTUs each year (Green Cities Research AUllirabnacne, W20a1te2r).s Shheaddse from trees can also insulate urban waterways from high temperatures that would otherwise negatively impact salmon and other �ish populations (see section). Public Health Urban canopies can play an additional role in intercepting precipitation and airborne pollutants, depending on species composition and season (see section). For both deciduous and coniferous trees, rainfall is distributed across the collective leaf surface area, slowing the rate at which it is absorbed into the ground below or is shed as runoff (Green Cities Research Alliance, 2012). Pollutants and particulate matter may also be deposited onto leaves and other tree surfaces, temporarily suspending them and improving air quality (Pace & Grote, 2020; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2008). Seattle’s trees eliminate approximately 725 metric tons of pollutants each year (Green Cities Research Alliance, 2012). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 91 revoC yponaC elttaeS ot noitubirtnoCSeattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Generally, Seattle’s urban trees and the bene�its they offer have a moderate to high vulnerability to climate change, due to increased heat, drought, and pathogen stress, IliNmCiRtiEnAgS thEeDi rH aEbAilTit yS TtoR EpSroSv ide these important ecosystem bene�its. The longer and warmer summers predicted for the Paci�ic Northwest under climate change will negatively impact the city’s urban tree population through increased exposure to heat stress and pathogen pressure. The probability of Seattle experiencing a heatwave that lasts more than 3 days will increase from 67 percent to 86 percent by 2050 (First Street Foundation, n.d.). Climate Change Trends and HPreoajte scttrieosnsess trees primarily by causing dehydration, which is also more likely to occur under climate change due to reduced summer rainfall (see section). Heat can also interact with other drivers and increase the risk of tree mortality. For example, leaves tend to accumulate higher sugar concentrations in response to hot and dry conditions, which can make them more attractive to herbivorous insects (Safford et al., 2013). Longer summers may also translate into longer breeding seasons and accelerated population growth for existing pests, while an in�lux of new pest species from warmer climates will exert additional pressure on the city’s urban forests (City of Seattle USHrbIFaTnI FNoGr ePsRtrEyC CIPoIrTeA TTeIaOmN, 2P0A2T0T)E. RNS AND DROUGHT Reduced precipitation rates during the summer, coupled with an increase in winter rainfall and more intense winter storms, will also impact Seattle’s urban tree community. The greater likelihood of summer drought conditions will exacerbate heat and pathogen stress, and will affect both the recruitment of new, young trees into the urban tree population and the survival of existing older trees (City of Seattle Urban Forestry Core Team, 2020). Stressed trees are also more at risk of injury or being uprooted during winter precipitation events, as snow and ice accumulate on branches and as trees are exposed to severe wind (City of Seattle Urban Forestry Core Team, 2020; Safford et al., 2013). Additionally, �looding from these storms may waterlog soils and overwhelm root systems, leading to tree death. Ultimately, changing temperature and precipitation regimes will lead to range shifts for some trees that have historically been well-suited to the Seattle region, including many species of conifer (City of Seattle Urban Forestry Core Team, 2020). However, both the conifer and deciduous tree populations within the city are at risk. The current deciduous population is primarily composed of older, second-growth trees that are approaching the end of their natural lifespan, increasing their sensitivity to the stressors described above (City of Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability & Environment, 2021; City of Seattle Urban Forestry Core Team, 2020). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 92Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Cascading and Compounding Climate Impacts Systems – social, economic, and infrastructural – are interconnected. These systems both rely on one another and provide support. Thus, climate change impacts to one system will inevitably have cascading or compounding effects across multiple systems (May et al., 2018). However, many of these impacts are dif�icult to model or predict because of their interdependent nature, leading to potential “surprises” – or events and impacts that fall outside the scope of climate models (Kopp et al., 2017). Changes in the climate – such as warmer temperatures, decreased snowpack, sea level rise – have already led to direct impacts to some of our systems. However, not all effects occur in the same way or emerge at the same time, leading to impacts that propagate across timescales and contexts – or cascading impacts (Lawrence et al., 2020). Figure 44. Framework on Interrelated Systems and Potential Cascading Impacts across Systems Notes: Figure from LA County Climate Vulnerability Assessment(LA County, 2021). Cascading and Compounding Climate Impacts | 93Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Traditional risk or vulnerability assessments typically treat hazards independent from one another.

Additionally, climate hazards and extreme events that co-occur with other non-climatic extreme events – such as the COVID-19 pandemic – often amplify burdens and limit response options (Ford et al., 2022; Zang et al., 2021). For example, the 2.5 co-occurrence of dramatic increases in PM concentrations due to wild�ires in the Northwest were associated with increased exposure to COVID-19 incidences and deaths in the Puget Sound region (Zhou et al., 2021). Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests that there are cascading mental health implications when extreme events or disasters co- occur (Sugg et al., 2022). The city of Seattle has experienced multiple extreme events – such as the Heat Dome event in 2021. Currently, there are limitations in how to quantitatively evaluate cascading and compounding impacts from these extreme events. Additionally, there is lag-time between the occurrence of extreme events and documentation of these events in the peer-reviewed literature base (Roesch-Mcnally et al., 2020). Thus, these sections rely largely on media outlets, which often are the �irst to describe and report on extreme events and associated acute impacts. This section attempts to illuminate some of these potential impacts from cascading and 2com0p2oun1di nHg eevenatst u sDingo thme 20e21 hEeavt deomne tev ent as a case study. The city of Seattle – along with the rest of the Paci�ic Northwest, from northern California through southeast Alaska – experienced an unprecedented extreme heat wave from mid- June through early July, known as a heat dome event. The 2021 heat dome event – which was caused by a high-pressure system that blocked cool maritime winds and cloud formation – is a highly improbable and extreme weather event, even under current climate change conditions (White et al., 2023). However, the likelihood of an event like the 2021 heat dome was made more likely in part due to climate change (Philip et al., 2022; White et al., 2023). During the heat dome event, Seattle experienced temperatures that were 30°F warmer than the historical average for the same time period. Seattle set temperature records of 108°F, and there were three consecutive days with temperatures that exceeded 100°F. Other neighboring cities saw temperatures exceed 110°F (National Weather Service, 2021). Nighttime temperatures, which often serve as a period of cooling respite, were warmer than historical daytime averages for the same periods. Access to air conditioning or cooling centers during heat events is critical for a community’s ability to adapt to extreme heat impacts, particularly for sensitive populations. In response to the 2021 heat dome, the City and its partners opened 36 “cooling centers” at community Cascading and Compounding Climate Impacts | 94Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment facilities (i.e., senior centers, community centers, libraries), hygiene centers, and emergency shelters for people experiencing homelessness, and 30 beaches, pools, spray parks, and wading pools for people to cool off (City of Seattle Opens Additional Cooling Centers and Updated Guidance for Staying Cool in Extreme Heat, 2021). Figure 45. Temperature Anomalies for June 27, 2021 Relative to Average Temperatures for the Same Date from 2014-2020, Adapted from NASA Earth Observatory Notes: This �igure shows elevated temperatures on June 27, 2021 across the western United States and Canada. In some areas, temperatures were 35 degrees F higher than they were on average from 2014-2020 (Popovich & Choi-Schagrin, 2021). Because of the heat dome, the city of Seattle saw a lot of cascading impacts across its communities and systems – from impacts to public health and the built environment to the local economy. Some of these impacts are still being studied, and research is underway to attribute some of these consequences to the 2021 heat dome event. Below are Cascading and Compounding Climate Impacts | 95Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment some of the key cascading impacts that have already been documented. There are likely Public Health Impacts additional impacts that have yet to be documented and/or are still emerging. The 2021 heat dome led to extremely signi�icant increases in heat-related illnesses and deaths (Schramm et al., 2020; Weinberger, 2022). Across the Paci�ic Northwest, heat- related emergency room visits were 69 times higher during the heat dome event compared to 2019 (Schramm et al., 2020) (Figure 46Figure 1). In King County, there were 30 heat- related deaths and many other heat-related injuries (Weinberger, 2022). The excess morbidity and mortality attributed to the heat dome event disproportionately affected older residents and low-income households without air conditioning capacity (Fisher et al., 2021; Schramm et al., 2020). Furthermore, emergency responders and emergency room staff were overextended in treating heat-related injuries and illnesses during the heat dome event, acutely stressing the regional health safety net after a period of chronic stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (Weinberger, 2022). Figure 46. Number of Emergency Department Visits for Heat-Related Illness in U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Region 10 (WA, OR, ID, And AK) and Nationwide (Excluding Region 10) from May 1–June 30, 2019 and 2021 Notes: The �igure shows elevated emergency department visits for heat-related illness in the Paci�ic Northwest and nationwide during the period of the 2021 heat dome event (Schramm et al., 2020). Documented heat-related illnesses and deaths almost certainly underestimate the true health toll of the heat dome event (Popovich & Choi-Schagrin, 2021). People without health insurance, low-income households, socially isolated individuals, BIPOC, women, and people who do not �luently speak English are underserved by emergency medical services (Farcas et al., 2022; Schramm et al., 2020; USDA Northwest Climate Hub, n.d.). Thus, documented heat-related illnesses and deaths during and after the heat dome event likely undercounts Cascading and Compounding Climate Impacts | 96Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment the rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality for these groups (Popovich & Choi- Schagrin, 2021). Preliminary research is beginning to document the mental health toll – such as increased anxiety – of the heat dome event on residents across the Paci�ic Northwest (Bratu et al., 2022). Additional mental health consequences – both acute and chronic mental health illnesses – are likely to continue emerging as scholarship around extreme heatwaves continues to evolve. For example, evidence suggests associations between heatwaves with domestic violence, abnormal birth outcomes, adverse maternal health outcomes, and self- harm and suicide (Cil & Cameron, 2017; Sanz-Barbero et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2018). As of yet, no research has been conducted on the community health outcomes associated Infrastructure Impacts with the 2021 heat dome event. The heat dome event also had dramatic impacts on the city of Seattle’s infrastructure systems. Across the greater Seattle area, there were at least �ive instances of pavement buckling on I-5 and I-90 that required maintenance from WSDOT responders (Crowe, 2021) (Figure 47). The City also had to spray cool water on the city’s moveable steel bridges (Crowe, 2021), as extreme heat can expand the joints that connect two bridge spans (Palu & Mahmoud, 2019). Additionally, public transit agencies such as Sound Transit had to implement slow orders to monitor rail tracks, which can expand during extreme heat events, and the overhead catenary system, which can sag and loosen during extreme heat events (Whitely Binder et al., 2013). These collective impacts to the transportation system disrupted traf�ic, increased congestion, and increased occupational exposure to extreme heat conditions for maintenance workers and responders. While other localities around Washington experienced energy blackouts and brownouts due to high energy demand for cooling (Geranios & Selsky, 2021), the city generally has capacity to accommodate additional energy loads during peak demand times (Alexander et al., 2022; Raymond, 2013). This allows greater resiliency during events such as the heat dome. However, as additional changes to the climate affect regional snowpack and precipitation patterns, the timing of energy supply for hydroelectric sources may be insuf�icient to meet future energy demand (Raymond, 2013), especially during extreme events (e.g., 2021 heat dome) that that require systems to be resilient and continue to function at increased capacity.

Economic Impacts The heat dome event also had many acute, and likely chronic, economic consequences for residents and businesses. Many restaurants in Seattle had to temporarily shut down due to excessive heat and insuf�icient ventilation or cooling capacity for its workers (Figure 48) (Pae, 2021). Many other workers and businesses – from factory workers to educators to construction workers – had work temporarily halted due to the extreme heat (Layne, 2E0co2n1o).m Thicis V lueldn teor laobsitl ilatybor hours and associated wages for these workers. Lost wages associated with extreme heat are projected to continue increasing in the future (see section). Financial instability – even short-term instability – from the heat dome event has also been linked to additional anxiety for residents in the Paci�ic Northwest (Bratu et al., 2022). Additional health burden for workers exposed to extreme heat may place increased �inancial burden on these individuals, especially for workers that lack health insurance coverage from their employers (SE.c Loanwormenicc eV, u2l0n2e1r)a. bAidlidtyitionally, small businesses will have more dif�iculty recovering revenue and operational ef�iciency due to economic shocks like the heat dome event (see section). It Cascading and Compounding Climate Impacts | 98Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment is very likely that the long-term economic consequences – for businesses and workers – have yet to be fully understood.

Warren/AP. 2022 King Tide Flood Event nd th In late December 2022 – between December 22 through December 28 – the city experienced multiple consecutive events that led to compounding �looding impacts across the city. Seattle experienced a historic winter storm that included snowfall and freezing rain nd rd on December 22 and December 23 (Bleed & Hollingsworth, 2022). Several days later, on th December 27 , the city also experienced a king tide – a colloquial term that references exceptionally high tides – combined with storm surge during a low-pressure storm to create a �lood event across shoreline areas in Seattle that was the highest recorded �lood in over 30 years (Sundell, 2022). Finally, the city and the Paci�ic Northwest experienced a th series of heavy rains driven by atmospheric rivers between December 27 and December st 31 (Bekiempis, 2022). Cascading and Compounding Climate Impacts | 99Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 49. Multiple Consecutive Events in December 2022 Led to Severe King Tide Flooding and Limited Response Capacity Independent from each other, each of these events would have resulted in mild to severe �looding – rain-on-snow snowmelt, atmospheric rivers, and King Tides can all cause �looding. However, in sequence, these events lead to compounding and amplifying �looding impacts as systems may not have conveyed all water before the next event and response capacity may be limited due to safety concerns of �irst responders (Figure 49). Additionally, the December 2022 King Tide event was an exceptionally high King Tide that led to unprecedented �looding – with �looding approximately 13 feet (NAVD88) – for neighborhoods like South Park, which was further worsened by the winter storm immediately before and the atmospheric rivers immediately after the King Tide event. While it is dif�icult to attribute a speci�ic King Tide event to climate change, King Tides provide a glimpse into what future sea levels will look like. The 2022 King Tide event is similar to projected sea levels in the 2080s under RCP8.5. Water overtopped the riverbanks �irst at the lowest points along the bank in South Park, th including the intersections of 5 Ave. S and S Fontanelle St. and S Riverside St. and S Austin St. As the water rose higher, higher elevation areas of the bank began to over�low, including th th the intersection of S Riverside Dr. and S 7 Ave. and the intersection of S 8 Ave. and S Portland St. In addition to �looding coming over the riverbanks, 13 households were displaced, and families and businesses in South Park experienced sewer over�lows inside homes and buildings as the high river water pushed backward into combined sewer and stormwater pipes. Street �looding from stormwater was also observed in low-lying areas in Georgetown affecting multiple industrial properties. Cascading and Compounding Climate Impacts | 100Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Conclusion Climate Resilience Opportunities This CVA outlines the city of Seattle’s physical and social vulnerabilities to the most critical known climate hazards. The areas of vulnerability discussed in this assessment overlap and intersect with social injustices – including income inequality, disparities in health outcomes and access to amenities and services, and access to safe, adequate housing. The City is committed to responding to the multitude of challenges presented by climate change and supporting a more equitable and resilient future for all residents. This CVA has assessed climate change impacts and social and physical vulnerability across Seattle. It has identi�ied that �looding and sea level rise, extreme heat, wild�ire smoke, and extreme precipitation will have wide-ranging and interconnected impacts for the city. There • Invest in community services are some key, broad areas that the City can invest in to address these: , including cooling and clean air centers, access to cooling and air �iltration systems for homes, and tree canopy.

Conclusion | 101Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Integration into One Seattle Comprehensive Plan Next, the City will integrate �indings from this CVA into the Seattle One Plan, or the City’s Comprehensive Plan Update, to both re�lect the City’s goals and priorities and comply with a new requirement to include a Climate Element. The City will develop policies to address areas of vulnerability outlined in this CVA, including to protect assets across the city and to recognize, improve the social roots of vulnerability for communities in Seattle, and integrate climate resilience considerations into City decision-making processes – ensuring that research and initiatives across departments are shared and can drive citywide planning. 1. Set a vision, objectives, and goals to guide adaptation planning. To further develop adaptation actions using the results of this CVA, the City can: 2.

Detailed Methodology and Results This section will describe the methodology and detailed results of the index approach Cascadia used to determine relative social vulnerability of census tracts. The Social and Economic Vulnerability Assessment utilizes an index approach, which is a method to qFuauntlilta tLiveilys ntor moafliz eI mnudltipilce caritteroia rthsat aClloowsn fors coimdpeararbeilidty. We developed a potential list of sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators by referencing comparable vulnerability assessments, such as those from the City of Redmond (WA) and Los Angeles County (CA), as well as a technical guidance document from the University of Notre Dame (BERK Consulting, Inc.; Perteet; The Watershed Company; UW Climate Impacts Group, 2022; LA County, 2021; Chen, et al., 2015). After developing the initial list, we solicited additional potential indicators and data sources from City staff and through additional data requests. • Is the data relevant? We then vetted all potential indicators by asking the following questions: • Is the data available?W e used indicators that are as recent as possible and that have clear connections to climate change. • Is the data high qualitDya? tasets need to be publicly available or shareable without sensitive and identi�iable dat a being shared. • Is the data at a census traWcet- laevvoeidl erdes doaltuatsieotns ?t hat are incomplete and sought local datasets whenever possible. • Does the data show variability across the cityW? e included all census tracts that are within city boundaries and that overlap with city boundaries. Some datasets are relevant, high quality, and available at the census tract level, but do not show any variability across the city and are therefore not useful for the indices. The full list of indicators can be found below. The �irst table lists indicators that apply across the focus areas; subsequent tables show indicators by focus area. Appendix A.

We consolidated comments from the Jamboard activity and discussion to provide an overview of additional considerations for Cascadia to incorporate in the methodology. 1. For each sector, we had three primary questions: 2. Do the methodology and results resonate? 3. What might we be missing from our methodology? What other caveats and considerations should we keep in mind? Key discussion themes for each sector are in the table below. Appendix C.

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Executive Summary Seattle, along with the broader Puget Sound region, is already experiencing climate change impacts and climate-related hazards, such as warmer temperatures, more frequent extreme heat events, prolonged wild�ire smoke episodes, extreme precipitation, and sea level rise. All of these impacts are projected to worsen under a variety of future climate scenarios, though how bad they will get is dependent on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the ability to improve adaption options for City systems and communities.

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment These climate change impacts and hazards will have multiple transformative impacts for Seattle—such as affecting the local economy, exacerbating public health disparities, stressing infrastructure systems, affecting community wellbeing and resiliency, and transforming local ecosystems and habitats. The burden of these impacts will be unevenly experienced across Seattle. Areas with less community services—such as grocery stores, parks, libraries, and transit options—often coincide with neighborhoods that were historically redlined and have a higher population of residents of color, non-English speaking residents, and older adults, and these areas will also be more vulnerable to climate-related extreme events. Aging infrastructure systems will be more vulnerable to climate-related hazards, as they are less able to mitigate climate-related hazards or cope with extreme events. Many systems are inherently connected so impacts to one system will often cascading impacts to other systems, services, and assets. While Seattle’s systems and assets are fairly resilient to the impacts of climate change, consequences and damages are still very likely to happen during and after extreme events.

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Introduction Urgency to Address Climate Vulnerability Climate change and climate-related extreme events are already affecting the residents, industries, natural systems, and infrastructure of Seattle in multiple ways. Coastal areas and shorelines – such as Alki Beach and South Park – have seen more frequent and more intense coastal �looding. Low lying areas – such as the Duwamish Valley and Georgetown area – are seeing more extreme urban �looding. Interactions between coastal and riverine �looding, such as the tidally in�luenced riverine �looding during the 2022 King Tide �looding in South Park, illustrate how compound events may lead to extreme events that exceed model projections. The consequences of some climate impacts are ampli�ied by industrialization and historical disinvestment, leaving some residents and businesses with fewer resources and lower capacity to withstand climate-related hazards and extreme events. Additionally, there have been unprecedented climate-related extreme events and impacts. Wild�ire smoke days were historically rare occurrences in Seattle, yet have become an annual occurrence since 2015, affecting outdoor workers’ health and the safety of outside activities. The 2021 heat dome event – where temperatures in June reached an unprecedented 108°F, are associated with hundreds of premature deaths across Washington state, and affected the city’s infrastructure systems in a myriad of ways – is partially attributable to climate change (Philip et al., 2022; White et al., 2023). The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6) reaf�irms the urgency to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change through robust and comprehensive action. The IPCC AR6 projects that many climate change impacts will continue to worsen with the current emissions trajectory, and that adaptation will be necessary across multiple sectors and geographies to avoid some of the worst impacts. Additionally, there will be “climate surprises” – or impacts that we have not yet anticipated – that will occur in the future (Lee et al., 2023). In response to the urgency to respond and address climate change, the state of Washington has enacted multiple policies and programs to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The Washington Department of Commerce is developing guidance for counties and cities to leverage climate mitigation and adaptation bene�its into comprehensive planning – a planning process used to guide local governments to invest in development and growth in sustainable ways.

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Purpose The City of Seattle’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) is a detailed assessment of how climate change is already affecting and will continue to affect the community wellbeing, economy, health, infrastructure, and natural systems of the city. While this CVA illuminates how climate change impacts a variety of sectors, this CVA is not intended to be a comprehensive assessment of all risks and hazards to such systems. For example, this CVA is not meant to be used as a hazards risk assessment for emergency planners or an economic risk assessment for economic development professionals. Rather, this CVA is used to identify ways that climate change has already affected and will continue to affect various One Seattle Comprehensive Plan systems and complement other types of risk assessments. This CVA was developed to inform the , or the City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan update, which will guide City policies and decisions on housing and job development and how the City invests in transportation, utilities, parks, and other public assets. This CVA can support the development of speci�ic climate-related policies in the One Seattle Comprehensive Plan to build resilience and reduce vulnerabilities from climate change across the city’s communities, geography, and systems. Additionally, the CVA can support the implementation of One Seattle Comprehensive Plan’s policies to ensure that investments are focused in areas that are more vulnerable to the current and future impacts of climate change. This CVA was funded by the Washington Department of Commerce capacity building grants to support local governments across the Washington state to develop and integrate climate cChalnigme adaapttaetio nV anud mlnitigeatrioan pboliicliiets yint oF threair rmespeectwive oCormkpr ehensive Plans. Climate vulnerability is the propensity or the predisposition to be negatively affected by climate change and climate-related hazards. Exposure, sensitivity, and adaptative capacity are the components that in�luence a system’s vulnerability to climate change. This assessment uses the following de�initions of climate exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive • Exposure capacity to better understand climate vulnerabilities for this CVA (Figure 1): is the degree to which a system is exposed to climate hazards.

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Exposure and sensitivity increase vulnerability, while adaptive capacity helps to decrease Figure 1. Climate Vulnerability Framework vulnerability. Adaptive Exposure Sensitivity Vulnerability Capacity Notes: The components of climate vulnerability are exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (Lee et al., 2023). Climate vulnerability is in�luenced by environmental, institutional, economic, and cultural factors. Communities that have been historically marginalized and excluded from decision- making processes based on their race, income, age, gender identity or expression, or other factors are likely to have elevated exposure, sensitivity, and/or lower adaptive capacity as a result. Identifying and addressing structural inequities is an important step in documenting Sclimtartue vculnteurabrielity oandf btuihldiinsg a mAorse sreseilisenst Semattlee fnor tal l.

The project team developed a potential list of sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators by referencing comparable vulnerability assessments, such as those from the City of Redmond (WA) and Los Angeles County (CA), as well as a technical guidance document from the University of Notre Dame (BERK Consulting, Inc.; Perteet; The Watershed Company; UW Climate Impacts Group, 2022; LA County, 2021; Chen, et al., 2015). After developing an initial list, the project team solicited additional potential indicators and data sources from City staff members and through additional data requests to City staff. • Is the data relevant? The project team then vetted the potential indicators by asking the following questions: The project team used indicators that are as recent as possible and that have clear connections to climate change.

Some datasets are relevant, high quality, and available at the census tract level, but do not show any variability across the city and are therefore not useful for the indices. Once the project team selected indicators, we normalized each dataset into indices to allow for comparability between census tracts. The equation weights exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity equally in the analysis to calculate a vulnerability index (see equation below) for each census tract.

Traditional risk or vulnerability assessments typically treat hazards independent from one another. However, systems – social, economic, and infrastructure systems – are interconnected. Thus, climate change impacts to one system will inevitably have cascading or compounding effects across multiple systems (May et al., 2018). However, many of these impacts are dif�icult to model or predict because of their interdependent nature, leading to potential “surprises” – or events and impacts that fall outside the scope of climate models (Kopp et al., 2017). Currently, there are limitations in how to quantitatively evaluate cascading and compounding impacts from these extreme events (Kopp et al., 2017). There is lag-time Approach and Methodology | 16",
        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment between the occurrence of extreme events and documentation of these events in the peer- reviewed literature base (Roesch-Mcnally et al., 2020). Thus, to assess the compounding and cascading impacts from climate change, we rely on a case study approach and a mix of sources including peer-reviewed literature, media reports, and City plans and documents. We used two different case studies to illuminate the new and emerging ways climate change is affecting local communities, which include: 1) the 2021 heat dome event, and 2) the 2022 King Tide �looding that coincided with a historic winter storm and atmospheric rCiveirt eyve nSts. t aff and Community Partner Engagement City Staff Engagement The City convened City staff to guide the CVA process.

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Climate Change Trends and Projections The climate of western Washington has been rapidly changing since the 1900s (Mauger et al., 2015; May et al., 2018). The region has experienced warmer air temperatures, reduced mountain snowpack, increasing wild�ire risk, sea level rise, and changing precipitation patterns that affect the region’s communities, economies, and infrastructure systems. The climate in the Paci�ic Northwest is affected by natural climatic patterns and processes— such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)—that can make some impacts more pronounced in individual years. The following sections provide an overview of various climate change impacts and how Fexploosuore dto ithnesge i mpacts are unevenly distributed across the City of Seattle. Historically, �looding has affected various parts of Seattle and is one of the most costly and destructive types of climate-related events (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2019). Seattle experiences three types of �looding: riverine �looding, coastal �looding, and urban or pluvial �looding. For example, areas around Longfellow and Thornton creeks experience riverine �looding, areas along West Seattle’s shores experience coastal �looding, and areas along Madison Valley experience urban �looding (Figure 2). Climate Change Trends and Projections | 19",
        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 2. FEMA 100-year and 500-year Flood Zones in Seattle Notes: This map shows sea level rise of 3.1 feet (using a 1% likelihood scenario and including storm surge) in the Duwamish Valley of Seattle. There are several blocks along the river shown to be inundated with seawater (City of Seattle, 2022). Flooding impacts can be exacerbated by impervious surfaces, often associated with development and industrialization. The coincidence of low-lying areas – or areas where water is likely to pool and collect in the city – with areas of more impervious surface coverage can lead to ampli�ied �looding risks, especially during heavy rain events that increase volume and �low into these areas. Impervious surfaces are correlated with pluvial �looding in Seattle; systems with inadequate conveyance capacity will not be able to effectively cope with �looding events. Some areas, like the Duwamish Valley and South Park, experience a con�luence of �looding types, amplifying the �looding impacts and associated consequences (Figure 3). Historically redlined areas in Seattle generally have a higher extent of impervious surfaces (Conzelmann et al., 2022). Some of these areas, such as the Georgetown neighborhood, experience a signi�icantly higher risk of �looding than other low-lying areas, such as Montlake (Figure 3) (Risk Factor, 2020).

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 3. Low-lying Areas with Capacity-constrained Drainage and Impervious Surfaces that are at High-Risk of Urban Flooding Notes: The map indicates several areas in South Park, Georgetown, Rainier Beach, Sunset Hill, and Meadowbrook neighborhoods where low-lying areas with capacity-constrained drainage and impervious surfaces overlap, making it more likely for these areas to experience �looding after heavy rains. Low-lying areas are areas in Seattle that lie under 82 feet (25m) of elevation; capacity constrained systems layer from SPU; and areas of impervious surfaces are from the City of Seattle. These layers are used as proxy layers to assess current urban �looding risk (City of Seattle, 2022). Flooding risks will continue to affect Seattle. Areas that have historically �looded will �lood more often and new areas may experience infrequent �looding events in the future. All �looding types are expected to become more intense and more frequent, due to climate drivers such as sea level rise and extreme precipitation events, whose trends and impacts are documented in subsequent sections (Table 4).

Sea Level Rise Sea level rise is driven by a variety of factors related to global climate change, including ocean warming, thermal expansion of water as the ocean warms, and in�lux of water from melting ice sheets and glaciers (Sweet et al., 2022). Localized geologic processes in the Puget Sound region, such vertical land movement, can worsen or slow the effects of sea level rise (Miller et al., 2018). Relative sea levels in Seattle have already risen approximately 0.68 feet, or 8.2 inches, between 1899 and 2022 (Figure 4). During El Niño years, sea levels can rise another 7.9 inches in the region, increasing risks of coastal �looding (Sweet et al., 2022). Climate Change Trends and Projections | 22",
        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 4. Relative Sea Level Rise in Seattle, WA Notes. Plots show monthly mean sea levels without regular seasonal �luctuations from other atmospheric and oceanographic processes. The relative sea level trend is shown with a 95% con�idence interval. Value measurements are from NOAA Tide Gauge 9447130 in Seattle, WA. Sea levels are projected to rise across Seattle’s shorelines in the coming decades, though sea level rise will be variable due to local geological conditions such as the rate of vertical land movement (Miller et al., 2018). Downscaled sea level rise projections for Washington state use different likelihood scenarios that allow for planners to tailor efforts based on a variety of factors, including planning horizons and risk tolerance (Raymond et al., 2020). For this CVA, we have decided to use the 17 percent and 1 percent likelihood scenarios to illustrate a range of potential impacts associated with sea level rise in alignment with other jurisdictions across Puget Sound (Raymond et al., 2020). By 2050, it is projected that Seattle will experience sea level rise that will exceed 1.1 feet (17% likelihood scenario) to 1.6 feet (1% likelihood scenario) (RCP8.5). By 2100, it is very likely that sea level rise will exceed 3.2 feet (17% likelihood scenario) to 5.2 feet (1% likelihood scenario) (Table 5) Table 5.

When combined with the 100-year Puget Sound storm surge event, coastal �looding impacts in low-lying areas will be ampli�ied, and sea levels are likely to increase by an additional 3.1 feet (Table 6) (Yang et al., 2019).

While annual precipitation will continue to remain variable, there will be seasonal shifts in precipitation. Winter and fall precipitation are expected to increase and precipitation will increasingly fall as rain rather than snow.

While the magnitude of seasonal shifts in precipitation will vary, summer precipitation is predicted to decrease and winter precipitation is predicted to increase. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, total summer precipitation is projected to decrease by 13 percent by 2050 and 15.9 percent by 2080, and winter precipitation is projected to increase by 7 percent by 2050 and 10.6 percent by 2080. Under the SSP585 scenario, summer precipitation is projected to decrease by 14.2 percent by 2050 and 19.5 percent by 2080, and winter precipitation is set to increase by 5.3 percent by 2050 and 9.8 percent by 2080 (Figure 6) (Morgan et al., 2021). As winter precipitation volume increases, extreme precipitation events – many of which are driven by atmospheric rivers – are likely to be more intense (Slinskey et al., 2020). The magnitude of the average 25 year-storm is expected to increase by 13 percent by 2050 and 12 percent by 2090 (Raymond & Rogers, 2022).

Landslides are likely to occur in areas with steep slopes, such as in the Delridge and Interbay areas, especially in winter and spring months when heavy precipitation events typically occur (Strauch et al., 2019). Heavy precipitation, particularly over prolonged periods, can contribute to slope instability and failure (Strauch et al., 2018). Events like these will likely increase in frequency and intensity into the future, contributing to increased risks of landslides that cause damage and blockage to transportation routes, buildings, other infrastructure, and natural areas across the city (Figure 7) (Strauch et al., Figure 7. Landslide Hazard Areas in Seattle 2019). Notes: This map shows potential landslide areas in the City of Seattle (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2019). LIQUEFACTION Sea level rise associated with climate change could magnify liquefaction risk during an earthquake (Figure 8). Liquefaction occurs when soil that is saturated with groundwater acts more like a liquid under the intense shaking of an earthquake. As sea level rises along the Seattle shoreline, water tables will also rise, increasing soil saturation and the likelihood and severity of liquefaction (Poitras et al., 2022). Increased urban �looding could especially amplify liquefaction risk during the winter. Conversely, lower water tables during projected temporary drought periods could reduce liquefaction risk during the summer. Climate Change Trends and Projections | 27",

While temperatures have generally been warming across the city, heat burden is not equally distributed across the city. Factors such as level of industrialization, impervious surface coverage, and tree canopy coverage – all of which are associated with land use and redlining policies – can increase heat burden, or the heat island effect, for some areas of Seattle (Conzelmann et al., 2022). Industrialized areas and historically redlined areas— such as Georgetown and Rainier Beach—can be almost 8°F warmer than other areas (Figure 10). Summertime maximum temperatures in Seattle is projected to increase by 6.3°F by 2050 and 10.5°F by 2100 under RCP8.5 relative to the 1980-2009 median, increasing the frequency of extreme heat days in the city (Raymond & M. Rogers, 2022). Additionally, the likelihood of a heatwave (i.e., when the “feels like” temperature is above 86°F) to last three consecutive days or longer, which is currently about 67 percent, will increase to 86 percent by 2050 (First Street Foundation, n.d.).

Climate “Surprises” Climate change models have limits in quantifying and predicting some climate change impacts and climate-related extreme events. While climate models provide insight into the range of possible futures, these models are limited by the fact that they do not encapsulate all types of processes, feedback loops, and factors that affect global and local climate. Thus, there are some types of impacts and extreme events that may fall outside the limit of model outputs – or climate “surprises” (Kopp et al., 2017). Some recent examples of “surprises” in Seattle includes the occurrence of wild�ire smoke events each year, the severity of �looding associated with some King Tide events (i.e., 2022 King Tide �lood events), and the 2021 heat dome event that saw temperatures exceed 100°F over multiple consecutive days.

The de�inition of community wellbeing can vary across and within communities, and can be subjective (e.g., how happy does a person feel within their community?) or objective (e.g., does a person or group have access to services and amenities that can allow them to �lourish?) (Atkinson et al., 2017). Proximity and access to amenities have been shown to lead to bene�icial health and wellbeing outcomes, including improved physical and mental health (City of Seattle, 2016). This CVA focuses on community exposure to climate change impacts and how access, or lack of access, to various community amenities and services – such as healthcare services, grocery stores, and shade – will positively or adversely affect local communities in preparing for and coping with the impacts of climate change. Community services and amenities are both at risk from climate change and supportive of communities’ adaptive capacity to prepare for, cope with, and be resilient to climate change. For example, access to amenities and services such as parks and open spaces and grocery stores can provide spaces for recreation and healthy food options, respectively. However, extreme events such as �looding or heat waves can disrupt access or make it more dif�icult for residents to access these services, likely leading to increased burden for those who already have limited access these services (e.g., those without cars, those in sensitive population groups, or older residents).

Race & Social Equity Sensitivity Race and social equity considerations – such as Index health and socioeconomic disadvantages – increase vulnerability and risk to climate impacts and how a community adapts and copes before, during, and after these events. Tree Canopy Adaptive Capacity Lack of tree canopy coverage increases the relative vulnerability and risk of heat-related impacts for the residents and workers that reside in these areas Critical Facilities Adaptive Capacity People who have less access and are further from critical facilities – or facilities that provide important community services – increase vulnerability for frontline communities to access these services during extreme weather events. Climate impacts – such as extreme heat and urban �looding – will disrupt access and level of service for a variety of community amenities, including parks and open spaces, grocery stores, and critical facilities. These disruptions often exacerbate existing health and socioeconomic disparities and affect the ability of residents to respond and recover from climate impacts and extreme events.

Finally, parks and urban forests can increase bene�icial mental health outcomes – such as reducing stress and anxiety, increasing happiness, and improving cognitive function (Bratman et al., 2019). While these amenities strengthen community resilience, impacts to these resources will also have outsized impacts on communities that may have less access to these amenities in the �irst place. Climate impacts to parks and urban forests can compound existing vulnerabilities to climate change for surrounding communities. Impacts such as �looding or heatwaves can limit access to parks, undercutting City efforts to make parks more accessible and improve community wellbeing. Disruption to park and urban forest access – even for a limited time – can contribute to an acute decrease in community wellbeing if residents are unable to access key features and amenities and potentially contribute to an overall decrease in community wellbeing, especially if there is associated post-trauma lower Duwamish Valley stress after extreme events. Rainier Valley In particular, the (i.e., Georgetown, South Park and SODO) and areas will have higher relative vulnerability due to lack of access to parks and open spaces and relatively lower tree canopy coverage than other parts of the city (Figure 13). The lack of robust tree canopy coverage increases the risk of heat-related impacts – such as heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and mortality – for the people who reside or work in these areas (Isaksen et al., 2014; Schramm et al., 2020). As urban forests are stressed due to heat, low water availability, and development, park access and urban tree health are expected to worsen, potentially exacerbating health disparities. Additionally, many of these neighborhoods are considered higher equity priority areas, which means that a relatively large portion of their population are BIPOC, have socioeconomic disadvantages (e.g., low income, no college degree), or have higher rates of health challenges (e.g., higher rate of asthma) (City of Seattle Of�ice of Planning & Community Development., 2021). These same factors that already make these neighborhoods higher priority areas also make these neighborhoods more sensitive to the impacts of extreme heat. Furthermore, many of these neighborhoods that have less tree canopy coverage, access to parks, and experience more extreme urban heat island effects are areas that have been historically redlined (Hoffman et al., 2020). Areas t°hat received 2 Home Owners’ Loan Corporation grades of C or D – such as the Duwamish Valley area, Rainier Beach, Central District – have average temperatures that are 3.6-4.0 F warmer than the rest of the city (Figure 14). Additionally, households in these areas are more likely to have limited or no access to personal vehicles, compounding disparities in ability to access amenities and services like parks and health care. 2 The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) was created during the New Deal Era and created a neighborhood ranking system, now known as “redlining”. Deve lopers and appraisers assigned grades that ranger from A to D, where A grades were considered “best”, and C and D grades were considered “declining” or “hazardous”. Generally, neighborhoods with C and D grades – now referenced as formerly redlined neighborhoods – received these grades because of they had higher proportions of Jewish, Asian, Latino/x, and Black families. Because of these grades, many cities diverted public investments – such as quality schools, grocery stores, health care facilities, parks, among others – away from these neighborhoods and sited facilities – such as industrial facilities – within or near these neighborhoods. Disparities in health outcomes and wealth accumulation of residents in formerly redlined neighborhoods are associated with these historical policies and decisions.

The City of Seattle anticipates increased use of parks and open spaces (e.g., pools, beaches, community centers) during heat events, particularly in Equity & Environment Initiative (EEI) focus areas (Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability and Environment, 2017). Reducing climate risks to parks and urban forests – such as through investments in conservation and restoration, maintenance of tree canopy, and planting of heat-tolerant plants and trees – will simultaneously increase the adaptive capacity of parks and open spaces and the resiliency of the surrounding communities dependent on them (Seattle Parks and RCreictirceaal tFiaocni,l i2ti0es2 2 ).

Food security means that an individual or community has the resources necessary to acquire food, which includes affordable food prices and proximity to food amenities and retail outlets. Food access can increase the adaptive capacity and resilience of communities to extreme events; however, impacts from climate change can also exacerbate food access inequities, increasing the vulnerability of communities with less access to food or that are more cost burdened. Based on a survey conducted by Puget Sound Sage, limited access to healthy and affordable food is a top climate change-related concern for communities along the Duwamish River (i.e., South Park) and Rainier Valley (Sage, 2020).

However, some neighborhoods lack grocery stores within a half mile, including areas in , the , and parts of that have over a third of their households living more than 0.5 miles away from the closest grocery store(Figure 13). Additionally, a community’s social and cultural norms can inform food access and distribution channels. For example, communities with P-Patches can provide a space to grow fresh and healthy foods for surrounding households. Cultural gardens, like the Yes Farm or the Danny Woo International District Community Garden, aim to empower speci�ic groups, like the Black community or the Asian and Paci�ic Islander communities, to steward and connect residents to culturally relevant food systems (City of Seattle, 2023).

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment groups, such as urban Native residents or immigrants and refugees, may rely on subsistence methods, such as harvesting or �ishing, within or around the city (City of Seattle, 2023). Flooding and extreme events are projected to be more frequent and intense, which will affect food access across the city, particularly in the Duwamish Valley area, where there is a lower median household income, poorer air quality and associated health outcomes, and more children who require nutritious foods for their growth and development (City of Seattle, 2016). These events can exacerbate existing food access inequities for these neighborhoods. For example, �lood events can disrupt access to local grocery stores by reducing transit options for residents and affect the hours of local food businesses, placing additional burden on households with limited access to personal cars or residents that walk or bike to stores. Additionally, coastal �looding impacts can affect the access of harvesting and gathering sites of residents reliant on subsistence foods (Figure 13). The City has many ongoing programs and community-led efforts that address gaps in access to food retailers that promote affordability, individual and cultural preferences, and food quality and variety (City of Seattle, 2016). For example, the City supports emerging local businesses to �ill the healthy food gap by connecting them to City resources and implements alternative efforts to �ill the healthy food gap, such as establishing a farmers’ mEacrkoet inn Sooumth Piacrk. Vulnerability to Climate Change Introduction to Local Economy While economic activity contributes to climate change, climate change also affects the economy – both at micro and macro scales. Climate change is expected to have direct and consequential effects across the regional economy, particularly for natural resource economies and outdoor-based industries (Lee et al., 2023). Climate change and extreme events can directly affect crops, infrastructure, and labor through increased exposure to various climate-related hazards. These direct effects will have indirect impacts across economic systems. For example, impacts to local produce may lead to reduced revenue for agricultural producers; lost labor hours due to extreme event may lead to less spending power within the community; or repeated exposure to �looding for homes and businesses can lead to increase in insurance premiums or affect property values (Lee et al., 2023). Furthermore, a strong local economy also depends on things indirectly affectCeodm bym culinmitayte cAhmanegneit, iiensc launddin Wg ceollmbmeiunngi ty amenities that support a thriving local workforce, such as affordable cost of living, parks and open spaces, and good quality of life (see section).

Additionally, the Port of Seattle acts as an important hub for regional, national, and international commerce, serving as an important hub for commercial �ishing industries, tourism, and a part of many different supply chains. The city also has relatively low unemployment rates compared to the rest of Washington state and the U.S., and average wages in Seattle are relatively higher than average wages in the country (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023). However, like many other urban areas, the city of Seattle’s wealth and economic assets are inequitably distributed, and communities that were historically redlined and BIPOC residents generally have relatively less income, accumulated wealth, and higher unemployment rates (Oliver & Shapiro, 2019). In Seattle, climate change is likely to have both direct and indirect effects on the local economy, affecting land use and availability, transportation routes (both commercial and commuting), utilities and associated costs, natural resource commodities, and public health. These impacts will affect Seattle’s economy in a myriad of ways. Some businesses will be damaged or forced to close during extreme weather events or will suffer reduced foot traf�ic due to disruption of transit and walking routes. Extreme heat events will result in lost labor hours across the city, with consequences for businesses and for workers’ wages. Storms, heat, and �looding will likely disrupt transportation systems, with repercussions for both employees’ commutes and business supply chains. Business’ costs will increase – whether due to scarce materials, rising insurance costs, or higher energy demand for cooling.

Climate change has affected and will affect Seattle’s workforce in multiple ways. Over the past 30 years, workers in these climate-exposed industries have made up 4.5 percent to 5.6 percent of all workers in King County, representing 5.4 percent of workers in 2022 (United States Census Bureau, 2022). In 2019, there were approximately 25,851 workers who worked in climate-exposed industries – such as natural resource industries (e.g., agriculture, forestry, �ishing, and hunting) and outdoor-based industries like construction – in the city, encompassing 4.4 percent of the regional labor force (Table 11).

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment industries are considered to be climate-exposed because the industries themselves provide goods and/or services that will be directly affected by climate change (e.g., natural resources) or the workers will be occupationally exposed to climate change because of the outdoor nature of their work (Got Green & Puget Sound Sage, 2016; Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability and Environment, 2017). During extreme anomaly events—such as the 2021 Heat Dome event—workers who we2r0e 2n1o tH ine actli Dmoamtee-e Expveonsetd industries, such as service workers or �irst emergency responders, were also affected by business closures or responding to emergency calls (see section). Thus, estimates of lost labor hours likely underestimate the true cost of climate impacts on the workforce. Extreme heat and other climate-related hazards will result in lost wages for climate- exposed workers.With 2°F of additional warming relative to the 1986-2005 average, which is expected by the 2050s under the RCP8.5 scenario, the city will see approximately 25,851 lost labor hours, or the equivalent of $595,090 (2017 dollars) in lost wages per year, due to 3 extreme heat for climate-exposed occupations. Any impacts to local wages – whether acute or chronic – will decrease the spending power of households, affecting potential market demand for goods and services provided by local businesses. Additionally, increased ambient temperatures are correlated with additional workplace injuries, (Page & Sheppard, 2016) and communities with more residents who work in outdoor occupations—such as areas like RainierP Vuabllleicy ,H Heiaghltlhine, Duwamish Valley, and Georgetown areas—have higher rates of heat-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits than other communities (see section) (Riley et al., 2018).

All commuters are likely to experience some kind of impact due to extreme weather; those most at risk of negative health impacts will be those who walk, bike, and use transit to get to work. In particular, there is a large commuter base concentrated in the Downtown and University District areas (Figure 17) Before the COVID- 19 pandemic, over one third of workers in Seattle traveled to get to work using transit (20.5%), walking (10.8%), or another method (4.7%) such as biking.

These health disparities have resulted from a variety of factors, including access to care, socioeconomic conditions, environmental conditions, linguistic barriers, and historical policies such as redlining. Climate change will affect public health in a myriad of ways, such as exacerbating existing public health risks and introducing new types of health consequences for residents. For example, extreme heat events have led to increases in hospital room visits in King County and Seattle (Isaksen et al., 2014, 2016).

Physical health will be affected in multiple ways due to climate change. Heat-related injuries and deaths are expected to increase across all climate scenarios. Increases in wild�ire smoke will affect respiratory-related illnesses. Environmental health challenges – such as presence of mold – will worsen as �looding events become more severe and Extreme Heat frequent. Vector-borne diseases are expected to become more prevalent. Extreme heat accounts for more deaths annually than any other single weather event- related hazard in the Paci�ic Northwest (Isaksen et al., 2016; US Department of Homeland SecurEixtyt,r 2e0m2e2 )H. eSautmmertime maximum temperatures in Seattle will continue to increase by 6.3°F by 2050 and 10.5°F by 2100 under RCP8.5 scenario (Raymond & Rogers, 2022) (see section). King County already experiences an in�lux of emergency room visits and heat-related mortality during hot days and mortality is expected to increase for everyone in Seattle, (Isaksen et al., 2016). For every 1°F of warming, heat-related mortality in King County is expected to increase an average of 1.83 percent for all age groups. However, older adults will be disproportionately affected, as their heat-related mortality is expected to increase from 2.3 to 22.3 times the average (Isaksen et al., 2014). In addition to older adults, groups such as people with chronic medical conditions – such as cardiovascular, cerebral, or respiratory diseases – and children under the age of �ive are more sensitive to heat exposure, even for short periods (Antonia et al., 2018). Residents who live in older housing structures are also more sensitive to extreme heat, as older housing units are likely to have less insulation that lets in the hot ambient air while preventing retention of any cool air indoors. Additionally, types of outdoor workers – such as construction, agriculture, and emergency response – that are considered “climate- exposed” are more likely to experience health impacts from occupational exposure to hazards such as extreme heat, wild�ire smoke, �looding, and poor quality.

Some environmental health hazards, such as mold, are expected to become more common as �looding becomes more frequent, leading to health impacts such as aggravation of asthma or other respiratory-illnesses, allergy symptoms, rashes, and infections (Paudel et al., 2021).

Access to parks and open spaces has been shown to have positive mental health bene�its by providing opportunities for people to de-stress with physical recreational activity and enjoy green spaces, which can increase happiness (Bratman et al., 2019; Crimmins et al., 2016). However, park access is inequitable across Seattle. For example, while the Duwamish Valley has access to parks, those parks are about half the size of the average City park and are harder to access due to reduced transit infrastructure (e.g., walkable sidewalks, bus routes) (City of Seattle, 2016). Social cohesion can improve a community’s adaptive capacity, as more connected and socially cohesive communities often fare better during and after natural disasters; more speci�ically, social cohesion can improve cooperation, which can increase the resilience immediately after natural disasters (Cherng et al., 2019). Despite high exposure and sensitivity to public health impacts of climate change, neighborhoods such as the Duwamish and Rainier Valley areas also have a strong history of social and civic organization that can facilitate community and social cohesion, increasing their resilience.

Shifts in winter precipitation will affect �low volume and timing, as peak �lows are expected to increase in winter months and decrease in summer months, where energy demand is growing (Mauger & Won, 2020). Despite these impacts, Seattle’s hydropower supply is generally resilient to changes in snowpack and peak �lows due to water storage management that can manage �lows to hydroelectric facilities, the diversity and redundancy of SCL hydroelectric facilities, and the ability to offset electricity shortfalls with purchases from other utilities, such as the Bonneville Power Administration and BC Hydro (Raymond, 2013). While the city’s hydroelectric sources are generally resilient, extreme droughts can affect the water supply and energy reliability for the entire state (Turner et al., 2022) (Figure 21).

Underground and overhead transmission wires can be weakened or damaged and experience operational issues if inundated (Energy Networks Association, 2018). Additionally, overhead transmission and distribution lines can be damages during winter storms, where high winds can cause tree falls that damage overhead lines. Flooding can also lead to high voltage equipment damage, de-energization, �ire, or catastrophic loss of substation equipment. While no substations are in the 100- or 500- year �loodplain or are exposed to 2050 sea level rise impacts (RCP8.5), some substations in low elevation areas or close to �lood zones – such as the Delridge, Union Street, Massachusetts, and South substations – may �lood as �looding risks change in the future (Figure 22). While the industry standard is for substations to be built one-foot higher than the historic 100-year �lood elevation, this may be insuf�icient as �looding becomes more intense due to climate change or if extreme �looding happens during compound extreme events, such as during the 2022 King Tides �looding (Costa & McAllister, 2017). Additionally, some of these substations in low-lying areas – such as the Massachusetts and South substations – are also in areas with high levels of impervious surfaces, which may make these substations particularly vulnerable to urban �looding impacts.

Inset maps indicate areas where the Delridge substation and Union Street Substation are near the 500-year �loodplain (City of Seattle, 2022; Miller et al., 2018; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2021; Roop et al., 2018; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2020). Several miles of transmission lines pass through landslide prone areas and there are some substations that occur or are in close proximity to these zones (Figure 23). However, large landslides are low probability but high consequence events, and parts of the city that historically experience more landslides, such as the West Seattle and Interbay areas, may be more prone to energy disruption due to landslides (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2019). SCL has taken measures to reduce the sensitivity and increase the reliability of their transmission system to landslides, such as building redundancy in transmission line routes and designing a higher energy load capacity for each transmission line to distribute more energy if other lines are damaged from hazards such as landslides. Additionally, the majority of SCL transmission towers are made of steel and concrete, making them less susceptible to damage during a landslide. Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 62",

Landside Risk to Transmission Lines and Substations Notes: This map overlays potential landslide areas with substations and transmission lines in Seattle. Two substations border potential landslide risk areas(City of Seattle, 2022; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2020). Extreme heat can increase power line sagging of overhead transmission lines and reduce the capacity and ef�iciency of overhead and underground transmission and distribution lines (Burillo et al., 2019; Fant et al., 2020). For example, by 2050, higher temperatures will reduce peak summertime load transmission capacity by 1.9 percent to 5.8 percent (Bartos et al., 2016). Additionally, warmer temperatures and extreme heat events can reduce the lifespan and ef�iciency of energy substations and transformers. Older energy assets are more sensitive to extreme heat and warmer ambient temperatures. For example, older transformers, which typically have a lifespan of about 40 years, are more likely to malfunction or overheat during heatwaves. While the city’s entire distribution and transmission systems will likely face impacts brought on from extreme heat, the most severe of these affects would be felt Cina sacraeadsi nogf tahned city that are more prone to urban heat island effect, such as areas in south Seattle and Georgetown (Figure 24).

The areas that have highest temperatures are SODO and the International District. There are two substations in this area and transmission lines that connect southern and northern Seattle (CAPA Strategies et al., 2021; City of Seattle, 2022). ENERGY DEMAND Historically, peak electricity demand is in the winter months for heating needs. However, as summers become warmers and heatwaves become more likely, energy demand is expected to increase in summer months as more residents rely on air conditioning (Raymond, 2013). Expected future population growth will also add increased energy demand across all seasons. Cooling degree days, or a measurement of the demand for cooling based on the daily average temperature compared to a baseline temperature for comfort (65°F), are expected to increase under all scenarios. Relative to 1980-2009, Seattle is expected to see projected increase in cooling degree days ranging from 430 to 493 days by mid-century under RCP8.5 (Figure 25) (Raymond & Rogers, 2022). Despite increases in future energy demand, energy supply is anticipated to meet this future demand. Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 64",

Transportation Infrastructure Systems Transportation is the largest source of GHG emissions in the city, as well as the U.S. (King County, 2022). While efforts to mitigate emissions in this sector will affect the energy sector, this sector is also at risk to the impacts of climate change. Flooding and landslides, driven by intense precipitation, have washed out roads and highways, and extreme heat is causing train tracks to warp and bridges to swell (Hernandez, 2021). In extreme cases these impacts can lead to closure or failure of transportation infrastructure, but even more moderate impacts will reduce the capacity, ef�iciency, and lifespan of assets. Due to its geographic nature of being on an isthmus – or a narrow body of land surrounded by water – Seattle’s transportation network is a critical backbone that connects the city’s neighborhoods and promotes commerce to the broader region. Residents rely on many types of transportation systems to move around the city, including roadways, buses, commuter rail, street cars, bErcidogneosm, tiucn Vnuellsn, earnadb fielirtryies.

Transportation systems are vulnerable to a variety of climate impacts (Figure 27). Some impacts, such as �looding and extreme heat, can have immediate effects on assets like ferry terminals, roads, and railways (Spector, 2019).

FLOODING Seattle’s transportation system is moderately vulnerable to climate change Generally, . Increasing �looding risks, driven by sea level rise, extreme precipitation, and land use, have already affected and will continue to pose challenges for Seattle’s transportation infrastructure. Repeated �looding – even minor �looding – can damage transit routes and systems, such as railways. Additionally, �looding can increase the likelihood of injury or death for passengers, increase congestion due to slower traf�ic, and disrupt trips for residents and freight commerce (Abenayake et al., 2022; Suarez et al., 2005). For example, the rail line running along Carkeek Park in Northwest Seattle and transit routes operating in the Thornton Creek area will face coastal and urban �looding impacts. The most profound impacts of �looding can be seen along the Duwamish and Downtown areas due to their low elevations, where �looding risks and high levels of impervious surfaces will likely affect transit routes, bridge stability, rail lines, and port facilities (Figure 28).

It shows that the rail line along Carkeek Park, transit routes in Thornton Creek, and many types of transportation infrastructure in the Duwamish and Downtown areas will be affected by �looding and sea level rise (City of Seattle, 2022; King County, n.d.; WSDOT, 2017). In addition to projected increase in �looding frequency and intensity, future sea level rise brought on by climate change will increase the exposure from �looding, storm surge and erosion transportation assets will face. Older assets – such as roads that have not been improved or retro�itted – are more prone to damage from repeated �looding events. Additionally, because of the lengthy processes to plan, permit, and retro�it or construct, there is a lower capacity of transportation systems to structurally prepare for future L�lAooNdDiSnLg IiDmEpSa cts. In addition to urban �looding, more frequent and intense extreme precipitation is associated with an increase in landslide risk. While minor landslides occur more frequently, they can temporarily block routes such as railways or roads. While a major landslide is unlikely to happen, it can lead to minor to major disruptions and potentially damage some transportation assets. Approximately 8.4 percent of Seattle is considered landslide-prone, particularly due to steep slopes (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2021). Some of Seattle’s transportation assets and routes are within or adjacent to potential landslide areas such as the BNSF railway in Northwest Seattle or light rail routes and stations – such as Rainier Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 68",

While rare, landslides have disrupted many of these routes, affecting regional commerce and commuting routes for residents and workers. Between 1890 to 2000, 1,326 landslides have been recorded in the Seattle areas with a large proportion of them being connected to heavy winter precipitation and snowfall events. Some of these landslides have damaged roadways and public rights of way. Landslide impacts to rail have been very prevalent, with over 540 passenger train service disruptions occurring in the Puget Sound corridor between 2015 and 2018 (Boiko-Weyrauch, 2018). Since 2011, two train derailments caused by landslides have also occurred on routes running from Seattle to Everett (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2021). As heavy precipitation events become more prevalent, landslide risks will also increase due to the saturation and destabilization of soil (Crowe, 2018). This increases the likelihood of landslides around some new areas, such as the I-5 and I-90 intersect around the Beacon Hill neighborhood (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2021).

Transportation systems are usually designed based off historic climate conditions and standards. However, as temperatures continue to increase with climate change, these design standards will no longer be suf�icient to prevent roadway ways from buckling and railways from bending.

There are a few key mechanisms that sea level rise and �looding will impact stormwater and wastewater facilities. Some wastewater facilities near coastal areas on Puget Sound and Elliott Bay are susceptible to inundation due to sea level rise and coastal �looding (Figure 33). Additionally, wastewater lines can also experience backups during �looding events, which can exacerbate �looding and bring cascading impacts to areas that are not directly experiencing �looding (Hummel et al., 2018).

In Discovery Park, the West Point Treatment Plant is in the 100-year �loodplain. The Carkeek Wet Weather Treatment Station also lies within the 100-year �loodplain, as do several combined sewer and runoff mainlines.

The West Point Treatment Plan has historically been impacted by �looding. In February 2017, high tides and heavy rains induced electrical circuit malfunction that shut down the operating system (Department of Ecology State of Washington, 2017). This led to the release of 235 million gallons of untreated wastewater – including 30 million gallons of raw sewage – into Puget Sound (Willmsen & Mapes, 2017). This event endangered staff at the facility and caused water quality impacts for local beaches and nearshore habitats as much as a year after the event (King County, 2018; Willmsen & Mapes, 2017). Events like this, even though are unlikely, may happen again as compounding weather events such as winter storms and heavy rains will be exacerbated by sea level rise and increasing intensity of atmospheric rivers. Aging water systems are generally more sensitive to climate change impacts, and many combined systems were designed to convey �lows based on historic precipitation records rather than future climate data (Lall et al., 2018).

Seattle’s drainage system is also at risk of damage from landslides. While all underground utilities are vulnerable to landslides, drainage systems are even more so due to their proximity to slopes (Seattle Of�ice of Emergency Management, 2019). Several stormwater facilities and pump stations, as well as several combined sewer and stormwater mainlines are in potential landslide risk zones (Figure 36).

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Natural Systems’ Vulnerability to Climate Change There are many natural systems – including urban forests, wetlands, rivers and creeks, and shorelines – in Seattle that provide a multitude of environmental bene�its and ecosystem services. For example, urban forests can provide shade for residents and habitat for birds and wildlife. Riparian areas can provide a natural �lood buffer that protects residents and infrastructure while also providing critical habitat for salmon, a Treaty-protected species for regional Tribes. This section evaluates the vulnerability to climate change of Seattle’s natural systems, including Seattle’s watersheds, habitat for salmon, urban tree canopy and green spaces, and 5 Watersheds environmental ly critical areas. A watershed is a basin of land that funnels rain and snow from higher elevation to lower elevation. This precipitation eventually collects in a shared waterway, such as a stream, river, or lake. Watersheds provide important terrestrial and aquatic habitat for wildlife, but conditions within watersheds can also impact �lood risk, drinking water quality, and hydropower availability for communities in and adjacent to them. Climate change disrupts the spatial and temporal distribution of water within watersheds, impacting both natural ecosystems and human-made infrastructure. The city relies on two large watersheds, the Cedar River Municipal Watershed and South Fork Tolt Municipal Watershed, for its drinking water supply and a small portion of its hydroelectric power (Raymond, 2013). Cedar River supplies 70 percent of Seattle’s drinking water, reserved in Chester Morse Lake and the Lake Youngs Reservoir, and has a hydropower capacity of 30 megawatts (MW). Jointly, the reservoirs have a storage capacity of approximately 14.5 billion gallons of water (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). South Fork Tolt supplies the remaining 30 percent of Seattle’s drinking water and provides a hydropower capacity of 16.8 MW. The South Fork Tolt Reservoir has a storage capacity of 18.3 billion gallons (Raymond, 2013).

Although Seattle is not projected to need a new water supply before 2060, seasonal drawdowns are expected under climate change. Hydropower capacity could also be impacted as a result. The following sections discuss climate impacts to regional watersheds – such as the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt Watersheds – that affect regional water supply and urban watersheds within the city, such as Thornton and Longfellow Creeks as well as the lower Duwamish River. Figure 37. April 1st Snowpack at Drought Levels Under RCP8.5 by 2050 Notes: This �igure shows regional changes to snowpack, which are likely to affect water availability to the city of Seattle. It shows that most areas are likely to experience decreased snowpack and several areas are 100 percent likely to have 75 percent less snowpack – which is considered drought levels – by 2050 under RCP8.5 (City of Seattle, 2022; Raymond & M. Rogers, 2022). REGIONAL WATERSHEDS AND WATER SUPPLY Snowpack and rainfall within the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt watersheds supply drinking water for the city. However, the snowpack and summer rainfall within these reservoirs have diminished due to warmer temperatures. In the Cedar River watershed, increases in spring �lows and decreases in summer �lows from 1949-2003 re�lect an earlier start to snowmelt and a reduced snowpack overall (Mote et al., 2018). This trend is consistent with watersheds throughout the western US: between 1955 and 2016, 92 percent of snow monitoring sites in the West experienced a decrease in mountain snowpack (Mote et al., 2018). Reduced snowpack contributed signi�icantly to the state- wide drought in 2015, which was re�lective of projected conditions in the 2050s (Marlier et al., 2017; Mote et al., 2016). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 79",
        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Seattle’s overall drinking water supply is projected to exceed demand through at least 2060 (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). However, demand may periodically exceed supply due to future shifts in temperature and precipitation regimes that affect water recharge in the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt watersheds (Raymond & Rogers, 2022). Further reduced snowpack, earlier snowmelt, and reduced summer rainfall will lead to temporary seasonal droughts that could impact drinking water availability for the city. This impact may be ampli�ied if customer water demand increases, especially during the hotter and drier summer months (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). By the 2050s, winter temperatures are projected to increase by 5.8°F under RCP8.5 in the Paci�ic Northwest relative to 1950-1999, leading to a 56-70 percent decrease in mountain snowpack throughout Washington by the 2080s (relative to 1916-2006 average; Snover et al., 2013). Many of the watersheds currently characterized as mixed snow-and-rain basins, including the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt watersheds, will shift to rain-dominant basins (<10% winter precipitation captured as snowpack) by the 2040s, under A1B (Snover et al., 2013). The likelihood of snowpack at drought levels (below 75% normal snowpack) will be 100 percent by 2050 for many of the areas within the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt watersheds (Figure 37).

The thick colored lines show the median among 10 climate models (Mauger et al. 2015). Even for areas with snowpack, warmer temperatures will lead to an earlier start to snowmelt each spring. For the Cedar River and Tolt watersheds, �lows are predicted to peak 4-9 weeks earlier than their 1917-2006 start dates by the 2080s (Figure 38) (Snover et al., 2013). Reduced and earlier snowmelt, coupled with predicted declines in summer precipitation rates, will lead to low summer stream �lows that are 34-44 percent less than their historic averages, under the same climate scenario (Snover et al., 2013). These changes are likely to impact water availability during the summer (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). Finally, while rare, there have been wild�ires within King County (King County Emergency Management, 2020). Fire risk is increasing for the western Cascades due to climate change and population growth that is expanding the wildland-urban interface. By the 2040s, the area burned is expected to triple (from 2,700 acres to 8,000 acres per year) relative to 1980-2006 in the western Cascades (Morgan et al., 2019). Wild�ires within the forested Tolt and Cedar watersheds will have impacts to water quality, supply, and habitats and could Reservoir Infrastructure damage various infrastructure assets. Water from the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt watersheds collects into a series of reservoirs and regulating basins and is then conveyed to customers through SPU-owned transmission and distribution systems. Operations at these reservoirs and the associated Masonry, Landsburg, Lake Youngs, and South Fork Tolt dams can be disrupted by both �looding and very low stream �lows, both of which are more likely to occur under climate change (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). Winter precipitation is projected to increase by about 6 percent west of the Cascades by 2050, relative to 1950-1999 levels under RCP8.5 (Morgan et al., 2021). Greater winter rainfall will contribute to increased winter �lood risk, which could impact reservoir capacity at Masonry and Tolt dams, affect hydropower infrastructure on the Cedar River and South Fork Tolt, and lead to �looding downstream (Raymond, 2013). However, the impact of increased �lows downstream of Cedar River and South Fork Tolt reservoirs has not been fully evaluated (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019a). Extreme precipitation can also decrease water quality by increasing turbidity, putting additional strain on water treatment facilities (Seattle Public Utilities, 2019b).

Low-lying areas that are already more prone to �looding, such as developed areas surrounding the Lower Duwamish (Figure 3), are especially at risk for greater riverine �looding. Flooding may also impact water quality, as sediment, nutrients, and pollutants accumulate in urban waterways. Excess sediment and particulate matter can suffocate the eggs, larvae, and adults of many �ish species, as well as invertebrates (Panthi et al., 2022). Increased nitrogen and phosphorous loading – which can be ampli�ied by runoff or sewer over�lows associated with development – cause hypoxic and anoxic conditions that can also lead to detrimental algal blooms that impact the entire aquatic ecosystem (Carey et al., 2013).

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Ecosystem Effects of Warmer Temperatures and Drought In the Seattle region, maximum summertime air temperatures are predicted to increase 6.3°F by 2050 (Raymond & Rogers, 2022). Bodies of water absorb heat as air temperatures rise and are therefore also projected to experience temperature increases under all scenarios, especially during the summer (Land Trust Alliance, 2023; Van Vliet et al., 2012). This will negatively impact cold water-adaptive native �ish, which have lower thermal tolerances. It may also bene�it nonnative, warm water-adapted species, who compete with native species (Steel et al., 2018). Additionally, dissolved oxygen concentrations are lower in warmer water, which is likely to cause additional stress and facilitate harmful algal blooms (Urgenson et al., 2021). Low summer stream�lows due to reduced summer precipitation and reduced shading from riparian trees will only exacerbate these problems for shallower waterways (Mantua et al., 2009). Seattle’s current focus on increasinUgr bcaanno Tprye ceo vCearn tohpryo uagnhdo uOtp tehne Sciptya cheass the potential to mitigate some of these effects, if focused on areas directly adjacent to urban Sea Level Rise and Nearshore Habitat waterways and associated estuaries (see section). Sea Level Rise Sea levels are projected to rise by 3.1 to 3.2 feet by 2100 under RCP8.5 (see section) (Roop et al., 2018). This increase, coupled with storm surge impacts (Yang et al., 2019), has the potential to eliminate or alter existing estuarine habitat in Seattle. Habitat responses to sea level rise are highly variable and depend on site-speci�ic factors, and there are currently no models for the Duwamish or Salmon Bay estuaries (Hall et al., 2023; Thorne et al., 2018). However, a recent model evaluating �ive other estuaries in Washington State, including three in Puget Sound, found that under a high sea level rise scenario (+4.6 feet, or +142 cm), 68 percent of existing wetland area will be submerged by 2110 (Thorne et al., 2018). This would signi�icantly limit wetland and nearshore habitat in and around Seattle, affecting the ability of habitat to mitigate coastal �looding risks, the survival of various shell�ish species that can improve water quality, and nearshore habitat that provide juvenile habitat for native �ish species. While unlikely, sea level rise could create new nearshore habitat farther up the shoreline (Thorne et al., 2018). Throughout its urban watersheds, the City of Seattle is already involved in infrastructure improvements and remediation work that can reduce the risk and consequences of increased �looding under climate change. Connecting �loodplains and improving drainage are two signi�icant goals. For example, the City is partnering with the Mid Sound Fisheries Enhancement Group, Green Seattle Partnership, and King County Noxious Weeds Program to create the new Lake City Floodplain Park, which will improve water quality, reduce erosion, and minimize future �looding in Thornton Creek. In the Longfellow Creek watershed, Seattle Public Utilities and the Seattle Department of Transportation are constructing natural drainage systems that will reduce �looding and pollution from storm runoff. The City is also re-imagining shoreline areas around the Duwamish River to reduce �looding risks while increasing community resiliency for neighborhoods like South Park.

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Salmon Habitat As an important ecological and cultural keystone species in the Paci�ic Northwest. Salmon connect predator, prey, and scavenger populations throughout their food webs, as their populations support freshwater invertebrates to marine mammals to terrestrial carnivores to avian scavengers. As a result, salmon are vital to the health and stability of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats in the Paci�ic Northwest, and any effect of climate change on salmon populations will be felt throughout these ecosystems. Salmon are also a critical First Food and cultural symbol for tribal communities, such as the Duwamish, Suquamish, Muckleshoot, Snoqualmie, Tulalip Tribes, and the city’s urban Native community. Their populations also sustain local, regional, and recreational �isheries. More broadly, salmon are woven into the fabric of the Paci�ic Northwest and the region’s sense of identity (May et al., 2018). However, salmon populations have been declining in Washington State since the late 1800s due to a variety of factors including dam construction, over�ishing, and development. Despite signi�icant investment in habitat recovery, protected hatcheries, and stricter �ishing regulations, populations continue to shrink, and many are now listed under the Endangered Species Act. Climate change represents another threat to an already-vulnerable species, along with over�ishing, reduced habitat availability, and loss of genetic diversity. Throughout its urban waterways and estuaries, the city provides critical habitat for many salmonid species, including federally threatened populations of Chinook, steelhead, and bull trout (City of Seattle, 2015). The city overlaps with two Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIA), the Lake Washington/Cedar/Sammamish Watershed (WRIA 8) and the Green/Duwamish and Central Puget Sound Watershed (WRIA 9). In Seattle, salmon migrate through the Ballard Locks, the Ship Canal, and Lake Washington or through streams that connect directly to Puget Sound, such as Pipers Creek. Maintaining and recovering viable salmon populations in Seattle and throughout WRIAs 8 and 9 requires preserving existing high-quality habitats that collectively support all phases of the salmon life cycle, from spawning and incubation through rearing and outmigration back into Puget Sound. Locally, Seattle’s waters are especially important during juvenile migration, when salmon transition from their natal freshwater rivers, tributaries, and creeks into the saltier Duwamish estuary and Salmon Bay, where they undergo physiological transformations that allow them to survive in a fully marine environment.

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 40. Climate Change Impacts on Paci�ic Salmon Notes: Figure depicts climate change impacts across the lifecycle of Paci�ic salmon (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2021). Generally, salmon are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, though there is some variability depending on salmonid species and life stage (Figure 40). Some of the key climate risks to salmon include: 1) increased winter peak �lows could disrupt salmon eggs and fry and expose juvenile salmon to increased pollutants and storm runoff as �lood risk increases in urban areas, 2) warmer water temperatures and associated dips in dissolved oxygen levels could directly or indirectly increase mortality rates of salmon in freshwater habitat, especially in the Lake Washington Ship Canal, and 3) sea level rise could eWliImNTinEaRt eP eExAisKt iFnLgO nWeaSr s hore habitat, which is crucial for out-migrating juvenile salmon.

Excess sediment and particulate matter can also suffocate sensitive salmon eggs and larvae (Panthi et al., 2022). Additionally, the potential increase in pollutant-laden storm runoff is a particular threat to salmon, which accumulate and retain PCBs and other toxins as they move up the food chain Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 86",

Urban Watersheds Warmer water temperatures will threaten the survival of �ish species with lower thermal tolerances (see section). Water temperatures consistently above 71.6°F (22°C) lead directly to salmon mortality, while temperatures above 59.0°F (15°C) can decrease reproductive success and increase infection rates from a variety of pathogens (Mantua et al., 2009; Urgenson et al., 2021; Water Quality Program, 2002). Because shallower and smaller bodies of water absorb heat more quickly than deeper and larger bodies of water, smaller creeks and the Lake Washington Ship Canal are especially susceptible to temperature increases (Mantua et al., 2009; Urgenson et al., 2021). As a result, they will have fewer cold-water refugia available for migrating salmon. High water temperatures in the ship canal already serve as barriers to migration for spawning adults. They also negatively impact out-migrating juveniles by allowing predators with higher thermal tolerances to �lourish (Mantua et al., 2009; WRIA 8, 2017). The WRIA 8 Salmon Recovery Council lists the current high temperatures and water quality within the Lake Washington Ship Canal as some of the greatest barriers to Chinook recovery within WRIA 8 (SWEAR ILAE 8V,E 2L0 R1I7S)E. AND NEARSHORE SALMON HABITAT Urban Watersheds Sea level rise in Seattle has the potential to limit critical habitat for juvenile salmon in the Duwamish and Salmon Bay estuaries (see section). Estuaries provide vital refuge and resources for juveniles during the smolt stage, when their bodies acclimate to higher saltwater concentrations and their growth rates accelerate before moving into marine waters as mature adults. The habitat diversity within estuarine nurseries provides the prey and nutrient abundance growing salmon need, while also offering protection from predators. Even without full submergence, rising sea levels could disrupt the temporal patterns of prey availability and productivity on which salmon have evolved to depend, as tides and wFRaEteSrH tWemATpeErRa tHuAreBsI TsAhiTft A wViAthILinA eBsItLuITarYi eAsN (DD aCvOisN eNt EaCl.,T 2IV02IT2Y) . Freshwater riparian and lake ecosystems provide critical overwintering refugia and rearing habitat for juvenile salmon, as well as spawning areas for adult salmon. These urban ecosystems also provide habitat for other wildlife, shade for surrounding residents, and opportunities for recreation. Climate-related hazards – such as extreme heat and �looding – interact with land use, placing some of these habitats at-risk. While the city is engaged in numerous initiatives to preserve, improve, and restore this freshwater habitat (WRIA 8, 2017). Physical Vulnerability Assessment | 87",

Urban tee canopy currently covers 28.1 percent of the city and has declined since the 2016 tree canopy assessment that showed about 28.6 percent coverage (Figure 42) (City of Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability & Environment, 2021). The majority of canopy cover is concentrated in residential neighborhoods on private land, where the City regulates and supports tree planting, maintenance, and removal (47%; Figure 43). An additional 23 percent of canopy exists on right-of-way property, including streets, sidewalks, and planting strips. While private property owners adjacent to right-of-way land are usually responsible for tree maintenance, various City departments also manage urban forests and permitting processes throughout the City.

Where canopy cover exists, trees cool their surrounding air through shade and evapotranspiration, cutting energy costs, reducing strain on the power grid, and mitigating the effects of urban heat islands (Safford et al., 2013). For every additional 13 percent of canopy coverage across several Seattle blocks, air temperature decreases by 0.5°F (City of Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability & Environment, 2021). In 2012, urban trees saved the City an estimated 43,000 mega-watt-hours of electricity and 1.6 million BTUs each year (Green Cities Research AUllirabnacne, W20a1te2r).s Shheaddse from trees can also insulate urban waterways from high temperatures that would otherwise negatively impact salmon and other �ish populations (see section). Public Health Urban canopies can play an additional role in intercepting precipitation and airborne pollutants, depending on species composition and season (see section). For both deciduous and coniferous trees, rainfall is distributed across the collective leaf surface area, slowing the rate at which it is absorbed into the ground below or is shed as runoff (Green Cities Research Alliance, 2012). Pollutants and particulate matter may also be deposited onto leaves and other tree surfaces, temporarily suspending them and improving air quality (Pace & Grote, 2020; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2008).

The longer and warmer summers predicted for the Paci�ic Northwest under climate change will negatively impact the city’s urban tree population through increased exposure to heat stress and pathogen pressure. The probability of Seattle experiencing a heatwave that lasts more than 3 days will increase from 67 percent to 86 percent by 2050 (First Street Foundation, n.d.). Climate Change Trends and HPreoajte scttrieosnsess trees primarily by causing dehydration, which is also more likely to occur under climate change due to reduced summer rainfall (see section). Heat can also interact with other drivers and increase the risk of tree mortality. For example, leaves tend to accumulate higher sugar concentrations in response to hot and dry conditions, which can make them more attractive to herbivorous insects (Safford et al., 2013). Longer summers may also translate into longer breeding seasons and accelerated population growth for existing pests, while an in�lux of new pest species from warmer climates will exert additional pressure on the city’s urban forests (City of Seattle USHrbIFaTnI FNoGr ePsRtrEyC CIPoIrTeA TTeIaOmN, 2P0A2T0T)E. RNS AND DROUGHT Reduced precipitation rates during the summer, coupled with an increase in winter rainfall and more intense winter storms, will also impact Seattle’s urban tree community. The greater likelihood of summer drought conditions will exacerbate heat and pathogen stress, and will affect both the recruitment of new, young trees into the urban tree population and the survival of existing older trees (City of Seattle Urban Forestry Core Team, 2020). Stressed trees are also more at risk of injury or being uprooted during winter precipitation events, as snow and ice accumulate on branches and as trees are exposed to severe wind (City of Seattle Urban Forestry Core Team, 2020; Safford et al., 2013). Additionally, �looding from these storms may waterlog soils and overwhelm root systems, leading to tree death. Ultimately, changing temperature and precipitation regimes will lead to range shifts for some trees that have historically been well-suited to the Seattle region, including many species of conifer (City of Seattle Urban Forestry Core Team, 2020). However, both the conifer and deciduous tree populations within the city are at risk. The current deciduous population is primarily composed of older, second-growth trees that are approaching the end of their natural lifespan, increasing their sensitivity to the stressors described above (City of Seattle Of�ice of Sustainability & Environment, 2021; City of Seattle Urban Forestry Core Team, 2020).

These systems both rely on one another and provide support. Thus, climate change impacts to one system will inevitably have cascading or compounding effects across multiple systems (May et al., 2018). However, many of these impacts are dif�icult to model or predict because of their interdependent nature, leading to potential “surprises” – or events and impacts that fall outside the scope of climate models (Kopp et al., 2017). Changes in the climate – such as warmer temperatures, decreased snowpack, sea level rise – have already led to direct impacts to some of our systems. However, not all effects occur in the same way or emerge at the same time, leading to impacts that propagate across timescales and contexts – or cascading impacts (Lawrence et al., 2020). Figure 44.

Additionally, climate hazards and extreme events that co-occur with other non-climatic extreme events – such as the COVID-19 pandemic – often amplify burdens and limit response options (Ford et al., 2022; Zang et al., 2021). For example, the 2.5 co-occurrence of dramatic increases in PM concentrations due to wild�ires in the Northwest were associated with increased exposure to COVID-19 incidences and deaths in the Puget Sound region (Zhou et al., 2021). Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests that there are cascading mental health implications when extreme events or disasters co- occur (Sugg et al., 2022). The city of Seattle has experienced multiple extreme events – such as the Heat Dome event in 2021. Currently, there are limitations in how to quantitatively evaluate cascading and compounding impacts from these extreme events. Additionally, there is lag-time between the occurrence of extreme events and documentation of these events in the peer-reviewed literature base (Roesch-Mcnally et al., 2020). Thus, these sections rely largely on media outlets, which often are the �irst to describe and report on extreme events and associated acute impacts. This section attempts to illuminate some of these potential impacts from cascading and 2com0p2oun1di nHg eevenatst u sDingo thme 20e21 hEeavt deomne tev ent as a case study. The city of Seattle – along with the rest of the Paci�ic Northwest, from northern California through southeast Alaska – experienced an unprecedented extreme heat wave from mid- June through early July, known as a heat dome event. The 2021 heat dome event – which was caused by a high-pressure system that blocked cool maritime winds and cloud formation – is a highly improbable and extreme weather event, even under current climate change conditions (White et al., 2023). However, the likelihood of an event like the 2021 heat dome was made more likely in part due to climate change (Philip et al., 2022; White et al., 2023). During the heat dome event, Seattle experienced temperatures that were 30°F warmer than the historical average for the same time period. Seattle set temperature records of 108°F, and there were three consecutive days with temperatures that exceeded 100°F. Other neighboring cities saw temperatures exceed 110°F (National Weather Service, 2021). Nighttime temperatures, which often serve as a period of cooling respite, were warmer than historical daytime averages for the same periods. Access to air conditioning or cooling centers during heat events is critical for a community’s ability to adapt to extreme heat impacts, particularly for sensitive populations.

There are likely Public Health Impacts additional impacts that have yet to be documented and/or are still emerging. The 2021 heat dome led to extremely signi�icant increases in heat-related illnesses and deaths (Schramm et al., 2020; Weinberger, 2022). Across the Paci�ic Northwest, heat- related emergency room visits were 69 times higher during the heat dome event compared to 2019 (Schramm et al., 2020) (Figure 46Figure 1). In King County, there were 30 heat- related deaths and many other heat-related injuries (Weinberger, 2022). The excess morbidity and mortality attributed to the heat dome event disproportionately affected older residents and low-income households without air conditioning capacity (Fisher et al., 2021; Schramm et al., 2020). Furthermore, emergency responders and emergency room staff were overextended in treating heat-related injuries and illnesses during the heat dome event, acutely stressing the regional health safety net after a period of chronic stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (Weinberger, 2022). Figure 46. Number of Emergency Department Visits for Heat-Related Illness in U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Region 10 (WA, OR, ID, And AK) and Nationwide (Excluding Region 10) from May 1–June 30, 2019 and 2021 Notes: The �igure shows elevated emergency department visits for heat-related illness in the Paci�ic Northwest and nationwide during the period of the 2021 heat dome event (Schramm et al., 2020).

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment the rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality for these groups (Popovich & Choi- Schagrin, 2021). Preliminary research is beginning to document the mental health toll – such as increased anxiety – of the heat dome event on residents across the Paci�ic Northwest (Bratu et al., 2022). Additional mental health consequences – both acute and chronic mental health illnesses – are likely to continue emerging as scholarship around extreme heatwaves continues to evolve. For example, evidence suggests associations between heatwaves with domestic violence, abnormal birth outcomes, adverse maternal health outcomes, and self- harm and suicide (Cil & Cameron, 2017; Sanz-Barbero et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2018). As of yet, no research has been conducted on the community health outcomes associated Infrastructure Impacts with the 2021 heat dome event. The heat dome event also had dramatic impacts on the city of Seattle’s infrastructure systems. Across the greater Seattle area, there were at least �ive instances of pavement buckling on I-5 and I-90 that required maintenance from WSDOT responders (Crowe, 2021) (Figure 47). The City also had to spray cool water on the city’s moveable steel bridges (Crowe, 2021), as extreme heat can expand the joints that connect two bridge spans (Palu & Mahmoud, 2019). Additionally, public transit agencies such as Sound Transit had to implement slow orders to monitor rail tracks, which can expand during extreme heat events, and the overhead catenary system, which can sag and loosen during extreme heat events (Whitely Binder et al., 2013). These collective impacts to the transportation system disrupted traf�ic, increased congestion, and increased occupational exposure to extreme heat conditions for maintenance workers and responders. While other localities around Washington experienced energy blackouts and brownouts due to high energy demand for cooling (Geranios & Selsky, 2021), the city generally has capacity to accommodate additional energy loads during peak demand times (Alexander et al., 2022; Raymond, 2013). This allows greater resiliency during events such as the heat dome. However, as additional changes to the climate affect regional snowpack and precipitation patterns, the timing of energy supply for hydroelectric sources may be insuf�icient to meet future energy demand (Raymond, 2013), especially during extreme events (e.g., 2021 heat dome) that that require systems to be resilient and continue to function at increased capacity.

Economic Impacts The heat dome event also had many acute, and likely chronic, economic consequences for residents and businesses. Many restaurants in Seattle had to temporarily shut down due to excessive heat and insuf�icient ventilation or cooling capacity for its workers (Figure 48) (Pae, 2021). Many other workers and businesses – from factory workers to educators to construction workers – had work temporarily halted due to the extreme heat (Layne, 2E0co2n1o).m Thicis V lueldn teor laobsitl ilatybor hours and associated wages for these workers. Lost wages associated with extreme heat are projected to continue increasing in the future (see section). Financial instability – even short-term instability – from the heat dome event has also been linked to additional anxiety for residents in the Paci�ic Northwest (Bratu et al., 2022). Additional health burden for workers exposed to extreme heat may place increased �inancial burden on these individuals, especially for workers that lack health insurance coverage from their employers (SE.c Loanwormenicc eV, u2l0n2e1r)a. bAidlidtyitionally, small businesses will have more dif�iculty recovering revenue and operational ef�iciency due to economic shocks like the heat dome event (see section).

Warren/AP. 2022 King Tide Flood Event nd th In late December 2022 – between December 22 through December 28 – the city experienced multiple consecutive events that led to compounding �looding impacts across the city. Seattle experienced a historic winter storm that included snowfall and freezing rain nd rd on December 22 and December 23 (Bleed & Hollingsworth, 2022). Several days later, on th December 27 , the city also experienced a king tide – a colloquial term that references exceptionally high tides – combined with storm surge during a low-pressure storm to create a �lood event across shoreline areas in Seattle that was the highest recorded �lood in over 30 years (Sundell, 2022). Finally, the city and the Paci�ic Northwest experienced a th series of heavy rains driven by atmospheric rivers between December 27 and December st 31 (Bekiempis, 2022).

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Figure 49. Multiple Consecutive Events in December 2022 Led to Severe King Tide Flooding and Limited Response Capacity Independent from each other, each of these events would have resulted in mild to severe �looding – rain-on-snow snowmelt, atmospheric rivers, and King Tides can all cause �looding. However, in sequence, these events lead to compounding and amplifying �looding impacts as systems may not have conveyed all water before the next event and response capacity may be limited due to safety concerns of �irst responders (Figure 49). Additionally, the December 2022 King Tide event was an exceptionally high King Tide that led to unprecedented �looding – with �looding approximately 13 feet (NAVD88) – for neighborhoods like South Park, which was further worsened by the winter storm immediately before and the atmospheric rivers immediately after the King Tide event. While it is dif�icult to attribute a speci�ic King Tide event to climate change, King Tides provide a glimpse into what future sea levels will look like. The 2022 King Tide event is similar to projected sea levels in the 2080s under RCP8.5. Water overtopped the riverbanks �irst at the lowest points along the bank in South Park, th including the intersections of 5 Ave. S and S Fontanelle St. and S Riverside St. and S Austin St. As the water rose higher, higher elevation areas of the bank began to over�low, including th th the intersection of S Riverside Dr. and S 7 Ave. and the intersection of S 8 Ave. and S Portland St. In addition to �looding coming over the riverbanks, 13 households were displaced, and families and businesses in South Park experienced sewer over�lows inside homes and buildings as the high river water pushed backward into combined sewer and stormwater pipes. Street �looding from stormwater was also observed in low-lying areas in Georgetown affecting multiple industrial properties. Cascading and Compounding Climate Impacts | 100",
        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Conclusion Climate Resilience Opportunities This CVA outlines the city of Seattle’s physical and social vulnerabilities to the most critical known climate hazards. The areas of vulnerability discussed in this assessment overlap and intersect with social injustices – including income inequality, disparities in health outcomes and access to amenities and services, and access to safe, adequate housing. The City is committed to responding to the multitude of challenges presented by climate change and supporting a more equitable and resilient future for all residents. This CVA has assessed climate change impacts and social and physical vulnerability across Seattle. It has identi�ied that �looding and sea level rise, extreme heat, wild�ire smoke, and extreme precipitation will have wide-ranging and interconnected impacts for the city. There • Invest in community services are some key, broad areas that the City can invest in to address these: , including cooling and clean air centers, access to cooling and air �iltration systems for homes, and tree canopy.

        "Seattle Climate Vulnerability Assessment Appendix A. Detailed Methodology and Results This section will describe the methodology and detailed results of the index approach Cascadia used to determine relative social vulnerability of census tracts. The Social and Economic Vulnerability Assessment utilizes an index approach, which is a method to qFuauntlilta tLiveilys ntor moafliz eI mnudltipilce caritteroia rthsat aClloowsn fors coimdpeararbeilidty. We developed a potential list of sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators by referencing comparable vulnerability assessments, such as those from the City of Redmond (WA) and Los Angeles County (CA), as well as a technical guidance document from the University of Notre Dame (BERK Consulting, Inc.; Perteet; The Watershed Company; UW Climate Impacts Group, 2022; LA County, 2021; Chen, et al., 2015). After developing the initial list, we solicited additional potential indicators and data sources from City staff and through additional data requests. • Is the data relevant? We then vetted all potential indicators by asking the following questions: • Is the data available?W e used indicators that are as recent as possible and that have clear connections to climate change. • Is the data high qualitDya? tasets need to be publicly available or shareable without sensitive and identi�iable dat a being shared. • Is the data at a census traWcet- laevvoeidl erdes doaltuatsieotns ?t hat are incomplete and sought local datasets whenever possible. • Does the data show variability across the cityW? e included all census tracts that are within city boundaries and that overlap with city boundaries. Some datasets are relevant, high quality, and available at the census tract level, but do not show any variability across the city and are therefore not useful for the indices. The full list of indicators can be found below. The �irst table lists indicators that apply across the focus areas; subsequent tables show indicators by focus area. Appendix A.

We consolidated comments from the Jamboard activity and discussion to provide an overview of additional considerations for Cascadia to incorporate in the methodology. 1. For each sector, we had three primary questions: 2. Do the methodology and results resonate? 3. What might we be missing from our methodology? What other caveats and considerations should we keep in mind? Key discussion themes for each sector are in the table below. Appendix C. Community Partner Meeting Summary | 133",

Reflections and Next Steps The consultant team will follow up with participants for data sources and follow up on comments as needed. In addition, the p roject team will do the following next steps:  Develop Physical Climate Vulnerability Assessment methodology,  Assess compounding and cascading impacts, and Begin synthesis and documentation of vulnerability assessment.
