VISION STORY: city in the world to flooding due to sea-level rise.12 While the cost of increasing coastal resilience is high—as much as $3 billion—it’s less than the cost of cleaning BOSTON HARBOR CLEAN-UP Boston Harbor. The task of protecting our city from sea-level rise and storm surges is even more In the early 1980s, Boston Harbor was considered the most degraded harbor in complex than the harbor clean-up.

The MWRA created an in-house team, the Program Management Division (PMD) to manage the project, including two consulting teams. This internal organization protected the resources of the rest of the agency from being tapped by the harbor projects and ensured that staff time was not divided among different projects.

WHAT WE’RE FACING In this context, it matters that Mayor Wu is prioritizing East Boston—she has signaled that equity is at the forefront of decision-making. Mariama White- Hammond, Chief of Energy, Environment, and Open Space, reinforced that priority: “We can’t say ‘equity’ and prioritize downtown over East Boston.”18 The 2022 Sixth Assessment Report on Vulnerability and Adaptation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that climate-driven The dilemma is that East Boston and downtown are part of one coastline. We growth in storm surge and rainfall intensity, along with more rapidly melting Arctic cannot focus on protecting one neighborhood or individual parcels—a regional and Antarctic ice sheets and ocean thermal expansion, will increase the likelihood solution that centralizes equity is the only answer.

But they can also provide strong resilience measures, increase public access to the waterfront, and benefit inland property Extreme precipitation events have become more frequent and intense in recent owners and residents. We see evidence in the strategies employed by Related Beal decades, and this change is expected to continue. The most recent projections and other developers along the Fort Point Channel. point to a 10–20 percent increase in daily precipitation intensity by 2050 and 20–30 percent increase by 2100. In addition to flooding, increased heavy rainfall At some point, coastal resilience must be integrated with stormwater management will stress stormwater infrastructure. and urban heat island abatement. Our focus in this first Climate Progress Report for Boston is on the most urgent matter at hand—figuring out the governance, funding, Boston increasingly experiences sunny-day flooding from high tides. The city had and regulatory changes needed for coastal resilience. 22 days of such flooding in 2017, and by 2030, is projected to have up to 35 days and up to 95 days annually by 2050.16 The 2022 GBRAG report estimates that high- tide flooding will occur in about half of the days of a given year. Most of the Boston area’s extreme flooding events are caused by winter storms that coincide with astronomical high tides. Under all emissions scenarios, what is now a one in 10- year winter storm flood will likely become an annual event by mid-century. While Boston has billions of dollars of infrastructure and buildings to protect, resilience must prioritize people—and particularly the most vulnerable, based on likely exposure to coastal flooding and their ability to withstand and recover from extreme weather. The need for equitable resilience was raised in the IPCC’s 2022 Sixth Assessment Report on Vulnerability and Adaptation: “The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritizing investment to reduce climate risk for low-income and marginalized residents.”17 With this understanding, Boston’s coastal resilience planning must both prepare for harsher flooding events and commit fully to prioritizing our most vulnerable communities in the adaptation process beyond a narrow focus on open-space access. 8 Supplementary Chapter 3: Building a Resilient Coastline for Boston BOSTON CLIMATE PROGRESS REPORT 2022 993.

It is a frequent complaint that the BPDA needs to extract more from developers. A recent illustration that developers would be more responsive to City demands is a challenge to Cronin Holdings on its luxury condo complex at 150 Seaport Boulevard brought by the Conservation Law Foundation. Jon Cronin agreed to a settlement that would require 60 percent of the project’s land be maintained for public use, including a large dock. He also agreed to pay $13 million into a fund over 35 years to build a new waterfront park in South Boston as a resilience measure.23 The City went beyond guidance when City Council passed the Boston coastal flood resilience zoning overlay district (Article 25A) in October 2021 to protect the areas of Boston projected to be at risk of a 1 percent chance storm event in 2070 with 40 inches of sea-level rise. The overlay builds upon and formalizes the Coastal Flood Resilience Design Guidelines and establishes sea-level rise flood elevations for new construction and retrofits. It promotes designs that prevent flood damage by elevating a building’s occupiable space and flood proofing areas beneath flood elevations in both new and retrofit projects.24 The new standards also set requirements for a project’s height and setbacks and include new open space requirements. While the regulations will mostly apply to larger projects, some smaller projects (10,000 square feet and under) will undergo the review in parts of the city closest to the harbor. The Zoning Overlay District extends beyond the FEMA-designated flood plain and covers more than 5,000 acres of land at risk from coastal flooding, including the Seaport, Chinatown, South End, and East Boston neighborhoods, as well as parts of South Boston, the North End, Dorchester, Charlestown, and the Downtown area.25 The overlay district covers what will be 85,000 people and $85 billion in buildings by 207026 (Figure 1). While the guidelines are rigorous, the new rules may not fully address serious urban design problems. One expert told the Boston Globe that the new overlay district’s height requirements for a new building’s first floor will mean that it will be much higher than its neighbors and the current street, leading to an unappealing street-level view.27 Some also question whether the requirements sufficiently consider potential flooding like that seen from hurricanes Sandy or Ida. The Zoning Overlay District is a significant step toward more resilient construction. The City can adapt the code to address these concerns, but because much of this area is already built and not undergoing major retrofits, many property owners won’t be required to become flood resilient. 12 Supplementary Chapter 3: Building a Resilient Coastline for Boston BOSTON CLIMATE PROGRESS REPORT 2022 1133reviewing projects to ensure that they use best practices for flood resistant design.

In 2020, the Boston Globe reported that the Trustees has sourced $20 million from private donors.34 An additional $2 million was proposed in a 2022 state legislature economic development bill that did not pass. The New England Aquarium unveiled a master plan for a Blueway in 2016. It proposes an active, educational public environment extending from the Greenway to the waterfront. The concept incorporates resilience measures on the Aquarium property that could connect to measures implemented on adjacent properties.35 This proposal was supported and promoted through the 2018 Downtown Boston Municipal Harbor Plan, which allocated funds for its continued development. In addition, local universities are testing and piloting nature-based solutions. The Stone Lab at UMass Boston tests and scales nature-based approaches to climate adaptation, coastal resilience, and ecological restoration in Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park.

Stone Foundation, which provided UMass Boston with a $5 million grant to fund the research. Northeastern University and independent coastal engineering researchers are piloting an “Emerald Tutu,” which seeks to create a network of floating modular biomass marsh mats and walkways to reduce coastal flooding by dampening incoming wave energy (Figure 4). The project’s name plays off Boston’s iconic interlinked Emerald Necklace of parks. Critics suggest that the Emerald Tutu would not be compatible with large ships that bring liquid natural gas, salt, and autos to the harbor (all other traffic goes to the port terminal outside of the inner harbor) and other water uses. According to Gabriel Cira, the project lead, because the mat network is flexible and adaptable, it could easily be configured to accommodate major shipping lanes and other recreational uses such as swimming, boating, and fishing. A feasibility analysis would have to establish whether shipping and recreational uses are compatible and how much protection it could deliver at scale. Another concern is that even at the depicted scale, it would not have enough impact to slow storm surges. Other professionals we talked to raised questions about the impact the Emerald Tutu would have on the marine ecosystem below the project.

BOSTON’S STRATEGIES AND Figure 5: Reinforced Dune Components CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING Source: Guardian Retention Systems RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE Boston needs three types of flood protection: flood-resilient buildings; constructed barriers; and nature-based solutions. Except for individual buildings, these solutions need to be regional in scale as flooding does not recognize property or jurisdictional boundaries.36 Many parts of Boston will require a multi-layered approach.37 There are three key challenges to implementation. First, the City has limited jurisdiction to act since much of Boston’s 47-mile coastline is privately owned and heavily developed. Second, coastal resilience projects must obtain permitting from multiple agencies with sometimes contradictory goals. A third challenge is the lack of a consistent and sufficient funding stream to pay for costly resilience infrastructure. Even when projects are approved for federal funding, it can take years for the money to flow to the city. The first type of flood protection, flood-resilient buildings, was discussed earlier. We turn to explaining the second and third types of flood protection, then to a discussion of these challenges and possible solutions to them. Constructed Barriers U.S. cities have been employing constructed barriers or gray infrastructure such as levees, seawalls, or gates to protect themselves from the seas for at least 200 years. Designed under Boston’s Climate Resilient Design Standards and Guidelines, the Hard-engineered coastal infrastructure is typically installed to protect built-up areas North End’s Langone Park and Puopolo Playground is a more integrated hybrid from severe flooding and other extreme weather events. Although some constructed approach.

BOSTON’S STRATEGIES AND Figure 5: Reinforced Dune Components CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING Source: Guardian Retention Systems RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE Boston needs three types of flood protection: flood-resilient buildings; constructed barriers; and nature-based solutions. Except for individual buildings, these solutions need to be regional in scale as flooding does not recognize property or jurisdictional boundaries.36 Many parts of Boston will require a multi-layered approach.37 There are three key challenges to implementation. First, the City has limited jurisdiction to act since much of Boston’s 47-mile coastline is privately owned and heavily developed. Second, coastal resilience projects must obtain permitting from multiple agencies with sometimes contradictory goals. A third challenge is the lack of a consistent and sufficient funding stream to pay for costly resilience infrastructure. Even when projects are approved for federal funding, it can take years for the money to flow to the city. The first type of flood protection, flood-resilient buildings, was discussed earlier. We turn to explaining the second and third types of flood protection, then to a discussion of these challenges and possible solutions to them. Constructed Barriers U.S. cities have been employing constructed barriers or gray infrastructure such as levees, seawalls, or gates to protect themselves from the seas for at least 200 years. Designed under Boston’s Climate Resilient Design Standards and Guidelines, the Hard-engineered coastal infrastructure is typically installed to protect built-up areas North End’s Langone Park and Puopolo Playground is a more integrated hybrid from severe flooding and other extreme weather events. Although some constructed approach.

Inspired by, supported by, or copied from nature, NBS are living solutions that provide economic, societal, and ecological benefits. NBS safeguards public health by fostering clean air and water, increasing natural resilience, and sequestering carbon.46 Coastal NBS include living shorelines like marshes, oyster beds, etc., that provide habitat while elevating the coastline above projected flood levels. Examples of nature-based solutions protecting from stormwater include floodable parks, rain gardens, and constructed wetlands. Parks with nature-based features allow stormwater to flow in and out without causing permanent damage and add to a neighborhood’s social fabric. There is a climate justice element to nature-based solutions to the extent that they add much-needed green space to low-income neighborhoods and can reduce the urban heat island effect. But for residents to embrace NBS, they must be involved in the planning and design process.47 Langone Park & Puopolo Playground is a major success. The City is planning a much more ambitious project on the border of South Boston and Dorchester. Joe Moakley Park, just inland from Carson Beach, is designed to provide both coastal flood resilience and much improved recreational amenities by combining land-use planning and nature-based solutions. A dune would act as the first line of defense, while flooding would be managed through a series of rising landforms and terraces (Figure 7). Playing fields will be able to absorb rainwater while also keeping the park a functional public space. The redesign of the space has been an ongoing priority and project for the city since 2018, but the lack of funding has slowed implementation. Revitalizing the 60-acre park has an estimated cost of $240 million; as of fall 2022, it had only secured 1 percent of that total in federal and local funding. Completing fundraising for this project could take years, highlighting the challenge of raising public funds for resilience. Funding challenges are significant, but unfortunately not the only barrier to implementing the solutions we've outlined.

The nine-acre DPU at Jeffries Point was deemed eligible for review.52 In response, in September 2022 Mayor Wu made the case for removing the DPAs along East Boston’s Inner Harbor and Chelsea Creek because the future of the neighborhood is not industrial. She proposed instituting “community resilience zoning” in these areas to prevent speculative real estate investment. Instead, the zoning designation would require developers to contribute funds for affordable housing and create open space. While the BPDA argues that the DPAs make it impossible for the City to incorporate coastal resilience into development, the real problem is that the City is forced to fund resilience by leveraging private development, which cannot be done if market- based development is not allowed in the DPAs. It isn’t clear that “community resilience zoning” would be enough to prevent further gentrification and displacement of East Boston residents. Opening DPAs for market-rate development to stimulate privately funded climate resilience projects is a decision that cannot be taken lightly given that the reason the DPAs are protected is that they are a finite resource—deep water access on the harbor. The DPAs serve to depress real estate values on that section of the water to allow maritime industrial businesses that would otherwise be unable to compete against market-value real estate development. Although water-dependent industrial uses have declined during the past 20 or 30 years, there may be a new need for deep water access for the offshore wind industry or other uses. Wu’s vision conflicts with the stated needs of the Commonwealth for protecting industrial uses. There is community opposition to having the DPA designation removed. East Boston residents are concerned that de-designating the port areas will pave the way for expensive new housing developments that will add to the ongoing gentrification and displacement the neighborhood is experiencing.53 Although an industrial use on the East Boston waterfront may not be ideal, many residents see it as the only thing preventing them from being priced out of their neighborhood. The bottom line is that Massachusetts has many active DPAs with profitable and vital port operations and maritime industrial users (e.g., Ray Flynn Marine Park in South Boston). Salem’s port is innovating in offshore wind uses. To address these competing interests, we need an assessment of how state government could use DPAs for innovative blue tech and clean energy uses and how to link these uses to climate resilience. The economic development opportunities could be large for offshore wind in particular. The equity implications here are that the DPAs are the first line of defense for the neighborhoods behind them and the potential to provide jobs that don’t require college degrees.

GOVERNANCE OPTIONS FOR municipalities have used the MHP process to take “excessive liberties.”63 The COASTAL PROTECTION Conservation Law Foundation filed a lawsuit with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court arguing that the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who is politically appointed, did not have the legal authority to approve the City’s initial waterfront development plan. The court ruled in CLF’s favor in July 2022, There is widespread agreement that coastal resilience needs to be more effectively concluding that this authority was exclusive to DEP professional staff. DEP will managed. There are too many cooks in the kitchen, so to speak. There are agencies issue a regulatory response to amend the program in accordance with the Court’s working at cross purposes. There are jurisdictional limits that constrain action. decision. Cities and towns can block each other’s projects. There is little coordination among the many agencies and organizations involved. Conflict can also arise among cities and towns.

Some also add the power of eminent domain to the list since many storm-surge and sea-level rise barriers will need to be built on private property. We explore these options below. Implementation Barrier: Inadequate Funding Massachusetts Water Resources Authority Several reports examining Boston’s capacity to protect its coastline from sea-level rise and storm surge note that considerably more funding will be needed. For The mission of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) is to provide example, Boston’s May 2022 application for state funding for the Ryan Playground reliable, cost-effective, high-quality water and sewer services. Like the BWSC, the resilience project in Charlestown states, “As of Spring 2022, the City has identified MWRA has been investing in making its infrastructure more resilient. While many 70 priority projects needed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of residents in people point to MWRA’s success in the Boston Harbor clean-up and suggest it Boston. The cost to implement the projects is estimated at about $3 billion.” This is would be the ideal agency to coordinate and deliver on coastal resilience, there considerably more than the estimates from the neighborhood plans. are reasons to suggest not. First, since much of the clean-up involved building the Deer Island facility and related piping, the task was closely aligned with MWRA’s Federal funding from the 2022 Inflation Recovery Act will help, but a consistent narrowly defined mission. Adding coastal resilience would require protecting state source of state funding is needed. The main funding mechanism for NBS projects assets affected by sea-level rise and storm surges such as roads and highways, at the state level is the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness program, which was a transit system, and the Amtrak system—which would take the agency far afield created by Governor Baker via an executive order in 2017. The annual budget for from its current mission. Second, MWRA created a separate division to manage this program for cities and towns to plan and implement climate resilience projects the clean-up, which it disbanded once the task was completed.

GOVERNANCE OPTIONS FOR municipalities have used the MHP process to take “excessive liberties.”63 The COASTAL PROTECTION Conservation Law Foundation filed a lawsuit with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court arguing that the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who is politically appointed, did not have the legal authority to approve the City’s initial waterfront development plan. The court ruled in CLF’s favor in July 2022, There is widespread agreement that coastal resilience needs to be more effectively concluding that this authority was exclusive to DEP professional staff. DEP will managed. There are too many cooks in the kitchen, so to speak. There are agencies issue a regulatory response to amend the program in accordance with the Court’s working at cross purposes. There are jurisdictional limits that constrain action. decision. Cities and towns can block each other’s projects. There is little coordination among the many agencies and organizations involved. Conflict can also arise among cities and towns. Under the Wetland Protection Act, many municipalities are permitted to have their own local wetland bylaws and There is not widespread agreement, however, on a particular governance solution. additions to the state law. This power can sometimes create conflict. A high-profile Some argue that we need a new statewide agency to orchestrate integrated example is the Quincy Conservation Commission denying Boston permission to solutions and manage resilience for the entire Massachusetts coastline. Others rebuild the Long Island bridge from Long Island to Quincy because it violated suggest that a coordinating function could be undertaken by an existing its wetland protection laws. In July 2022 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial organization. But which existing organization? Opinions vary. Some argue for a Court ruled against Quincy on the grounds that a more stringent local bylaw regional authority such as the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). must specifically establish how it surpasses the DEP’s regulation of the activity Others look to the example of Maryland and its Regional Authorities. in question and explain how the stricter bylaw applies to the activity in question. Going back to our harbor clean-up vision story, the guiding agency would need Although the court ruled that Quincy’s bylaw did not do that, it preserved the right considerable power to finance improvements; assess costs; conduct engineering of municipalities to establish independent bylaws providing the two criteria are studies; manage engineering, design, and construction; administer contract; and met.64 have information systems and environmental planning expertise. Some also add the power of eminent domain to the list since many storm-surge and sea-level rise barriers will need to be built on private property. We explore these options below. Implementation Barrier: Inadequate Funding Massachusetts Water Resources Authority Several reports examining Boston’s capacity to protect its coastline from sea-level rise and storm surge note that considerably more funding will be needed. For The mission of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) is to provide example, Boston’s May 2022 application for state funding for the Ryan Playground reliable, cost-effective, high-quality water and sewer services. Like the BWSC, the resilience project in Charlestown states, “As of Spring 2022, the City has identified MWRA has been investing in making its infrastructure more resilient. While many 70 priority projects needed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of residents in people point to MWRA’s success in the Boston Harbor clean-up and suggest it Boston. The cost to implement the projects is estimated at about $3 billion.” This is would be the ideal agency to coordinate and deliver on coastal resilience, there considerably more than the estimates from the neighborhood plans. are reasons to suggest not. First, since much of the clean-up involved building the Deer Island facility and related piping, the task was closely aligned with MWRA’s Federal funding from the 2022 Inflation Recovery Act will help, but a consistent narrowly defined mission. Adding coastal resilience would require protecting state source of state funding is needed. The main funding mechanism for NBS projects assets affected by sea-level rise and storm surges such as roads and highways, at the state level is the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness program, which was a transit system, and the Amtrak system—which would take the agency far afield created by Governor Baker via an executive order in 2017. The annual budget for from its current mission. Second, MWRA created a separate division to manage this program for cities and towns to plan and implement climate resilience projects the clean-up, which it disbanded once the task was completed. Coastal resilience is about $20 million. Most grants are less than $30,000, meaning they cover only management is an ongoing task that would require permanent staff. Stephen Estes- initial planning.

The legislature needs to pass it in the next session. of 10 companies, will build the garage and invest up to $25 million to transform City Dock into an elevated park (Figure 9).82 Other resilience measures include Our window to act effectively is closing. The cost of action will only increase. We heightened sea walls, hydraulic and flip-up flood gates, and a pump station.83 will need all hands on deck to protect Boston’s coastline: city, state, and federal government; nonprofit organizations; frontline communities and the organizations Annapolis Mobility & Resilience Partners will design, build, and finance the garage that represent them; and the private sector. There is no time to lose. and recoup their costs with revenues from the garage. The deal allows the city to maintain ownership of the garage, but Annapolis Mobility & Resilience partners will receive its revenue for 30 years and will also maintain and operate it. Once the group starts collecting parking revenue, it will use it to finance the City Dock project. The City will retain about $1 million annually from garage revenue, which will be invested in public transportation. Annapolis must raise between $10 and $15 million of the $35 million cost of the park, for which it is seeking state and federal support. As many experts have pointed out, a critical component of successful resilience planning is shifting from one-time grants to dedicated funding streams. Federal dollars, through ARPA and the IRA bill, will provide dedicated funding streams. State funding streams are also opening, but in the end, an agency with bonding authority will be needed to support statewide coastal resilience. 40 Supplementary Chapter 3: Building a Resilient Coastline for Boston BOSTON CLIMATE PROGRESS REPORT 2022 44119.

Our focus in this first Climate Progress Report for Boston is on the most urgent matter at hand—figuring out the governance, funding, Boston increasingly experiences sunny-day flooding from high tides. The city had and regulatory changes needed for coastal resilience. 22 days of such flooding in 2017, and by 2030, is projected to have up to 35 days and up to 95 days annually by 2050.16 The 2022 GBRAG report estimates that high- tide flooding will occur in about half of the days of a given year. Most of the Boston area’s extreme flooding events are caused by winter storms that coincide with astronomical high tides. Under all emissions scenarios, what is now a one in 10- year winter storm flood will likely become an annual event by mid-century. While Boston has billions of dollars of infrastructure and buildings to protect, resilience must prioritize people—and particularly the most vulnerable, based on likely exposure to coastal flooding and their ability to withstand and recover from extreme weather. The need for equitable resilience was raised in the IPCC’s 2022 Sixth Assessment Report on Vulnerability and Adaptation: “The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritizing investment to reduce climate risk for low-income and marginalized residents.”17 With this understanding, Boston’s coastal resilience planning must both prepare for harsher flooding events and commit fully to prioritizing our most vulnerable communities in the adaptation process beyond a narrow focus on open-space access. 8 Supplementary Chapter 3: Building a Resilient Coastline for Boston BOSTON CLIMATE PROGRESS REPORT 2022 99",

Jon Cronin agreed to a settlement that would require 60 percent of the project’s land be maintained for public use, including a large dock. He also agreed to pay $13 million into a fund over 35 years to build a new waterfront park in South Boston as a resilience measure.23 The City went beyond guidance when City Council passed the Boston coastal flood resilience zoning overlay district (Article 25A) in October 2021 to protect the areas of Boston projected to be at risk of a 1 percent chance storm event in 2070 with 40 inches of sea-level rise. The overlay builds upon and formalizes the Coastal Flood Resilience Design Guidelines and establishes sea-level rise flood elevations for new construction and retrofits. It promotes designs that prevent flood damage by elevating a building’s occupiable space and flood proofing areas beneath flood elevations in both new and retrofit projects.24 The new standards also set requirements for a project’s height and setbacks and include new open space requirements. While the regulations will mostly apply to larger projects, some smaller projects (10,000 square feet and under) will undergo the review in parts of the city closest to the harbor. The Zoning Overlay District extends beyond the FEMA-designated flood plain and covers more than 5,000 acres of land at risk from coastal flooding, including the Seaport, Chinatown, South End, and East Boston neighborhoods, as well as parts of South Boston, the North End, Dorchester, Charlestown, and the Downtown area.25 The overlay district covers what will be 85,000 people and $85 billion in buildings by 207026 (Figure 1). While the guidelines are rigorous, the new rules may not fully address serious urban design problems. One expert told the Boston Globe that the new overlay district’s height requirements for a new building’s first floor will mean that it will be much higher than its neighbors and the current street, leading to an unappealing street-level view.27 Some also question whether the requirements sufficiently consider potential flooding like that seen from hurricanes Sandy or Ida. The Zoning Overlay District is a significant step toward more resilient construction. The City can adapt the code to address these concerns, but because much of this area is already built and not undergoing major retrofits, many property owners won’t be required to become flood resilient. 12 Supplementary Chapter 3: Building a Resilient Coastline for Boston BOSTON CLIMATE PROGRESS REPORT 2022 1133",

According to Gabriel Cira, the project lead, because the mat network is flexible and adaptable, it could easily be configured to accommodate major shipping lanes and other recreational uses such as swimming, boating, and fishing.

        "5. BOSTON’S STRATEGIES AND Figure 5: Reinforced Dune Components CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING Source: Guardian Retention Systems RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE Boston needs three types of flood protection: flood-resilient buildings; constructed barriers; and nature-based solutions. Except for individual buildings, these solutions need to be regional in scale as flooding does not recognize property or jurisdictional boundaries.36 Many parts of Boston will require a multi-layered approach.37 There are three key challenges to implementation. First, the City has limited jurisdiction to act since much of Boston’s 47-mile coastline is privately owned and heavily developed. Second, coastal resilience projects must obtain permitting from multiple agencies with sometimes contradictory goals. A third challenge is the lack of a consistent and sufficient funding stream to pay for costly resilience infrastructure. Even when projects are approved for federal funding, it can take years for the money to flow to the city. The first type of flood protection, flood-resilient buildings, was discussed earlier. We turn to explaining the second and third types of flood protection, then to a discussion of these challenges and possible solutions to them. Constructed Barriers U.S. cities have been employing constructed barriers or gray infrastructure such as levees, seawalls, or gates to protect themselves from the seas for at least 200 years.

        "5. BOSTON’S STRATEGIES AND Figure 5: Reinforced Dune Components CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING Source: Guardian Retention Systems RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE Boston needs three types of flood protection: flood-resilient buildings; constructed barriers; and nature-based solutions. Except for individual buildings, these solutions need to be regional in scale as flooding does not recognize property or jurisdictional boundaries.36 Many parts of Boston will require a multi-layered approach.37 There are three key challenges to implementation. First, the City has limited jurisdiction to act since much of Boston’s 47-mile coastline is privately owned and heavily developed. Second, coastal resilience projects must obtain permitting from multiple agencies with sometimes contradictory goals. A third challenge is the lack of a consistent and sufficient funding stream to pay for costly resilience infrastructure. Even when projects are approved for federal funding, it can take years for the money to flow to the city. The first type of flood protection, flood-resilient buildings, was discussed earlier. We turn to explaining the second and third types of flood protection, then to a discussion of these challenges and possible solutions to them. Constructed Barriers U.S. cities have been employing constructed barriers or gray infrastructure such as levees, seawalls, or gates to protect themselves from the seas for at least 200 years. Designed under Boston’s Climate Resilient Design Standards and Guidelines, the Hard-engineered coastal infrastructure is typically installed to protect built-up areas North End’s Langone Park and Puopolo Playground is a more integrated hybrid from severe flooding and other extreme weather events.

Inspired by, supported by, or copied from nature, NBS are living solutions that provide economic, societal, and ecological benefits. NBS safeguards public health by fostering clean air and water, increasing natural resilience, and sequestering carbon.46 Coastal NBS include living shorelines like marshes, oyster beds, etc., that provide habitat while elevating the coastline above projected flood levels. Examples of nature-based solutions protecting from stormwater include floodable parks, rain gardens, and constructed wetlands. Parks with nature-based features allow stormwater to flow in and out without causing permanent damage and add to a neighborhood’s social fabric. There is a climate justice element to nature-based solutions to the extent that they add much-needed green space to low-income neighborhoods and can reduce the urban heat island effect. But for residents to embrace NBS, they must be involved in the planning and design process.47 Langone Park & Puopolo Playground is a major success. The City is planning a much more ambitious project on the border of South Boston and Dorchester. Joe Moakley Park, just inland from Carson Beach, is designed to provide both coastal flood resilience and much improved recreational amenities by combining land-use planning and nature-based solutions. A dune would act as the first line of defense, while flooding would be managed through a series of rising landforms and terraces (Figure 7). Playing fields will be able to absorb rainwater while also keeping the park a functional public space. The redesign of the space has been an ongoing priority and project for the city since 2018, but the lack of funding has slowed implementation. Revitalizing the 60-acre park has an estimated cost of $240 million; as of fall 2022, it had only secured 1 percent of that total in federal and local funding. Completing fundraising for this project could take years, highlighting the challenge of raising public funds for resilience. Funding challenges are significant, but unfortunately not the only barrier to implementing the solutions we've outlined.

The nine-acre DPU at Jeffries Point was deemed eligible for review.52 In response, in September 2022 Mayor Wu made the case for removing the DPAs along East Boston’s Inner Harbor and Chelsea Creek because the future of the neighborhood is not industrial. She proposed instituting “community resilience zoning” in these areas to prevent speculative real estate investment. Instead, the zoning designation would require developers to contribute funds for affordable housing and create open space. While the BPDA argues that the DPAs make it impossible for the City to incorporate coastal resilience into development, the real problem is that the City is forced to fund resilience by leveraging private development, which cannot be done if market- based development is not allowed in the DPAs. It isn’t clear that “community resilience zoning” would be enough to prevent further gentrification and displacement of East Boston residents. Opening DPAs for market-rate development to stimulate privately funded climate resilience projects is a decision that cannot be taken lightly given that the reason the DPAs are protected is that they are a finite resource—deep water access on the harbor. The DPAs serve to depress real estate values on that section of the water to allow maritime industrial businesses that would otherwise be unable to compete against market-value real estate development. Although water-dependent industrial uses have declined during the past 20 or 30 years, there may be a new need for deep water access for the offshore wind industry or other uses. Wu’s vision conflicts with the stated needs of the Commonwealth for protecting industrial uses. There is community opposition to having the DPA designation removed. East Boston residents are concerned that de-designating the port areas will pave the way for expensive new housing developments that will add to the ongoing gentrification and displacement the neighborhood is experiencing.53 Although an industrial use on the East Boston waterfront may not be ideal, many residents see it as the only thing preventing them from being priced out of their neighborhood. The bottom line is that Massachusetts has many active DPAs with profitable and vital port operations and maritime industrial users (e.g., Ray Flynn Marine Park in South Boston).

To address these competing interests, we need an assessment of how state government could use DPAs for innovative blue tech and clean energy uses and how to link these uses to climate resilience.

GOVERNANCE OPTIONS FOR municipalities have used the MHP process to take “excessive liberties.”63 The COASTAL PROTECTION Conservation Law Foundation filed a lawsuit with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court arguing that the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who is politically appointed, did not have the legal authority to approve the City’s initial waterfront development plan.

Some also add the power of eminent domain to the list since many storm-surge and sea-level rise barriers will need to be built on private property. We explore these options below. Implementation Barrier: Inadequate Funding Massachusetts Water Resources Authority Several reports examining Boston’s capacity to protect its coastline from sea-level rise and storm surge note that considerably more funding will be needed. For The mission of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) is to provide example, Boston’s May 2022 application for state funding for the Ryan Playground reliable, cost-effective, high-quality water and sewer services. Like the BWSC, the resilience project in Charlestown states, “As of Spring 2022, the City has identified MWRA has been investing in making its infrastructure more resilient. While many 70 priority projects needed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of residents in people point to MWRA’s success in the Boston Harbor clean-up and suggest it Boston. The cost to implement the projects is estimated at about $3 billion.” This is would be the ideal agency to coordinate and deliver on coastal resilience, there considerably more than the estimates from the neighborhood plans. are reasons to suggest not.

GOVERNANCE OPTIONS FOR municipalities have used the MHP process to take “excessive liberties.”63 The COASTAL PROTECTION Conservation Law Foundation filed a lawsuit with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court arguing that the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who is politically appointed, did not have the legal authority to approve the City’s initial waterfront development plan. The court ruled in CLF’s favor in July 2022, There is widespread agreement that coastal resilience needs to be more effectively concluding that this authority was exclusive to DEP professional staff. DEP will managed. There are too many cooks in the kitchen, so to speak. There are agencies issue a regulatory response to amend the program in accordance with the Court’s working at cross purposes. There are jurisdictional limits that constrain action. decision. Cities and towns can block each other’s projects. There is little coordination among the many agencies and organizations involved. Conflict can also arise among cities and towns. Under the Wetland Protection Act, many municipalities are permitted to have their own local wetland bylaws and There is not widespread agreement, however, on a particular governance solution. additions to the state law. This power can sometimes create conflict. A high-profile Some argue that we need a new statewide agency to orchestrate integrated example is the Quincy Conservation Commission denying Boston permission to solutions and manage resilience for the entire Massachusetts coastline. Others rebuild the Long Island bridge from Long Island to Quincy because it violated suggest that a coordinating function could be undertaken by an existing its wetland protection laws. In July 2022 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial organization. But which existing organization? Opinions vary.

While many 70 priority projects needed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of residents in people point to MWRA’s success in the Boston Harbor clean-up and suggest it Boston.

Ongoing efforts to align regulations with 40-year-old Noah Hillman parking garage in Annapolis was crumbling to the point coastal resilience need to be accelerated so projects can advance. of being unsafe, but the city did not want to assume debt or bonds in the amount of $28 million to tear it down and replace it. At the same time, the land adjacent to We presented two alternatives for governing coastline resilience—a new state the garage—the city’s historic district and City Dock were particularly vulnerable agency or a new regional authority. The mayor and her new planning team need to storm surges. City Dock alone flooded 65 times in 2019, which is predicted to to work with the governor to figure out the best approach for Boston and the increase to 200 by 2030 and 350 by 2040.80 Commonwealth. So, what are the options if a city does not have the funds to address either Finally, we will need considerably more money to finance this enormous problem?81 Annapolis issued a request for proposals for a project that would both undertaking. While new federal funding will be welcome, the state also needs build a new parking garage and a park that provides resilience to sea-level rise. an ongoing source of capital. The HERO Act is a viable new tax with bi-partisan The winning proposal from Annapolis Mobility & Resilience Partners, a consortium support. The legislature needs to pass it in the next session. of 10 companies, will build the garage and invest up to $25 million to transform City Dock into an elevated park (Figure 9).82 Other resilience measures include Our window to act effectively is closing. The cost of action will only increase. We heightened sea walls, hydraulic and flip-up flood gates, and a pump station.83 will need all hands on deck to protect Boston’s coastline: city, state, and federal government; nonprofit organizations; frontline communities and the organizations Annapolis Mobility & Resilience Partners will design, build, and finance the garage that represent them; and the private sector. There is no time to lose. and recoup their costs with revenues from the garage. The deal allows the city to maintain ownership of the garage, but Annapolis Mobility & Resilience partners will receive its revenue for 30 years and will also maintain and operate it. Once the group starts collecting parking revenue, it will use it to finance the City Dock project. The City will retain about $1 million annually from garage revenue, which will be invested in public transportation. Annapolis must raise between $10 and $15 million of the $35 million cost of the park, for which it is seeking state and federal support. As many experts have pointed out, a critical component of successful resilience planning is shifting from one-time grants to dedicated funding streams. Federal dollars, through ARPA and the IRA bill, will provide dedicated funding streams. State funding streams are also opening, but in the end, an agency with bonding authority will be needed to support statewide coastal resilience. 40 Supplementary Chapter 3: Building a Resilient Coastline for Boston BOSTON CLIMATE PROGRESS REPORT 2022 4411",
