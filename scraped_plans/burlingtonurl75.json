While the number of jobs increased by 20 percent from 1990 to 2013 (green bar on the left side), energy use per job decreased by 21 percent (first blue bar) and the carbon intensity of the energy used in the commercial and industrial sector fell by 11 percent (second blue bar).

We have a shared fate as individuals within a community and communities within society. All communities need the ability to shape their own present and future.

These inequities primarily result from ongoing institutional racial bias and historical discriminatory If an equity lens is not applied, initiatives to reduce practices that have resulted in the inequitable carbon emissions may widen and exacerbate these distribution of resources and access to opportunities. disparities.

However, while this plan is fundamentally intended to respond to climate change, it will only be successful if it does so in ways that create jobs, advance social equity, improve public health, strengthen natural systems and enhance quality of life. These co-benefits are key opportunities to leverage the impact of the Climate Action Plan. PUBLIC HeALTH Climate change presents a significant risk to the health of the community. Increases in heat related illness, asthma and vector borne diseases are just some health-related impacts of a changing climate, and these impacts will compound the health inequities that already exist. Actions to reduce carbon emissions and prepare for the impacts of climate change can result in significant benefits to community members’ health and quality of life, particularly if health outcomes are a consideration in their design and implementation.

Since 2001, job growth in clean technology fields such as green building, energy efficiency and waste management has outpaced other economic sectors. Dramatically expanded emissions reduction efforts can generate a similar positive economic effect.

The impacts on and benefits to these communities will be explicitly addressed in program design and implementation of the Climate Action Plan. Approaches include:  Targeted energy upgrades, or those that focus limited investment dollars on the most cost-effective measures first, that help neutralize the cost burden of energy retrofits for income-qualified buildings or homes.  Increased incentives for income-qualified households. Energy Trust’s Savings Within Reach program is an effective example of this approach.  Programs like MPower Oregon (www.mpoweroregon.com) that enable owners of affordable multifamily housing properties to access unsecured financing and to share energy savings benefits with tenants, some of whom are among the most vulnerable residents of Multnomah County.  Green lease mechanisms that enable a fair proportion of costs and benefits to be allocated to both tenants and landlords. The City and County can help educate property owners and managers about emerging financing and leasing tools. Programs should reach deeper into communities Opportunities for low-income populations and communities of color to participate in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs must be expanded and enhanced. This not only impacts how energy efficiency and renewable energy programs are designed, but in how they are communicated and marketed. For example, currently, program messages may not ever reach immigrant and refugee communities or communities of color. Designing equitable and inclusive clean energy programs requires the thoughtful involvement of and coordination with diverse partner agencies and stakeholders. The pursuit of efficiency and renewables in meeting climate objectives should benefit, not burden low-income populations and communities of color. Effective strategies exist to share the employment, environmental and economic benefits of infrastructure investments with all residents of Multnomah County. 63BUILDINgs AND eNeRgY BUILDINgs AND eNeRgY 2030 OBJeCTIVe 1 Reduce the total energy use of all buildings built before 2010 by 25 percent. Because buildings last for many decades, more than half of the buildings that will exist in 2050 already exist today. Efforts to reduce emissions from buildings need to address both existing structures and new construction. From 2008 to 2013, total energy use in residential and commercial buildings decreased by four percent, due both to new programs like Clean Energy Works and the Kilowatt Crackdown and to the Energy Trust’s foundational programs. This progress is encouraging, but existing programs and policies alone are unlikely to achieve the 25 percent reduction. The actions described below will support, enhance and accelerate building energy efficiency programs through partnerships and policy.

The best time to begin addressing building efficiency is in the initial building design stage. Buildings that have been designed and built with performance as a primary goal are capable of significantly outperforming similar, previously built buildings that have been retrofitted for efficiency. Because total emissions from buildings must be reduced by much more than can be accomplished with retrofits alone, it is critical that buildings built after 2030 generate more energy from clean sources than they consume, resulting in a net emissions reduction. In the last three years, several homebuilders and developers have pioneered the design of net-zero energy projects in the Portland area, and even more have adopted the Architecture 2030 targets into their projects. Still, few new building construction projects are seeking this high level of performance. The actions below are intended to move new development toward nearly-zero energy building design and ensure that more efficient standards result in actual energy savings.

Oregon law requires that by 2025, 25 percent of all electricity sold by Portland General Electric and Pacific Power in Oregon be generated from new renewable energy sources. Some of these sources will take the form of utility-scale solar and wind farms, often located far from population centers. Neighborhood-scale energy system and distributed generation, like on-site solar, provide an important opportunity for renewable energy generation in an urban setting. The City and County, along with key partners like US Department of Energy, Energy Trust of Oregon, Oregon Department of Energy and Solar Oregon, have made encouraging strides in transforming the market for solar energy since 2009, adding more than 2,000 systems totaling 10 megawatts of installed capacity.

One of the challenges of an increasingly dense urban area will be delivering groceries, clothing, office supplies and online products to consumers while locally manufactured products need to be shipped out. Not only will the amount of freight movement increase, but the community prefers that it move with less noise, parking needs and pollution. Accommodating freight movement requires ongoing partnerships among the business community, logistics industry, local governments and community interests. Central to the efficiency of the freight system is the location of industrial areas and the integration with the regional transportation system. The Portland area is a major freight hub, with strong shipping, rail, barge and highway interconnections.

Portland’s 2007 requirement that all fuel sold in the city contain minimum amounts of biofuels, which have lower carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels, has been a success. Oregon has also supported the increased use of biofuels through the implementation of a statewide renewable fuel standard in 2011. In 2009, the State of Oregon authorized a statewide low-carbon fuel standard that will take into account lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. By 2020, the standard will require a 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels from 2010 levels. Electric and natural gas vehicles also provide a key opportunity to reduce the lifecycle carbon emissions of transportation fuels. As of 2015, there were over 5,600 electric vehicles registered in Oregon, with nearly 1,600 of those registered in Multnomah County.

Residents of Multnomah County can reduce the impact of food choices on climate change — and improve personal, environmental and economic health — by choosing “low-carbon” foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Lifecycle analysis shows that beef, cheese, pork and farmed salmon generate the most carbon emissions per ounce (Environmental Working Group, 2011). Although eating locally produced food has a smaller impact than choosing low-carbon food, the consumption of local food can reduce local transportation emissions, strengthen the local economy, help preserve the region’s agricultural land base and support a community-based food system that can reshape our relationship with food.

Reduce effective impervious areas by 600 acres. expand the urban forest canopy to cover at least one-third of the city, with a minimum canopy cover of 25 percent of each residential neighborhood and 15 percent of the central city, commercial and industrial areas. In addition to providing a critical role in preparing for climate change, trees and other green infrastructure help the City and County reach carbon reduction goals by sequestering carbon dioxide and reducing building energy use through cooling and shading in summer and lessening heat loss in winter. Actions in this plan focus on retaining the existing tree canopy and understory, increasing planting of diverse large-species trees where appropriate, and keeping trees healthy through an active maintenance program. As of 2010, Portland’s urban forest covered 30 percent of the city and is estimated to sequester over 88,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually. Proactive tree protection and planting beyond replacement levels will help the City meet or exceed the one-third canopy cover target for the city and increase the urban forest’s ability to sequester carbon. In doing so, a focus on increasing equitable tree canopy distribution across Portland neighborhoods is critical. Reducing impervious area helps retain space for trees, vegetation, soil and other green infrastructure as the community grows. Creative site development, retrofitting existing development and proactive depaving efforts will be needed to achieve the goal of a 600-acre net reduction of effective impervious area by 2030. Community partnerships and participation are essential to achieving these goals over time.

In Oregon, increasing temperatures and shifts in seasonal precipitation patterns are already evident. For example, reduced mountain snowpack and earlier springtime melting of snow are decreasing summer river and stream flows, making it more difficult to meet both out-of-stream and in-stream needs (Dalton, et al., 2013). More locally, the Portland region has experienced an increase in average temperatures of 0.5 ºF to 1 ºF in the past century (Washington State Climatologist). The average annual temperature in the Pacific Northwest is projected to increase 3.3 ºF to 9.7 ºF by 2100 (depending on future carbon emission scenarios), with greater warming happening in the summers (Dalton et al., 2013). Climate models for the Pacific Northwest region also project that, by the year 2100, summer precipitation may decrease by as much as 30 percent (Mote & Salathé, 2010). By 2050, on average, snowmelt is projected to begin earlier in the Cascades, and summer stream flows are expected to be lower (Dalton et al., 2013). In addition, winters may see an increased potential for more intense rain events (Dalton et al., 2013). 107CLIMATe CHANge PRePARATION LOCAL IMPACTs FROM CLIMATe CHANge Potential impacts from hotter, drier summers Potential impacts from warmer winters with with more high-heat days the potential for more intense rain events Human systems  Heat-related illness (heat stroke, heat exhaustion)  Demands on emergency response services during and exacerbation of existing medical conditions. flooding events.  Increased demand for cooling centers, especially for  Changes to mosquito populations requiring populations most vulnerable to heat. additional vector control efforts, including  Earlier and extended allergy seasons and exposure prevention at home. to wildfire smoke affecting those with asthma and  Increase in mold spores, which can trigger asthma respiratory disease. and other chronic health conditions.  Higher electricity bills due to less hydropower  Reduced energy use to heat buildings. production and increased need for air conditioning.

Temperatures in Portland tend to be the coolest in Forest Park and neighborhoods with high concentrations of trees and less development. Higher temperatures are recorded along freeways and busy roads (e.g., 82nd Ave., Sandy Blvd., Foster Road and Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd.), and in industrial areas (e.g., central east side, northwest and the Columbia corridor). 111122CLIMATE ACTION PLAN | 2015 CLIMATe CHANge PRePARATION 2030 OBJeCTIVe 14 Reduce risks and impacts from heat, drought and wildfire by preparing for hotter, drier summers with increased incidence of extreme heat days. Hotter, drier summers may result in several significant impacts for the Portland area. Higher temperatures result in increased air pollution, such as ground-level ozone and pollen counts, exacerbating Portland’s already high incidence of respiratory illnesses and allergies. Such conditions may be further exacerbated by air quality impacts resulting from the potential of increased wildfires. Higher temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns also lead to increased surface water temperatures, reduced flows in rivers and streams and negative impacts on aquatic habitats and the fish and wildlife they support.

More intense rain events will stress Portland’s systems for managing stormwater runoff and urban flooding. Changes in the intensity of winter rains may increase the incidence of landslides, particularly following prolonged periods of precipitation that happen when the soil is already saturated with water. With more rain, groundwater levels can rise, increasing the risk of large, deep landslides. Rains of increased intensity, combined with additional population growth and development, could also increase flooding, causing far- reaching economic, social and environmental impacts similar to those Portland has experienced in the past. These impacts include water damage to homes and businesses as well as roads, railroad tracks, levees, bridges and culverts. Additional costs of emergency response, business closures, lost productivity and cleanup costs could also be expected. Warmer winters may also result in increased risk of disease from vectors such as mosquitoes. Actions are needed to prevent vector-borne illnesses, and reduce risks and impacts associated with flooding and landslides.

Responsible public policy must consider the impact of climate change, the vulnerabilities of public systems and risks of those impacts, and a clear intention to make the community more resilient. This is especially true in densely populated urban areas with a concentration of infrastructure and other assets. Climate preparedness must be routinely integrated in virtually all aspects of City and County work, including setting policy, making budget decisions, updating zoning and other codes, investing in infrastructure, delivering health services and fostering emergency preparedness. The City and County must also ensure that all residents share the benefits of taking action to prepare for climate change.

Residents, businesses, nonprofit organizations and community groups all have critical roles to play. Many businesses and organizations are improving quality of life and supporting a thriving economy while addressing climate change. Portland is home to a wide range of businesses and organizations that make resource conservation the core of their business model. Ecova, the ReBuilding Center, Free Geek, SCRAP, and GO Box, among many others, create jobs as their customers reduce carbon. Many other businesses — from Hot Lips Pizza and Elephants Delicatessen to Unico Properties and Purdy paint supplies — have prioritized carbon reduction throughout their operations.

The City and County must meaningfully engage all residents to achieve an 80 percent reduction in emissions. Each resident, business and institution has an opportunity to take action. Achieving broad and robust engagement is a two-way street. The City and County must do more to reach new communities, and residents must do more to engage local governments. The kind of bold policy initiatives that support deep carbon reductions require active community support. The City and County understand and value the critical role and democratic principle of community activism, and must be responsive to community priorities by leveraging public resources to advance community initiatives. Creating the space, time, and trust to identify shared interests and opportunities for mutual benefit is essential to achieving both climate protection and equity goals. Inequity is an issue today because past decisions created deep disparities in Portland, among many other places. An essential step to addressing these inequities is to create opportunities for people most impacted to be at the table for today’s decisions. That can only happen if policymakers and members of under-represented and under-served communities know each other, trust each other and work collaboratively toward common interests and priorities.

Two decades later, Portland and Multnomah County have achieved real results: In 2013, per person carbon emissions were 35 percent below 1990 levels, and total emissions had declined 14 percent. Moreover, many of the same efforts that led to lower carbon emissions have made Portland a more desirable place to live and work. In addition, the City and County have made progress on climate change preparation and carbon sequestration through protecting stream corridors and acquiring and restoring natural areas and floodplains. More recently, The Intertwine Alliance has developed a Regional Conservation Strategy and Biodiversity Guide for the Portland- Vancouver region that includes strategies to address climate change. Key advisory groups To develop this Climate Action Plan, Portland and To elevate equity as a key outcome of the Climate Multnomah County established two key advisory Action Plan, Portland and Multnomah County groups, a Steering Committee and an Equity Working engaged community partners to convene the Equity Group, in addition to several ad hoc technical Working Group. The Equity Working Group comprised workshops. (See inside front cover for a list of Steering participants from six local community organizations Committee and Equity Working Group members.) focused on advancing equity, each with a different constituency and focus. The Equity Working Group The Steering Committee was made up of 20 members provided recommendations on the draft proposed with a wide range of experiences and expertise Climate Action Plan objectives and actions as well as representing a cross-section of community interests. overarching priorities and guidance for implementation.

Three years after the 2009 climate plan was Group and the equity scan of the 2009 Climate Action adopted, the City of Portland completed the Portland Plan resulted in this Climate Action Plan’s Equity Plan, which identified equity as the overarching strategy Commitments (see Implementation Chapter, page 132) of the City’s 25-year strategic plan. and Climate Equity Objectives (see Appendix 1, page 148) and helped to shape the 2050 Vision (pages 2–3). In consultation with the Equity Working Group, City and County staff used the Equity Objectives to evaluate opportunities and unintended consequences for the proposed objectives and actions and to develop an implementation guide. 137CLIMATe ACTION PLAN DeVeLOPMeNT PROCess Climate Action Considerations Climate Action Plan Management Process The objectives and actions contained in this Climate Action Plan were prioritized The City and County recognize that the Climate Action Plan must chart a course based on several considerations, including the action’s potential to: while allowing for adaptive management, incorporating and building on lessons learned as it is implemented.

To the greatest extent practical, actions are designed to maximize health, safety and economic benefits to local residents or businesses, make wise use of City and County operating budgets and strengthen natural systems. Acquire funding through existing or potential financial resources. Except where otherwise indicated, the actions included in the plan can be funded through existing programs or can reasonably receive the funding required for implementation from other internal or external sources, including grants. Deliver results within the City or County’s sphere of influence. Although action must be taken at all levels of government and the private sector to address climate change, this plan focuses on actions that the City and County are positioned to carry out and that will encourage or mandate change in all sectors of the community. 138CLIMATE ACTION PLAN | 2015 139CLIMATe ACTION PLAN DeVeLOPMeNT PROCess Related Planning efforts The Climate Action Plan has close links to a number of local and regional plans. These plans work together toward creating a vibrant, prosperous, healthy, equitable, resilient and low-carbon community. Climate Change Preparation Strategy and Risk and Vulnerabilities Assessment These documents serve as the City and County’s shared foundation for the climate change preparation-related actions outlined in this Climate Action Plan and seek to: (1) reduce climate-related vulnerabilities for residents and businesses, and (2) respond to impacts when they do occur. The Risk and Vulnerabilities Assessment provides an overview of the science and a more detailed review of the potential impacts to health and human systems, natural systems, infrastructure and the built environment. PREPARING FOR LOCAL IMPACTS The climate change preparation actions outlined in this Climate IN PORTLAND AND MULTNOMAH COUNTY | 2014 Action Plan (see page 106) build on the existing work of these two documents to understand how climate affects the community today, how those effects are expected to change in the coming century, and what can be done to prepare.

The strategies also overarching strategic plan. It includes four strategies provide a framework for meeting Portland’s 12 measures designed to improve prosperity, education, health and of success, many of which relate directly to the goals and equity throughout the city and for all Portlanders: objectives in this Climate Action Plan, including reduced carbon emissions, complete neighborhoods, transit and  A Framework for Equity active transportation, equity and inclusion, healthier people  Thriving Educated Youth and growing businesses.  Economic Prosperity and Affordability A Framework for Equity represents a change in the  Healthy Connected City way Portland works — how the City government and partners make decisions, invest and engage with Portlanders and each other to measure success. The framework includes “We will” statements that are policies that set the ground rules for how the City of Portland and its partners act. The framework also outlines the outcomes Portlanders would like to achieve and the means that should be used to create a more equitable city. The Climate Action Plan’s development process and content reflects the goals of the Portland Plan’s prosperous. educAted. HeAltHy. equitAble. equity framework. The Healthy Connected City Strategy introduces the concept of “complete neighborhoods” tHe to Portland. A complete neighborhood provides safe and convenient access to the goods and services needed in daily life. This includes a variety of housing options, grocery stores and other commercial portlAnd services, quality public schools, public open spaces and recreational facilities, affordable active transportation options and civic amenities. Creating complete neighborhoods will help Portland meet plAn its climate action and preparedness objectives. The Urban Form and Transportation chapter of this plan (see page 72) helps to implement aspects of the complete neighborhoods concept. The Economic Prosperity and Affordability Strategy recognizes that climate action is an economic asset. Portland has served as an international model of an urban laboratory for innovation in sustainability. The City has valuable experience built on rethinking investments; examples include programs such as Clean Energy Works and Solarize Portland that have contributed to growing the market for technologies and practices that have demonstrated how job creation can accompany reducing energy use and resource consumption. This strategy and Climate Action Plan align to build on April 2012 Portland’s position and role as a sustainability leader and to bring prosperity to all residents. 141Related City and County plans Portland Comprehensive Plan — Portland’s long-range plan for the growth and development of Portland through 2035, the Comprehensive Plan guides the location of population and job growth and codifies where different types of buildings can be constructed, what types of uses are allowed, which areas should be protected from development and where the City will invest in infrastructure.

In 1997, the regional policies. Since 1973, state law has required every city and legislature granted the Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council authority county in Oregon to have a Comprehensive Plan to guide land use to set carbon emission standards for new power plants, thereby decisions. enacting the first state or federal law in the U.S. explicitly designed to Metro, Portland’s regional government, together with TriMet, the reduce carbon emissions. Ten years later, the legislature established provider of public transportation for the Portland region, has guided a new goal to reduce emissions by 75 percent below 1990 levels by investment in light-rail, mixed-used development and an integrated 2050. multimodal transportation system. These efforts are a large part of In 2005, Governor Kulongoski issued the Greenhouse Gas Emissions the local progress to date in reducing emissions and are fundamental Reduction Strategy, which identifies actions to help the state to to the long-term success in achieving the 2050 goal. reach this 75 percent emission reduction target.

The current state strategy continues to prioritize policies, programs and investments to accelerate the transition to clean energy. Oregon has already acted on several major pieces of these collective strategies, including requiring large electric utilities to source 25 percent of their power from new renewable resources by 2025, and requiring major emitters to report their carbon emissions. State law also directed Metro to assess options for achieving carbon reduction goals from the transportation sector. Metro’s Climate Smart Communities project has concluded that full implementation of existing plans can come close to realizing these goals, highlighting the need for the region to identify financial resources sufficient to implement its plans. 144CLIMATE ACTION PLAN | 2015 Federal action Local action At the federal level, both Congress and executive agencies have Locally, the City and County work with Portland State University critical roles.

        "CLIMATE ACTION PLAN | 2015 T his Climate Action Plan seeks to identify the actions the City and County can take that have the greatest potential to reduce emissions and prepare for a changing climate. However, while this plan is fundamentally intended to respond to climate change, it will only be successful if it does so in ways that create jobs, advance social equity, improve public health, strengthen natural systems and enhance quality of life. These co-benefits are key opportunities to leverage the impact of the Climate Action Plan. PUBLIC HeALTH Climate change presents a significant risk to the health of the community. Increases in heat related illness, asthma and vector borne diseases are just some health-related impacts of a changing climate, and these impacts will compound the health inequities that already exist.

        "CLIMATE ACTION PLAN | 2015 To ensure that energy efficiency upgrades do not result in increased cost burden to low-income populations and communities of color that are already under financial stress, programs must be designed with this in mind. The impacts on and benefits to these communities will be explicitly addressed in program design and implementation of the Climate Action Plan. Approaches include:  Targeted energy upgrades, or those that focus limited investment dollars on the most cost-effective measures first, that help neutralize the cost burden of energy retrofits for income-qualified buildings or homes.  Increased incentives for income-qualified households. Energy Trust’s Savings Within Reach program is an effective example of this approach.  Programs like MPower Oregon (www.mpoweroregon.com) that enable owners of affordable multifamily housing properties to access unsecured financing and to share energy savings benefits with tenants, some of whom are among the most vulnerable residents of Multnomah County.  Green lease mechanisms that enable a fair proportion of costs and benefits to be allocated to both tenants and landlords. The City and County can help educate property owners and managers about emerging financing and leasing tools. Programs should reach deeper into communities Opportunities for low-income populations and communities of color to participate in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs must be expanded and enhanced. This not only impacts how energy efficiency and renewable energy programs are designed, but in how they are communicated and marketed. For example, currently, program messages may not ever reach immigrant and refugee communities or communities of color. Designing equitable and inclusive clean energy programs requires the thoughtful involvement of and coordination with diverse partner agencies and stakeholders. The pursuit of efficiency and renewables in meeting climate objectives should benefit, not burden low-income populations and communities of color. Effective strategies exist to share the employment, environmental and economic benefits of infrastructure investments with all residents of Multnomah County. 63",

Because buildings last for many decades, more than half of the buildings that will exist in 2050 already exist today. Efforts to reduce emissions from buildings need to address both existing structures and new construction. From 2008 to 2013, total energy use in residential and commercial buildings decreased by four percent, due both to new programs like Clean Energy Works and the Kilowatt Crackdown and to the Energy Trust’s foundational programs. This progress is encouraging, but existing programs and policies alone are unlikely to achieve the 25 percent reduction.

The best time to begin addressing building efficiency is in the initial building design stage. Buildings that have been designed and built with performance as a primary goal are capable of significantly outperforming similar, previously built buildings that have been retrofitted for efficiency. Because total emissions from buildings must be reduced by much more than can be accomplished with retrofits alone, it is critical that buildings built after 2030 generate more energy from clean sources than they consume, resulting in a net emissions reduction. In the last three years, several homebuilders and developers have pioneered the design of net-zero energy projects in the Portland area, and even more have adopted the Architecture 2030 targets into their projects.

Reduce effective impervious areas by 600 acres. expand the urban forest canopy to cover at least one-third of the city, with a minimum canopy cover of 25 percent of each residential neighborhood and 15 percent of the central city, commercial and industrial areas. In addition to providing a critical role in preparing for climate change, trees and other green infrastructure help the City and County reach carbon reduction goals by sequestering carbon dioxide and reducing building energy use through cooling and shading in summer and lessening heat loss in winter. Actions in this plan focus on retaining the existing tree canopy and understory, increasing planting of diverse large-species trees where appropriate, and keeping trees healthy through an active maintenance program. As of 2010, Portland’s urban forest covered 30 percent of the city and is estimated to sequester over 88,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually. Proactive tree protection and planting beyond replacement levels will help the City meet or exceed the one-third canopy cover target for the city and increase the urban forest’s ability to sequester carbon. In doing so, a focus on increasing equitable tree canopy distribution across Portland neighborhoods is critical. Reducing impervious area helps retain space for trees, vegetation, soil and other green infrastructure as the community grows. Creative site development, retrofitting existing development and proactive depaving efforts will be needed to achieve the goal of a 600-acre net reduction of effective impervious area by 2030.

In Oregon, increasing temperatures and shifts in seasonal precipitation patterns are already evident. For example, reduced mountain snowpack and earlier springtime melting of snow are decreasing summer river and stream flows, making it more difficult to meet both out-of-stream and in-stream needs (Dalton, et al., 2013). More locally, the Portland region has experienced an increase in average temperatures of 0.5 ºF to 1 ºF in the past century (Washington State Climatologist). The average annual temperature in the Pacific Northwest is projected to increase 3.3 ºF to 9.7 ºF by 2100 (depending on future carbon emission scenarios), with greater warming happening in the summers (Dalton et al., 2013). Climate models for the Pacific Northwest region also project that, by the year 2100, summer precipitation may decrease by as much as 30 percent (Mote & Salathé, 2010).

Hotter, drier summers may result in several significant impacts for the Portland area. Higher temperatures result in increased air pollution, such as ground-level ozone and pollen counts, exacerbating Portland’s already high incidence of respiratory illnesses and allergies. Such conditions may be further exacerbated by air quality impacts resulting from the potential of increased wildfires. Higher temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns also lead to increased surface water temperatures, reduced flows in rivers and streams and negative impacts on aquatic habitats and the fish and wildlife they support.

More intense rain events will stress Portland’s systems for managing stormwater runoff and urban flooding. Changes in the intensity of winter rains may increase the incidence of landslides, particularly following prolonged periods of precipitation that happen when the soil is already saturated with water. With more rain, groundwater levels can rise, increasing the risk of large, deep landslides. Rains of increased intensity, combined with additional population growth and development, could also increase flooding, causing far- reaching economic, social and environmental impacts similar to those Portland has experienced in the past. These impacts include water damage to homes and businesses as well as roads, railroad tracks, levees, bridges and culverts. Additional costs of emergency response, business closures, lost productivity and cleanup costs could also be expected. Warmer winters may also result in increased risk of disease from vectors such as mosquitoes. Actions are needed to prevent vector-borne illnesses, and reduce risks and impacts associated with flooding and landslides.

Achieving broad and robust engagement is a two-way street. The City and County must do more to reach new communities, and residents must do more to engage local governments. The kind of bold policy initiatives that support deep carbon reductions require active community support. The City and County understand and value the critical role and democratic principle of community activism, and must be responsive to community priorities by leveraging public resources to advance community initiatives. Creating the space, time, and trust to identify shared interests and opportunities for mutual benefit is essential to achieving both climate protection and equity goals. Inequity is an issue today because past decisions created deep disparities in Portland, among many other places. An essential step to addressing these inequities is to create opportunities for people most impacted to be at the table for today’s decisions.

Two decades later, Portland and Multnomah County have achieved real results: In 2013, per person carbon emissions were 35 percent below 1990 levels, and total emissions had declined 14 percent. Moreover, many of the same efforts that led to lower carbon emissions have made Portland a more desirable place to live and work. In addition, the City and County have made progress on climate change preparation and carbon sequestration through protecting stream corridors and acquiring and restoring natural areas and floodplains. More recently, The Intertwine Alliance has developed a Regional Conservation Strategy and Biodiversity Guide for the Portland- Vancouver region that includes strategies to address climate change.

In 1997, the regional policies. Since 1973, state law has required every city and legislature granted the Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council authority county in Oregon to have a Comprehensive Plan to guide land use to set carbon emission standards for new power plants, thereby decisions. enacting the first state or federal law in the U.S. explicitly designed to Metro, Portland’s regional government, together with TriMet, the reduce carbon emissions. Ten years later, the legislature established provider of public transportation for the Portland region, has guided a new goal to reduce emissions by 75 percent below 1990 levels by investment in light-rail, mixed-used development and an integrated 2050. multimodal transportation system. These efforts are a large part of In 2005, Governor Kulongoski issued the Greenhouse Gas Emissions the local progress to date in reducing emissions and are fundamental Reduction Strategy, which identifies actions to help the state to to the long-term success in achieving the 2050 goal. reach this 75 percent emission reduction target.

The current state strategy continues to prioritize policies, programs and investments to accelerate the transition to clean energy. Oregon has already acted on several major pieces of these collective strategies, including requiring large electric utilities to source 25 percent of their power from new renewable resources by 2025, and requiring major emitters to report their carbon emissions. State law also directed Metro to assess options for achieving carbon reduction goals from the transportation sector. Metro’s Climate Smart Communities project has concluded that full implementation of existing plans can come close to realizing these goals, highlighting the need for the region to identify financial resources sufficient to implement its plans. 144",
