It would require approximately 18 miles of shore-based protection systems to its north and south. This configuration assumes that the barrier and shore-based system could be designed for compatibility with Logan Airport operations. The largest of the two gates of the OHB consid- ered for this study would be the largest built thus far and its in-water span length the longest in the world. Opening and closing gates of these types of barriers is a cumbersome process that takes several hours. The gates of these types of barriers are designed for a small number of closures over a year or more, and with SLR would be closed more frequently. For example, the gates discussed in this analysis are similar in scale to the Maeslant Barrier protecting Rotterdam. It was designed for a closure frequency of approximately once every 10 years. Studies suggest that rising sea levels could increase its closure frequency to once every 3.2 years in 2050 and once every 1.1 years in 2100.

The Inner Harbor Barrier (IHB) proposed for Boston Harbor follows the more common river- mouth siting. Large-scale barrier systems do function successfully for protecting inland areas from coastal storm surge. For example, all five storm surge gates in the Netherlands were simultaneously closed in early January 2018 as a large storm impacted the nation, and the system prevented coastal flooding (Newmark, 2018). In addition to these barriers, four to five are in the planning stage. The research tends to agree that major gates or barriers at strategic locations of the mouths of large estuaries can reduce the overall number of ancillary interventions required around the perimeter of the estuary (Jonkman et al., 2013) to protect against storm events. The gates of these types of barriers are designed for only a small number of closures over a year or more and with SLR will be closed more frequently. For example, the gates discussed in this analysis are similar in scale to the Maeslant Barrier protecting Rotterdam. It was designed for a closure frequency of approximately once every20 | Feasibility of Harbor-wide Barrier Systems to increasing rates of failure and/or operational Suppression Study (2015) lists several key con- costs to repair or prevent failures.

Lessons Learned from other Systems Applicable to boston Several proposed alignments exist for a future Boston Harbor barrier. Although common consid- erations such as tidal flushing and navigation would exist, each alignment poses unique chal- lenges and would likely necessitate the selection of a different barrier and gate type combination. Based on historic efforts, the Inner Harbor and Outer Harbor Barrier alignments (Figure 4.1) are most representative of projects constructed to date around the world. The Metro Boston Dike Barrier alignment seems to pose the greatest amount of constructability and survivability challenges because of the water depths and exposure to severe wave energy. )2m( leveL aeS naeM woleb noitces-ssrroc Legend + Only Naviation Sections Both Flow and Navigation Sections * Only Flow Sections ■ Peak Tidal Velocities > 5 m/s ■ Peak Tidal Velocities 1.5–5 m/s ■ Peak Tidal Velocities 0.5–1.5 m/s ■ Peak Tidal Velocities 0.1–0.5 m/s ■ Peak Tidal Velocities <0.1 m/s Relation between cross-section and maximum flow during average tide at storm surge barrier sites.

Although common considerations such as tidal flushing and navigation would exist, each alignment poses unique challenges and would likely necessitate the selection of a different barrier and gate type combination. Fetch and wave effects of the barrier design will be a significant consideration. Because of the open Atlantic Ocean waves, the Metro Boston Dike Barrier would require heavy armor materials, such as rock or concrete armor units, and would require gates which could withstand direct impacts from large offshore wave heights. Inside of the OHB, the remaining fetch of greater than 5 miles (8 km) prior to land could, in part, negate protec- tive properties of the barrier at the inner harbor shoreline as waves would have enough fetch to regenerate.

Jetties and rubble mound breakwaters are regu- larly built in depths of up to 50 feet, but are less common in greater depths. The alignment as pro- posed would span depths between 80 and 120 feet (Figure 4.3), and would require atypical and more expensive construction materials compared to other barrier concepts.

Any nantasket Roads barrier proposed for the outer portions of Boston Harbor or seaward would likely be required to withstand such wave conditions. In addition to design and cost challenges, constructability is a significant hurdle to advancing this concept, because of the depths along the pro- posed alignment. Notable delays would be expected due to inclement weather, logistical issues due to the remote worksite, and large 0 5,000 10,000 Feet material requirements for the feature itself. Furthermore, the location of the Metro Boston Source: National Ocean Service Dike Barrier alignment would pose unique chal- lenges.

This alignment could require additional shore protection features in the harbor to reduce wave action, which would limit the potential benefits of a barrier concept.

Future analysis would refine the number and net opening size required. However, inclusion of these environmental flow gates does not change the results of the hydrodynamic evalu- ation presented in Section 5, with the exception of local circulation enhancements. There is some flexibility in the sizing and style of these features, as is evidenced by the variation in similar con- structed projects worldwide. Whether in the Netherlands (Deltaworks), Russia (St. Petersburg), or United States (Seabrook, Fox Point), general common attributes for this type of gate include either Tainter (radial) or vertical lift gates with associated monolith and equipment. For the pur- poses of this estimation, a vertical lift gate was assumed, similar to those found on the Seabrook barrier complex in New Orleans, LA. An example image depicting a vertical lift gate is shown in the photo on page 37. While these gates are intended to protect against low-frequency events, they require regular operation to ensure functionality. However, frequent operation leads to higher maintenance costs as well as an increased risk of mechanical failure. For reference, the Maeslant flood barrier in Rotterdam © Alamy/Frans Lemmens was designed for an estimated closure frequency of once in ten years; however, it is operated for maintenance monthly (van den Brink and de Goederen, 2017). An analysis of predicted closure frequency can be found in Section 5 of this report. bARRieRS Reaches in deep water (a depth greater than five feet) were assumed to consist of concrete caisson sections which would either be constructed in place or floated to position, then sunk in place. This feature was chosen over solutions such as “combi-wall” or driven pile walls due to its ability to adapt to a variety of subsurface conditions and to better withstand harsh wave environments. Figure 4.6 provides a sketch of a concrete caisson’s cross-section with various enhancement options. The cap or top of the caisson could be designed in such a way that it could be expanded vertically or enhanced with green elements to protect from rising seas in the future. Basic quantities of the caisson feature components were calculated (as discussed in greater detail in the following section), and the cost was converted to a loaded cost per unit length, then applied over the requiredPreliminary Analysis for Boston Harbor | 37 example of vertical lift gate. © US Army Corps of Engineers total length. Caissons require less foundational support compared to other wall measures and can be placed in relatively deep water and energetic wave environments. As previously discussed, due to sediment availability concerns, any barrier could be first constructed of gray features to provide flood risk attenuation and “greened” over time as addi- tional funds and sediments are identified. These “greened” segments would consist of a caisson wall surrounded by man-made islands. The islands were assumed to be limited to areas with a maxi- mum water depth of five feet and would have an elevation approximately five feet NAVD88. A small- er flood protection berm or levee could then be constructed on top of the island platform, with overtopping protection matting (Figure 4.6). For both the green and gray immoveable portions of the barrier, it is conceivable that the features could be engineered to be built in stages or modified over time to rebuff increasing sea level and the associated increases in surge and to the feature in a future modification.

Since the tidal range remains the same with or without a barrier, basic calculations of tidal flushing would also remain similar. We carried out particle tracking simulations, in which tens of thousands of particles are tracked in Boston Harbor, for conditions with and without the OHB. With the barrier in place, results indicated specific local zones of stagnation compared to existing conditions. Generally, these areas were located adjacent to the barrier itself, as shown in Figure 5.16. This change in tidal flushing might not have significant impacts on the overall water quality within the harbor, but the results indicate that some areas would be more prone to sediment deposition and/or water stagnation (see Section Source: Woods Hole Group 6, Environmental Impacts).

This trapping of freshwater temporarily behind a tidal restriction (indicated by high chromophoric dis- solved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence, which is high in freshwater and low is seawater), is likely sensible to any marine organism transecting the estuary (e.g., fish). How this short-term deepening of freshwater, as well as potentially higher levels of possible contaminants, might affect fish migra- tion, feeding, or reproductive behavior is unknown. It should be recognized that this freshwater is released at the maximum ebb tide, so the trap- ping phenomenon is temporary. Additionally, freshwater discharge could affect the harbor during a storm event and a closed barrier. We know that elevated river discharge of low-salinity water flows rapidly along the surface (upper foot) of the harbor out into Massachusetts Bay (Chen, unpublished data). Higher resolution (~1-ft vertical layers rather than the standard ~3-ft) models can resolve this surface thin layer (Figure 6.13; Jiang, unpublished data).

In the study, we estimate both the annual value and asset (capitalized) value of ecosystem services. We calculate the total asset value of ecosystem services as the sum of two 100,000 components. One is the sum of discounted annual value flows over 100 years, and the other is a sum of additional asset (stock) values of 10,000 other ecosystem services (Figure 7.1).

Table 8.3 through132 | Feasibility of Harbor-wide Barrier Systems TABLE 8.1 key economic Analysis considerations Analysis element key considerations Hazard Data • The analysis uses 16 flood events provided by Woods Hole Group. Probabilities of each of these flood events being met or exceeded in any given year vary in the analysis based on sea level rise assumptions for that given year. • The analysis relies on a single rate of sea level rise that correlates 0-feet of sea level rise to the year 2000, 1-foot to the year 2030, 3-feet to the year 2070, and 5-feet to the year 2100. Change in flood event probabilities as a result of sea level rise for years in between these four intervals is interpolated annually Potential Losses • Include impacts to structures, their contents, and displacement costs for residents exposed Avoided to flood impacts • Do not include business interruption (lost sales and revenues from business closure), nor damage to infrastructure or regional impacts from interruptions in transportation, electrical, or water and wastewater services. As these impacts represent potential significant economic value, the potential losses avoided in this analysis are conservative estimates of risk reduction benefits gained from implementation of a Harbor Barrier. Analysis Approach • Based on aggregated parcel level and flood depth data at the census tract level • Does not consider site-specific evaluations of flood hazard data or built environment context. The aggregated analysis approach to estimating potential losses avoided resulted in outcomes with trends that differ from Climate Ready Boston (2016).* For example, Climate Ready Boston concluded with higher building damage and greater flood risk present in South Boston than other City neighborhoods. Climate Ready Boston notes that these results are likely due to large, high- value development located on the waterfront in South Boston. Built environment • Based on present-day built environment and population conditions • Does not account for future development, redevelopment, or population growth. While current projections are that population and the built environment will continue to grow into the future, such factors are likely to be heavily affected by decisions made by the City and its constituents related to climate adaptation planning and additional investments and market signals over the coming decades. * The aggregated analysis uses median structure square footage and height information across a census tract. In the case where there is a large census tract with a mix of structure types and sizes, the potential losses avoided are tempered by the aggregated structure information. Large developments on the waterfront at risk of frequent flooding from high-probability events are not captured to the same degree that a site-specific analysis would accomplish. This yielded conservatively low results in areas dominated by waterfront high rises.

There is a large increase in the magnitude freshwater discharge coming out of the Charles of the population exposed to flooding in BostonPreliminary Analysis for Boston Harbor | 177 from the 1 % storm in 2100 under a moderate SLR scenario compared to the present number. There is not a large difference in the number that would be protected by the IHB and OHB in 2100. This is partly explained by limitations in the analysis as well as by the protection the inner barrier would provide to not only residents directly on the coast, but also those inland impacted by flood pathways originating on the coast; many of the same areas in Boston protected by the outer barrier. For both the inner and outer barriers, there are not significant percentage differences in the protected populations by category of social vulnerability compared to the Boston population as a whole without any flooding. Recommendations Based upon the findings of this project, it is clear that shore-based adaptation strategies, if effective, have clear advantages over harbor-wide strategies for Boston at least for several decades. The same likely applies to other municipalities in Boston Harbor. The analysis has shown that, while a harbor-wide barrier system would manage coastal flooding with perhaps minimal environmental im- shore-based solutions would be needed in any pacts and moderate impacts on harbor users, case over the next few decades to manage coastal its cost-effectiveness is low, and its operational flooding during the design and construction period period might extend only 50 to 60 years.

Fur- thermore, two scenarios for shore-based solution effectiveness exist: total effectiveness (the shore- line solutions will perform perfectly and provide protection up to the design elevation, with the Harbor Barrier configuration capturing incremen- tal loss above the design elevation as benefits provided by a barrier alignment), and total failure (shoreline solutions would not perform in the occurrence of a flood event greater than the design elevation).

This configuration assumes that the barrier and shore-based system could be designed for compatibility with Logan Airport operations. The largest of the two gates of the OHB consid- ered for this study would be the largest built thus far and its in-water span length the longest in the world. Opening and closing gates of these types of barriers is a cumbersome process that takes several hours. The gates of these types of barriers are designed for a small number of closures over a year or more, and with SLR would be closed more frequently. For example, the gates discussed in this analysis are similar in scale to the Maeslant Barrier protecting Rotterdam. It was designed for a closure frequency of approximately once every 10 years. Studies suggest that rising sea levels could increase its closure frequency to once every 3.2 years in 2050 and once every 1.1 years in 2100.

The Inner Harbor Barrier (IHB) proposed for Boston Harbor follows the more common river- mouth siting. Large-scale barrier systems do function successfully for protecting inland areas from coastal storm surge. For example, all five storm surge gates in the Netherlands were simultaneously closed in early January 2018 as a large storm impacted the nation, and the system prevented coastal flooding (Newmark, 2018). In addition to these barriers, four to five are in the planning stage. The research tends to agree that major gates or barriers at strategic locations of the mouths of large estuaries can reduce the overall number of ancillary interventions required around the perimeter of the estuary (Jonkman et al., 2013) to protect against storm events. The gates of these types of barriers are designed for only a small number of closures over a year or more and with SLR will be closed more frequently. For example, the gates discussed in this analysis are similar in scale to the Maeslant Barrier protecting Rotterdam. It was designed for a closure frequency of approximately once every",

Based on historic efforts, the Inner Harbor and Outer Harbor Barrier alignments (Figure 4.1) are most representative of projects constructed to date around the world. The Metro Boston Dike Barrier alignment seems to pose the greatest amount of constructability and survivability challenges because of the water depths and exposure to severe wave energy. )2m( leveL aeS naeM woleb noitces-ssrroc Legend + Only Naviation Sections Both Flow and Navigation Sections * Only Flow Sections ■ Peak Tidal Velocities > 5 m/s ■ Peak Tidal Velocities 1.5–5 m/s ■ Peak Tidal Velocities 0.5–1.5 m/s ■ Peak Tidal Velocities 0.1–0.5 m/s ■ Peak Tidal Velocities <0.1 m/s Relation between cross-section and maximum flow during average tide at storm surge barrier sites.

Although common considerations such as tidal flushing and navigation would exist, each alignment poses unique challenges and would likely necessitate the selection of a different barrier and gate type combination. Fetch and wave effects of the barrier design will be a significant consideration. Because of the open Atlantic Ocean waves, the Metro Boston Dike Barrier would require heavy armor materials, such as rock or concrete armor units, and would require gates which could withstand direct impacts from large offshore wave heights. Inside of the OHB, the remaining fetch of greater than 5 miles (8 km) prior to land could, in part, negate protec- tive properties of the barrier at the inner harbor shoreline as waves would have enough fetch to regenerate.

Future analysis would refine the number and net opening size required. However, inclusion of these environmental flow gates does not change the results of the hydrodynamic evalu- ation presented in Section 5, with the exception of local circulation enhancements. There is some flexibility in the sizing and style of these features, as is evidenced by the variation in similar con- structed projects worldwide. Whether in the Netherlands (Deltaworks), Russia (St. Petersburg), or United States (Seabrook, Fox Point), general common attributes for this type of gate include either Tainter (radial) or vertical lift gates with associated monolith and equipment. For the pur- poses of this estimation, a vertical lift gate was assumed, similar to those found on the Seabrook barrier complex in New Orleans, LA. An example image depicting a vertical lift gate is shown in the photo on page 37. While these gates are intended to protect against low-frequency events, they require regular operation to ensure functionality. However, frequent operation leads to higher maintenance costs as well as an increased risk of mechanical failure. For reference, the Maeslant flood barrier in Rotterdam © Alamy/Frans Lemmens was designed for an estimated closure frequency of once in ten years; however, it is operated for maintenance monthly (van den Brink and de Goederen, 2017). An analysis of predicted closure frequency can be found in Section 5 of this report. bARRieRS Reaches in deep water (a depth greater than five feet) were assumed to consist of concrete caisson sections which would either be constructed in place or floated to position, then sunk in place. This feature was chosen over solutions such as “combi-wall” or driven pile walls due to its ability to adapt to a variety of subsurface conditions and to better withstand harsh wave environments. Figure 4.6 provides a sketch of a concrete caisson’s cross-section with various enhancement options. The cap or top of the caisson could be designed in such a way that it could be expanded vertically or enhanced with green elements to protect from rising seas in the future. Basic quantities of the caisson feature components were calculated (as discussed in greater detail in the following section), and the cost was converted to a loaded cost per unit length, then applied over the required",

Caissons require less foundational support compared to other wall measures and can be placed in relatively deep water and energetic wave environments. As previously discussed, due to sediment availability concerns, any barrier could be first constructed of gray features to provide flood risk attenuation and “greened” over time as addi- tional funds and sediments are identified. These “greened” segments would consist of a caisson wall surrounded by man-made islands. The islands were assumed to be limited to areas with a maxi- mum water depth of five feet and would have an elevation approximately five feet NAVD88. A small- er flood protection berm or levee could then be constructed on top of the island platform, with overtopping protection matting (Figure 4.6). For both the green and gray immoveable portions of the barrier, it is conceivable that the features could be engineered to be built in stages or modified over time to rebuff increasing sea level and the associated increases in surge and to the feature in a future modification.

Since the tidal range remains the same with or without a barrier, basic calculations of tidal flushing would also remain similar. We carried out particle tracking simulations, in which tens of thousands of particles are tracked in Boston Harbor, for conditions with and without the OHB. With the barrier in place, results indicated specific local zones of stagnation compared to existing conditions. Generally, these areas were located adjacent to the barrier itself, as shown in Figure 5.16. This change in tidal flushing might not have significant impacts on the overall water quality within the harbor, but the results indicate that some areas would be more prone to sediment deposition and/or water stagnation (see Section Source: Woods Hole Group 6, Environmental Impacts).

In coastal areas not affected by glacial processes, there is a gradual fining of bottom sediment with increasing water depth and distance from shore. This is not the case in Boston Harbor due to the deglaciation processes that shaped the harbor seafloor. Boston Harbor has heterogeneous sediment distribution with dissolved water patches of silt/clay (mud) dispersed among the 02 clarity other major sediment types (Li et al., 2010).

Eels, skate, sand lances, juvenile lobsters, and other fish species also make use of muddy subtidal regions. The muddy subtidal areas also support a rich diversity of marine polychaetes, oligochaetes, and platyhelminths (worms); amphipods; gastro- pods (snails); and several clam species where mud sediments are not too fine (Stevenson et al., 2014; Pembroke et al., 2016). Muddy subtidal areas are impacted by tidal currents, tidal exchange, and sediment resuspen- sion during storm events and deposition post- storm. In the project area, the muddy subtidal Predicted Sediments with Inner Barrier Predicted Sediments with Outer Barrier has recovered substantially from earlier pollution (Taylor, 2011), although pockets of polluted and anaerobic sediments remain. This is particularly true in industrial or formerly industrial areas and in inner regions of the harbor with lower current velocities and limited water exchange (Kalnejais et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010). This habitat is rated with a quality of 3 (Figure 6.10). Muddy subtidal areas are likely to expand slightly with a 5-foot rise in sea level and become finer-grained as the additional water depths fur- ther reduce the wave and tidal energy reaching the seafloor.

        "132 | Feasibility of Harbor-wide Barrier Systems TABLE 8.1 key economic Analysis considerations Analysis element key considerations Hazard Data • The analysis uses 16 flood events provided by Woods Hole Group. Probabilities of each of these flood events being met or exceeded in any given year vary in the analysis based on sea level rise assumptions for that given year. • The analysis relies on a single rate of sea level rise that correlates 0-feet of sea level rise to the year 2000, 1-foot to the year 2030, 3-feet to the year 2070, and 5-feet to the year 2100. Change in flood event probabilities as a result of sea level rise for years in between these four intervals is interpolated annually Potential Losses • Include impacts to structures, their contents, and displacement costs for residents exposed Avoided to flood impacts • Do not include business interruption (lost sales and revenues from business closure), nor damage to infrastructure or regional impacts from interruptions in transportation, electrical, or water and wastewater services. As these impacts represent potential significant economic value, the potential losses avoided in this analysis are conservative estimates of risk reduction benefits gained from implementation of a Harbor Barrier. Analysis Approach • Based on aggregated parcel level and flood depth data at the census tract level • Does not consider site-specific evaluations of flood hazard data or built environment context. The aggregated analysis approach to estimating potential losses avoided resulted in outcomes with trends that differ from Climate Ready Boston (2016).* For example, Climate Ready Boston concluded with higher building damage and greater flood risk present in South Boston than other City neighborhoods. Climate Ready Boston notes that these results are likely due to large, high- value development located on the waterfront in South Boston. Built environment • Based on present-day built environment and population conditions • Does not account for future development, redevelopment, or population growth. While current projections are that population and the built environment will continue to grow into the future, such factors are likely to be heavily affected by decisions made by the City and its constituents related to climate adaptation planning and additional investments and market signals over the coming decades. * The aggregated analysis uses median structure square footage and height information across a census tract. In the case where there is a large census tract with a mix of structure types and sizes, the potential losses avoided are tempered by the aggregated structure information. Large developments on the waterfront at risk of frequent flooding from high-probability events are not captured to the same degree that a site-specific analysis would accomplish. This yielded conservatively low results in areas dominated by waterfront high rises.

These changing probabilities have a significant effect on annualized values, which are greater for more frequent flood events due $291B to the cumulative impacts of flooding over time. $174B $23B The evolution of probability of event occurrence over time is accounted for through a regression 0.1% 1% 2% 10% 0.1% 1% 2% 10% analysis; analysts gathered water surface eleva- Single-event expected Losses Annualized Risk Associated with tions for each of the sixteen flood scenarios from 3 foot SLR Secnario Single-event expected Losses 3 foot SLR Secnario Source: Arcadis",

        "Preliminary Analysis for Boston Harbor | 177 from the 1 % storm in 2100 under a moderate SLR scenario compared to the present number. There is not a large difference in the number that would be protected by the IHB and OHB in 2100. This is partly explained by limitations in the analysis as well as by the protection the inner barrier would provide to not only residents directly on the coast, but also those inland impacted by flood pathways originating on the coast; many of the same areas in Boston protected by the outer barrier. For both the inner and outer barriers, there are not significant percentage differences in the protected populations by category of social vulnerability compared to the Boston population as a whole without any flooding. Recommendations Based upon the findings of this project, it is clear that shore-based adaptation strategies, if effective, have clear advantages over harbor-wide strategies for Boston at least for several decades. The same likely applies to other municipalities in Boston Harbor. The analysis has shown that, while a harbor-wide barrier system would manage coastal flooding with perhaps minimal environmental im- shore-based solutions would be needed in any pacts and moderate impacts on harbor users, case over the next few decades to manage coastal its cost-effectiveness is low, and its operational flooding during the design and construction period period might extend only 50 to 60 years.

Analysts used ArcGIS to select impacted parcels and applied USACE depth-damage functions to generate expected impacts.
