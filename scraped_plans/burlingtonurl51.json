The proposed horizontal directional drill (HDD) route lies west (seaward) of the General Edwards Memorial Bridge. The project site that would facilitate the HDD in Lynn is located along the Lynn Harbor shoreline on filled tidelands and is a capped landfill. This site is predominately barren due to activities associated with the landfill. The parcel in Revere is a yacht club located in a residential neighborhood. The club’s parking lot would be used as the HDD exit site. Describe the proposed project and its programmatic and physical elements: MWRA's Section 56 Water Pipeline helps provide water to portions of Lynn, Lynnfield, Marblehead, Nahant, Peabody, Revere, Saugus, and Swampscott. The section of this water pipeline to be replaced was previously attached to the General Edwards Bridge over the Saugus River (which is also Lynn/Revere municipal border), but had to be removed in 2018 due to severe corrosion. MWRA now proposes to replace this section of water pipeline by installing a new section in the ground under the water of the Saugus River. This project will ensure water system redundancy and reliability for residents and businesses in these communities, which is crucial to protecting public and environmental health. This project involves the installation of approximately 4,800 feet of water pipeline, using both open-cut and trenchless underwater pipeline construction methods. Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) will be used to install the water pipeline in the ground under the water at the of mouth of Saugus River, from points in Lynn and Revere. HDD is a trenchless method of installing underground utilities particularly suited for installing pipeline beneath obstructions and minimizing surface impacts. A hole is drilled in a relatively shallow arc within which the pipe is subsequently inserted. Additional pipeline will be installed in existing roadways and paved areas in Lynn and Revere using open-cut methods to connect the underwater portion of the replacement pipeline to MWRA's existing Section 56 pipeline alignment, located in Route 1A. The objective of the project is to install a replacement water main. HDD has been selected due to its minimal surface impacts and lack of permanent alterations to the project site. The major components of the project are as follows: • Installation of 20-inch diameter water main and appurtenances, including fittings, valves, air release valves, and blow-offs in Hanson Street in Lynn, from the existing Section 56 pipeline in Route 1A to the Saugus River HDD crossing point. • Installation of a 20-inch water main (HDD Route 7) under the Saugus River using HDD methods. The HDD section of the water main is approximately 2,800 feet long. • Installation of 20-inch water main including fittings, valves, air release valves, and blow- offs in Rice Avenue in Revere, from the Saugus River HDD crossing point at the Point of Pines Yacht Club (HDD Route 7) to the existing Section 56 pipeline between the Route 1A northbound onramp and the Lynnway. • All other required work during construction, including but not limited to environmental controls, traffic management, replacement of utilities, surface restoration, road reconstruction and pavement restoration, and sidewalk reconstruction. The project is anticipated to take twelve months and is limited to the geographic extent shown in Figure 1 in Attachment A. Please see Attachment A, Section 2, for further details on the - 4 -project and its programmatic and physical elements. Please see Attachment A, Section 5, for a discussion of the project’s direct and indirect impacts. NOTE: The project description should summarize both the project’s direct and indirect impacts (including construction period impacts) in terms of their magnitude, geographic extent, duration and frequency, and reversibility, as applicable. It should also discuss the infrastructure requirements. of the project and the capacity of the municipal and/or regional infrastructure to sustain these requirements into the future. Describe the on-site project alternatives (and alternative off-site locations, if applicable) considered by the proponent, including at least one feasible alternative that is allowed under current zoning, and the reasons(s) that they were not selected as the preferred alternative: The following project alternatives were considered by the proponent during the June 2017 Feasibility Study for Section 56 General Edwards Bridge Crossing of the Saugus River. Please see Attachment M for the Feasibility Study and the Route Selection Matrix. • A “No Action” alternative would result in the Section 56 pipeline remaining out of service. This pipeline provides a necessary redundancy in the water supply system, and without it, the MWRA Northern High Service Zone is vulnerable to failure. As a result, the No-Action alternative was dismissed. • Open trench river crossing: The open trench river crossing alternative was comparable in cost to HDD options but included greater environmental risk, greater permitting difficulty, and longer schedule duration and was thus abandoned. • Microtunneling: The microtunneling alternative was rated favorably from a performance and risk perspective but was ultimately abandoned due to having the highest cost and longer schedule duration. • Removal and replacement on the General Edwards Bridge: The pipe replacement on the bridge alternative scored less favorably due to reduced protection against damage, hydraulic limitations, greater technical complexity, and greater construction risk. Additionally, the General Edwards Bridge is deemed structurally deficient by MassDOT, and the Department is planning a replacement project for this 87-year-old structure. • Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD): HDD is a pipe installation method that involves drilling a guided borehole, referred to as the pilot hole, through the ground along a predetermined path from an entry point to an exit point. This method scored favorably due to lesser environmental risk, shorter scheduling duration, and greater protection against damage. • Eight potential route alignments were identified and screened with respect to pipeline performance, program risks, cost, and schedule. Of the eight routes and the four pipeline installation methods initially considered, two replacement pipeline alignments to be installed via horizontal directional drilling (HDD) construction were selected to progress for further evaluation during preliminary project design. Both alternatives extended from the eastern end of Hanson Street in Lynn to Rice Avenue in Revere. Following the geotechnical investigation, a preferred pipeline placement was identified (Route 7) due to the less disruptive impacts on residents in the Point of Pines neighborhood. The Route 7 Alternative was ultimately deemed the preferred alternative for the project and is presented as the proposed project in this EENF. NOTE: The purpose of the alternatives analysis is to consider what effect changing the parameters and/or siting of a project, or components thereof, will have on the environment, keeping in mind that the objective of the MEPA review process is to avoid or minimize damage to the environment to the greatest extent feasible. Examples of alternative projects include alternative site locations, alternative site uses, and alternative site configurations. Summarize the mitigation measures proposed to offset the impacts of the preferred alternative: - 5 -To offset the impacts of the project, the staging area has been designated in Lynn, rather than in Revere. This decision will minimize impacts to the surrounding community as the surronding area in Revere is in a residential neighborhood, while the staging area in Lynn is commercial and mostly vacant. An erosion and sediment control plan will be implemented. This program will minimize exposed soil areas through sequencing and temporary stabilization as necessary and use structural erosion and sedimentation controls, including erosion control barriers. Details of typical controls are illustrated in Attachment D. Waste materials, debris, and trash would be cleaned from the work site at the end of each day and placed in trash barrels and/or dumpsters which would be disposed of off-site. At no time during construction is the dumping of spoils material, waste, or other debris allowed into any wetland area or other unspecified location. General construction safety procedures would be followed to prevent accidents that could result in spills, releases, or other environmental damage. Activities such as fueling operations and hot work would be monitored and conducted away from sensitive resource areas. MWRA will work with the local communities to develop appropriate traffic management plans. Mitigation for dust would include watering down of the construction access road and vehicles, as needed, especially during especially windy and dry days. To minimize noise impacts during construction, best management practices (BMPs) would include the use of mufflers on construction equipment and vehicles. Construction activities would also be limited to daylight hours. MWRA will coordinate closely with the surrounding community, including landowners, businesses, and residents, before and throughout the duration of the project. MWRA will work to minimize short-term impacts from the project during construction to the maximum extent practicable. If the project is proposed to be constructed in phases, please describe each phase: It is not proposed to construct the project in phases. MWRA will coordinate closely with the surrounding community including landowners, businesses, and residents before and throughout the duration of the project. MWRA will work to minimize short-term impacts from the project during construction to the maximum extent practicable. AREAS OF CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN: Is the project within or adjacent to an Area of Critical Environmental Concern? Yes (Specify: Adjacent) No if yes, does the ACEC have an approved Resource Management Plan? _ __ Yes ___ No; Rumney Marshes ACEC Salt Marsh Restoration Plan If yes, describe how the project complies with this plan. The Marsh Restoration Plan is focused on facilitating ‘priority projects’ and local engagement in efforts to restore and expand the salt marsh area. There are currently five priority projects, which would restore a projected 96 acres of salt marsh is areas deemed to have the highest potential benefits. The plan focuses on community engagement and works with local agencies and advocacy groups to identify and act on restoration opportunities. There is also an emphasis on monitoring, which identifies restoration’s effectiveness on previously impaired marshes. This project will not interfere with the restoration plan or any of its projects. The HDD construction will not impact the marsh areas or the related projects. Will there be stormwater runoff or discharge to the designated ACEC? ___ Yes No; If yes, describe and assess the potential impacts of such stormwater runoff/discharge to the designated ACEC. N/A RARE SPECIES: Does the project site include Estimated and/or Priority Habitat of State-Listed Rare Species? (see http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/nhesp/regulatory_review/priority_habitat/priority_habitat_home.htm) Yes (Specify: Piping plover, Charadrius melodus) No A portion (4,000 sqft) of Beach in Revere will be used to store the Point of Pines (PoP) Yacht Club floats in the boating off-season. The PoP Yacht Club has been storing these floats on the beach for several seasons under an Order of Conditions from the Revere Conservation Commission. The floats will be - 6 -stored on the beach between October 1st to April 1st to avoid the sensitive range of dates for the plovers (April 1st through August 31st). HISTORICAL /ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES: Does the project site include any structure, site, or district listed in the State Register of Historic Places or the inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the Commonwealth? Yes (Specify: The Point of Pines Area REV.P is an inventoried historical area, and the Point of Pines Yacht Club REV.535 is an inventories Property.) __ No If yes, does the project involve any demolition or destruction of any listed or inventoried historic or archaeological resources? Yes (Specify__________________________________) No AECOM completed a geoarchaeological investigation of the site and coordinated with MHC and MBUAR to conclude that the site did not interfere with historic or archaeological resources. See Attachment A for more information. MHC has requested archaeological monitoring during the terrestrial installation of pipeline in Revere. WATER RESOURCES: Is there an Outstanding Resource Water (ORW) on or within a half-mile radius of the project site? Yes __ No; if yes, identify the ORW and its location. Belle Island Inlet/Rumney Marshes is located inland from the project project. It is most proximate to the Revere site (820 feet from the HDD location). The 600-acre salt marsh is located in Saugus, Massachusetts. (NOTE: Outstanding Resource Waters include Class A public water supplies, their tributaries, and bordering wetlands; active and inactive reservoirs approved by MassDEP; certain waters within Areas of Critical Environmental Concern, and certified vernal pools. Outstanding resource waters are listed in the Surface Water Quality Standards, 314 CMR 4.00.) Are there any impaired water bodies on or within a half-mile radius of the project site? Yes ___No; if yes, identify the water body and pollutant(s) causing the impairment: The “inner” portion of Lynn Harbor (MA93-52) is impaired (Enterococcus and Fecal Coliform). Is the project within a medium or high-stress basin, as established by the Massachusetts Water Resources Commission? ___Yes No STORMWATER MANAGEMENT: Generally describe the project’s stormwater impacts and measures that the project will take to comply with the standards found in MassDEP’s Stormwater Management Regulations: Best management practices for stormwater management will be incorporated into project design. Work will be conducted in compliance with the Lynn and Revere Conservation Commissions’ Order of Conditions for the project. Before the start of construction, all erosion and sedimentation controls will be approved by the Engineer and inspected by the Conservation Commissions if they so choose. The project design does not introduce new impervious surface to the project site and will not impact the quality or volume of stormwater runoff. MASSACHUSETTS CONTINGENCY PLAN: Has the project site been, or is it currently being, regulated under M.G.L.c.21E or the Massachusetts Contingency Plan? Yes (a small portion of the project site – not the entire site) No__; if yes, please describe the current status of the site (including Release Tracking Number (RTN), cleanup phase, and Response Action Outcome classification): Closed National Grid MCP disposal site on Riley Way Extension (Release Tracking Number [RTN] 3- 32437). Permanent Solution Statement with No Conditions, dated November 2014. The Conceptual Site Model for the closed National Grid site is presented in Section 4.2 in the closure report (Permanent Solution Statement with No conditions) and states the following about soil impacts: “The results of the investigation activities indicate that PAHs and metals are present in soil, and are likely related to a combination of fill material (including remnants of the timber bulkhead and asphalt pavement for Riley Way Extension), the former landfill, and the history of industrial activities in the immediate vicinity of the site; there are other no apparent sources for these compounds.” - 7 -Lead was detected in a sample along Rice Avenue in Revere during the sediment investigation. Subsequent testing of the sample’s material composition indicated the following material detected: Coal (moderate), Coal Ash (moderate), Wood Ash (light), and Asphalt (trace). Per MassDEP, a background concentration for lead in soil containing coal ash or wood ash associated with fill material is 600 mg/kg. As the lead level detected in this sample was below 600 mg/kg, it was concluded that these lead levels can be attributable to fill and is exempt from reporting to MassDEP. During the groundwater investigation, dissolved lead was detected in a groundwater sample (20B-14MW) along a short stretch of Rice Avenue in Revere. The level detected is above Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) reportable concentration and constituted a 120-day reportable condition per the MCP (MWRA notified the property owner of the condition). Is there an Activity and Use Limitation (AUL) on any portion of the project site? Yes ___ No ; if yes, describe which portion of the site and how the project will be consistent with the AUL: _____________________. Are you aware of any Reportable Conditions at the property that have not yet been assigned an RTN? Yes ___ No ; if yes, please describe:____________________________________ During AECOM’s subsurface work to assess groundwater conditions, dissolved lead was detected in a groundwater sample (20B-14MW) located along a short stretch of Rice Avenue in Revere. The lead concentrations were high enough to be considered a reportable concentration and constituted a 120-day reportable condition. In addition, the property owner was made aware of the impairment. SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTE: If the project will generate solid waste during demolition or construction, describe alternatives considered for re- use, recycling, and disposal of, e.g., asphalt, brick, concrete, gypsum, metal, wood: Materials generated during the removal of the twelve timber piles and the HDD are anticipated to yield 64 cubic yards of solid waste. Due to the deteriorated quality of the timber, there is no considered alternative use. (NOTE: Asphalt pavement, brick, concrete, and metal are banned from disposal in Massachusetts landfills and waste combustion facilities, and wood is banned from disposal at Massachusetts landfills. See 310 CMR 19.017 for the complete list of banned materials.) Will your project disturb asbestos-containing materials? Yes ___ No ; if yes, please consult state asbestos requirements at http://mass.gov/MassDEP/air/asbhom01.htm Describe anti-idling and other measures to limit emissions from construction equipment: Best management practices would be employed to reduce the impacts on air quality. This may include reducing the idling times of construction vehicles. Due to the number of vehicles and duration of activity required to perform the work being limited, emissions are not anticipated to cause an exceedance of national or state air quality standards in the vicinity of the project site. DESIGNATED WILD AND SCENIC RIVER: Is this project site located wholly or partially within a defined river corridor of a federally Designated Wild and Scenic River or a state-designated Scenic River? Yes ___ No ; if yes, specify name of the river and designation: If yes, does the project have the potential to impact any of the “outstandingly remarkable” resources of a federally Wild and Scenic River or the stated purpose of a state-designated Scenic River? Yes ___ No ; if yes, specify name of the river and designation: _____________; If yes, will the project will result in any impacts on any of the designated “outstandingly remarkable” resources of the Wild and Scenic River or the stated purposes of a Scenic River.

Identify the current municipal comprehensive land use plan Title: Next Stop Revere (Draft Master Plan) Date: January 2020 Title: Lynn Waterfront Master Plan Date: September 2019 B. Describe the project’s consistency with that plan with regard to: 1. economic development N/A, this project is unrelated to economic development 2. adequacy of infrastructure Relevant excerpts from each plan are provided below, - 10 -followed by a statement of the proposed project’s consistency with each statement. Revere: The “provision of adequate infrastructure development” is consistent with the City’s planning documents. The proposed Section 56 water main replacement is consistent with this goal because it attends to currently inadequate infrastructure. Lynn: “To achieve enhanced connectivity across many individual developments and open spaces, street and infrastructure improvement projects should be coordinated closely with private development.”The proposed project will significantly improve existing infrastructure and mitigate the risk of wastewater infrastructure failure. This will benefit the private businesses and residential areas that depend on this infrastructure. 3. open space impacts N/A, this project presents no permanent impacts on open space. 4. compatibility with adjacent land uses N/A, this project presents no permanent impacts that would be incompatible with adjacent land uses. C. Identify the current Regional Policy Plan of the applicable Regional Planning Agency (RPA) Title: MetroFuture: Greater Boston Region’s 30-year plan Date: May 2008 D. Describe the project’s consistency with that plan with regard to: 1. economic development N/A, this project is unrelated to economic development. 2. adequacy of infrastructure Relevant excerpts from the plan are provided below, followed by a statement of the proposed project’s consistency with each statement. - “Urban areas benefit from existing infrastructure and they demonstrate great potential for new growth through reuse of existing buildings and developed land.” This project will enable a return-to-service of existing infrastructure, conserving investments that would otherwise be needed to create a new water distribution main. - “The region will be prepared for and resilient to natural disasters and climate change. . .[w]ell maintained infrastructure would be more resilient to disasters.” Section 56 creates a necessary redundancy in the water supply system which would make the overall system more resilient to disaster. 3. open space impacts N/A, this project presents no permanent impacts to open space - 11 -RARE SPECIES SECTION I. Thresholds / Permits A. Will the project meet or exceed any review thresholds related to rare species or habitat (see 301 CMR 11.03(2))? ___Yes No; if yes, specify, in quantitative terms: (NOTE: If you are uncertain, it is recommended that you consult with the Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) prior to submitting the ENF.)

The second is the removal of twelve timber piles, six of which are 70 feet deep and the other six are 68 feet deep. They are tapered and thus shaped as partial cones with an upper diameter of 2 feet and a lower diameter of 0.8 feet. Will dredging impact the following resource areas? Intertidal Yes __ No; if yes, 1,900 sqft Outstanding Resource Water __Yes No; if yes, ___ sq ft Other resource area (i.e. shellfish beds, eelgrass beds) Yes __No; if yes, 1,900 sqft (coincident with the intertidal area reported above) If yes to any of the above, have you evaluated appropriate and practicable steps to 1) avoidance; 2) if avoidance is not possible, minimization; 3) if either avoidance or minimize is not possible, mitigation? Alternatives included a no-action alternative wherein the Section 56 pipeline would remain out of service. As indicated above, this pipeline provides a necessary redundancy in the water supply system, and without it, the MWRA Northern High Service Zone is vulnerable to failure. As a result, the no-action alternative was dismissed. Various construction methods and nine routes were considered as alternatives, and two were selected for geotechnical investigation. The proposed HDD route is the least disruptive to adjacent resource areas. See Attachment A for further Alternatives Analysis. If no to any of the above, what information or documentation was used to support this determination? N/A Provide a comprehensive analysis of practicable alternatives for improvement dredging in accordance with 314 CMR 9.07(1)(b). Physical and chemical data of the sediment shall be included in the comprehensive analysis. Sediment Characterization Existing gradation analysis results? Yes ___No: if yes, provide results.

Beach Nourishment ___ Unconfined Ocean Disposal ___ Confined Disposal: Confined Aquatic Disposal (CAD) ___ Confined Disposal Facility (CDF) ___ Landfill Reuse in accordance with COMM-97-001 ___ Shoreline Placement ___ Upland Material Reuse____ In-State landfill disposal____ Out-of-state landfill disposal ____ (NOTE: This information is required for a 401 Water Quality certification.) The HDD pipe will displace 93,650 cubic yards of sediment from beneath the Saugus River bed. Behind the drill rig, a series of sieves and cyclones will be used to separate the - 16 -sediment into soil and sand. These materials will be trucked off-site. The material is expected to be suitable for use as daily cover at a nearby landfill and this will be confirmed by sampling once the material is stockpiled as it is generated. It is not expected that contamination will be detected due to the depths of the sediments and distance from surface impacts. IV. Consistency: A. Does the project have effects on the coastal resources or uses, and/or is the project located within the Coastal Zone? Yes ___ No; if yes, describe these effects and the projects consistency with the policies of the Office of Coastal Zone Management: Coastal Hazards Policy #1: This policy concerns the protection of beneficial functions provided by natural coastal landforms. This project has been designed to limit permanent surface impacts to avoid impacting any coastal landforms. Returning Section 56 to service is a necessary task to protect the water supply system that serves thousands of residents. The HDD method described herein has been assessed and determined to be the most favorable alternative to minimize impact on coastal landforms. Coastal Hazards Policy #2: This policy concerns water circulation and sediment transport. This project will have no permanent impacts that would have an adverse effect on the project site or adjacent or downcoast areas. Coastal Hazards Policy #3: This policy concerns hazards presented by projects within the coastal zone. This project will have no permanent impacts that will exacerbate (or otherwise impact) existing hazards, nor promote growth in hazard-zone or buffer areas. Coastal Hazards Policy #4: This policy concerns the relocation of structures out of coastal high-hazard areas. This section of water main previously crossed the Saugus River on the General Edwards Bridge, which is a structure in a coastal high-hazard area that is scheduled to be replaced due to structural deficiency. MWRA understands that the bridge replacement is in the planning stages and will go to bid in 2028, putting construction into 2033 (with the potential of being delayed further). The replacement of the water main via HDD methods prevents a future replacement from being built above ground in the coastal high-hazard area and thus is aligned with this policy. B. Is the project located within an area subject to a Municipal Harbor Plan? Yes __ No; if yes, identify the Municipal Harbor Plan and describe the project’s consistency with that plan: The project area is located within the area subject to the Lynn Harbor Plan [1]. Central to the Lynn Harbor Plan is the signature public waterfront park (Lynn Harbor Park), and the goal of transitioning the Lynn waterfront to a new, mixed-use neighborhood. This project will ensure water supply system redundancy and resiliency for this public park, new residences, and businesses. Permanent impacts of the project will not impair public access to areas within the water-dependent use zone. 1 https://www.lynnma.gov/cityhall_documents/planning/harbor_plan/Lynn_Municipal_Harbor_Plan_2020.pdf - 17 -WAT ER SUPPLY SECTION I.

Consistency Describe measures that the proponent will take to comply with the State Solid Waste Master Plan: 26HIST ORICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES SECTION I. Thresholds / Impacts A. Have you consulted with the Massachusetts Historical Commission? Yes ___ No; if yes, attach correspondence. For project sites involving lands underwater, have you consulted with the Massachusetts Board of Underwater Archaeological Resources? Yes ____ No; if yes, attach correspondence B. Is any part of the project site a historic structure, or a structure within a historic district, in either case listed in the State Register of Historic Places or the Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the Commonwealth? ___ Yes No; if yes, does the project involve the demolition of all or any exterior part of such historic structure? ___ Yes No; if yes, please describe: C. Is any part of the project site an archaeological site listed in the State Register of Historic Places or the Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the Commonwealth? Yes ___ No; if yes, does the project involve the destruction of all or any part of such archaeological site? ___ Yes No; if yes, please describe: D. If you answered \"No\" to all parts of both questions A, B and C, proceed to the Attachments and Certifications Sections. If you answered \"Yes\" to any part of either question A or question B, fill out the remainder of the Historical and Archaeological Resources Section below. II. Impacts Describe and assess the project's impacts, direct and indirect, on listed or inventoried historical and archaeological resources: The project is anticipated to have neither direct nor indirect impacts on listed or inventoried historical and archaeological resources. The Point of Pines Area (REV.P) is an inventoried historic area, and the Point of Pines Yacht Club (REV.535) is an inventoried Property. While the project will take place in the Point of Pines Area (REV.P) and in the parking lot of the Point of Pines Yacht Club (REV.535), the project will sustain no above- ground impacts aside from the installation of three manholes in the paved roadway. Construction impacts will be temporary, located in existing paved areas (aside from the grassy shoulder at the western end of Rice Avenue), and will not result in any lasting visual changes. A marine archaeological area of potential effects (APE) was developed and investigated via a survey, which collected a combination of single beam (SB) bathymetric data, Side Scan Sonar (SSS) data, and Sub-Bottom Profiler (SBP) data collected by CE Environmental using a real-time kinematic (RTK) navigation system with an accuracy within .39 inch (1cm), the conclusion of what was that there would be low potential for significant submerged cultural resources within the proposed HDD routes. This conclusion was affirmed by the MBUAR in a communication dated September 28, 2021 (included in Attachment E). See Attachment A for further details. III. Consistency Describe measures that the proponent will take to comply with federal, state, regional, and local plans and policies related to preserving historical and archaeological resources: Per communications with BUAR and MHC (Attachment E), an archaeologist will be on site during the Rice Avenue trench excavation to identify and evaluate any intact, significant archaeological resources that may be present within the buried natural stratigraphy. 27CLIM ATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY SECTION This section of the Environmental Notification Form (ENF) solicits information and disclosures related to climate change adaptation and resiliency, in accordance with the MEPA Interim Protocol on Climate Change Adaptation and Resiliency (the “MEPA Interim Protocol”), effective October 1, 2021. The Interim Protocol builds on the analysis and recommendations of the 2018 Massachusetts Integrated State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP), and incorporates the efforts of the Resilient Massachusetts Action Team (RMAT), the inter-agency steering committee responsible for implementation, monitoring, and maintenance of the SHMCAP, including the “Climate Resilience Design Standards and Guidelines” project. The RMAT team recently released the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool, which is available here. The MEPA Interim Protocol is intended to gather project-level data in a standardized manner that will both inform the MEPA review process and assist the RMAT team in evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool. Once this testing process is completed, the MEPA Office anticipates developing a formal Climate Change Adaptation and Resiliency Policy through a public stakeholder process. Questions about the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool can be directed to rmat@mass.gov. All Proponents must complete the following section, referencing as appropriate the results of the output report generated by the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool and attached to the ENF. In completing this section, Proponents are encouraged, but not required at this time, to utilize the recommended design standards and associated Tier 1/2/3 methodologies outlined in the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool to analyze the project design. However, Proponents are requested to respond to a respond to a user feedback survey on the RMAT website or to provide feedback to rmat@mass.gov, which will be used by the RMAT team to further refine the tool. Proponents are also encouraged to consult general guidance and best practices as described in the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Guidelines. I. Climate Change Adaptation and Resiliency Strategies Has the project taken measures to adapt to climate change for all of the climate parameters analyzed in the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool (sea level rise/storm surge, extreme precipitation (urban or riverine flooding), extreme heat)? Yes ___ No Note: Climate adaptation and resiliency strategies include actions that seek to reduce vulnerability to anticipated climate risks and improve resiliency for future climate conditions. Examples of climate adaptation and resiliency strategies include flood barriers, increased stormwater infiltration, living shorelines, elevated infrastructure, increased tree canopy, etc. Projects should address any planning priorities identified by the affected municipality through the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) program or other planning efforts, and should consider a flexible adaptive pathways approach, an adaptation best practice that encourages design strategies that adapt over time to respond to changing climate conditions. General guidance and best practices for designing for climate risk are described in the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Guidelines. A. If no, explain why. B. If yes, describe the measures the project will take, including identifying the planning horizon and climate data used in designing project components. If applicable, specify the return period and design storm used (e.g., 100-year, 24-hour storm). The proposed project does not include any permanent above-ground structures associated with the Section 56 water pipeline replacement. Furthermore, there is 28no new impervious surface proposed. The portion of the pipeline below the Saugus River is greater than forty feet below the riverbed, and the connecting land portions of the pipeline are also below-grade predominantly in existing paved areas. Therefore, it is not anticipated that consideration of climate data is relevant in the proposed project. While the RMAT Climate Design Standards Tool was consulted, there are no applicable design recommendations that can be incorporated into this project. C. Is the project contributing to regional adaptation strategies? __ Yes No; If yes, describe. II. Has the Proponent considered alternative locations for the project in light of climate change risks? ___ Yes No A. If no, explain why. The project is a replacement of an existing water main that traversed the Saugus River between Lynn and Revere. No alternative location would meet the project objective. B. If yes, describe alternatives considered. III. Is the project located in Land Subject to Coastal Storm Flowage (LSCSF) or Bordering Land Subject to Flooding (BLSF) as defined in the Wetlands Protection Act? Yes ____No If yes, describe how/whether proposed changes to the site’s topography (including the addition of fill) will result in changes to floodwater flow paths and/or velocities that could impact adjacent properties or the functioning of the floodplain. General guidance on providing this analysis can be found in the CZM/MassDEP Coastal Wetlands Manual, available here. The only change in topography at the site is the removal of twelve timber piles from the dilapidated sea wall along the shoreline in Lynn. The deteriorating seawall does not offer the adjacent BLSF significant protection and the removal of this section is not anticipated to change floodwater flow paths and/or velocities. There are no other permanent proposed changes to the site’s topographies. 29ENV IRONMENTAL JUSTICE SECTION I. Identifying Characteristics of EJ Populations A. If an Environmental Justice (EJ) population has been identified as located in whole or in part within 5 miles of the project site, describe the characteristics of each EJ population as identified in the EJ Maps Viewer (i.e., the census block group identification number and EJ characteristics of “Minority,” “Minority and Income,” etc.). Provide a breakdown of those EJ populations within 1 mile of the project site, and those within 5 miles of the site. There are three municipalities within a 1-mile radius of the project site. These are Lynn, Revere, and Saugus. Within a 1-mile radius of the project site, there are 31 EJ block groups across three municipalities (Lynn, Revere, and Saugus). The project site is located within two block groups designated as environmental justice popultions in Lynn and Revere. One is on the basis of income and one on the basis of minority. There are 29 additional block groups designated as environmental justice populations either in whole or in part within the designated geographic area (i.e. within one mile of the project). A figure in Attachment I indicates the EJ criteria for each block group. Within a 5-mile radius, there are 255 EJ block groups across twelve municipalities (Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Lynn, Malden, Melrose, Peabody, Revere, Salem, Saugus, Swampscott, and Winthrop). A list of these populations is included in Attachment I. B. Identify all languages identified in the “Languages Spoken in Massachusetts” tab of the EJ Maps Viewer as spoken by 5 percent or more of the EJ population who also identify as not speaking English “very well.” The languages should be identified for each census tract located in whole or in part within 1 mile and 5 miles of the project site, regardless of whether such census tract contains any designated EJ populations. Within a 1-mile radius of the project site, there are five EJ block groups that meet this qualification (four in Lynn and one in Revere). The languages spoken are Spanish or Spanish Creole, Russian, Mon-Khmer Cambodian, and “Other Indic Language.” Within a 5-mile radius, there are 52 EJ block groups across eight municipalities that meet this qualification. Lists of these block groups are included as Attachment I. C. If the list of languages identified under Section I.B. has been modified with approval of the EEA EJ Director, provide a list of approved languages that the project will use to provide public involvement opportunities during the course of MEPA review. If the list has been expanded by the Proponent (without input from the EEA EJ Director), provide a list of the additional languages that will be used to provide public involvement opportunities during the course of MEPA review as required by Part II of the MEPA Public Involvement Protocol for Environmental Justice Populations (“MEPA EJ Public Involvement Protocol”). If the project is exempt from Part II of the protocol, please specify. In order to meet the needs of the “Other Indic Languages” category, the EJ Screening Form was translated into Urdu. Translated forms in all five languages (English, Spanish, Russian, Mon-Khmer Cambodian, and Urdu) were distributed to the CBO Distribution List, as well as the project municipalities and their Conservation Commissions and other stakeholders identified by MWRA. 30IV. Potential Effects on EJ Populations A. If an EJ population has been identified using the EJ Maps Viewer within 1 mile of the project site, describe the likely effects of the project (both adverse and beneficial) on the identified EJ population(s). The following impacts may affect EJ populations as well as the wider public: • Short-term impacts to traffic on Rice Avenue would impact residents on this street during the terrestrial pipeline installation. Increased activity in the vicinity of the project site, including the Point of Pines parking lot, would temporarily disrupt local traffic. • Short-term impacts to traffic on Hanson Street would impact traffic patterns in the commercial/industrial vicinity during the terrestrial pipeline installation. • Short-term impacts to air quality in the project area could result from the temporary operation of machinery associated with construction activities. Best management practices (BMPs) to control construction emissions would be implemented to minimize visible fugitive dust emissions at the property line. • Short-term impacts to noise levels in the project area would occur during construction, primarily from mechanical equipment used for construction activities. • Short-term impacts to the accessibility to what is named on Google Maps as “The Community Path of Lynn” and what appears to be a segment of a walking/biking trail that goes along the waterfront. This area would be restricted from public access due to its proximity to the project site. The project would result in the following benefits to EJ populations as well as the wider public: • MWRA's Section 56 water pipeline supplies water and provides water system redundancy to portions of Lynn, Lynnfield, Marblehead, Nahant, Peabody, Revere, Saugus, and Swampscott. The EJ populations served by this pipeline as well as the wider community will benefit from the security that this pipeline replacement will bring to the area’s water supply. B. If an EJ population has been identified using the EJ Maps Viewer within 5 miles of the project site, will the project: (i) meet or exceed MEPA review thresholds under 301 CMR 11.03(8)(a)- (b) __ Yes _X_ No; or (ii) generate150 or more new average daily trips (ADT) of diesel vehicle traffic, excluding public transit trips, over a duration of 1 year or more. ___ Yes No C. If you answered “Yes” to either question in Section II.B., describe the likely effects of the project (both adverse and beneficial) on the identified EJ population(s). III.

Introduction The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) is proposing to replace a section of its existing Section 56 water pipeline, which helps supply water to portions of Lynn, Lynnfield, Marblehead, Nahant, Peabody, Revere, Saugus and Swampscott. This critical pipeline had previously provided redundancy for the MWRA Northern High Service Zone prior to 2018, when a section crossing the Saugus River via the General Edwards Bridge was removed due to severe corrosion and upcoming bridge work. The Section 56 water main has since been inoperable, leaving the Northern High Service Zone without redundancy and thus vulnerable to failure. MWRA's Section 56 Pipeline Replacement Project will ensure water system redundancy and reliability for residents and businesses in these communities, which is crucial to protecting public and environmental health. MWRA’s Section 56 pipeline was initially constructed in 1934 and is located below Ocean Avenue, Revere Street, Revere Beach Boulevard, the State Route 1A North ramp, and North Shore Road (State Route 1A) in Revere. The pipeline continues in Lynn along the Lynnway (State Route 1A) and Broad Street, terminating at the intersection of Broad and Washington Streets. Section 56 primarily consists of 20-inch diameter cast iron pipes for most of its length. During the design phase of the project, four pipe installation methods and eight routes were considered. Two routes were selected for further geotechnical investigation and supplemental borings. As discussed further in Section 3.2, after a review of the alternatives analysis and in consultation with the Cities of Revere and Lynn, Route 7 and Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) were selected as the preferred alternatives and are presented in this EENF. 2. Project Description The following section provides a description of the project site, project goal, and major work activities that would be required to implement the preferred alternative. 2.1. Project Site Description and Background The project area includes sites on either side of the Saugus River in Lynn and Revere. The project boundaries in Revere are from the intersection of Route 1A North Shore Road “Lynnway” and Rice Avenue in Revere, along Rice Avenue and into the Point of Pines Yacht Club parking. The proposed pipeline route continues below the Lower Saugus River northeasterly towards Hanson Street in Lynn, then westerly along Hanson Street to the intersection of Route 1A Northern Shore Road “Lynnway” Hanson Street, in Lynn. The project's southerly and northerly terminus points connect to the existing Section 56 Saugus River Crossing water main on North Shore Road in Revere and the Lynnway in Lynn. The proposed pipeline route can be seen in Figure 1. Site photos can be found in Attachment C. 1Figure 1. The proposed pipeline route, including two terrestrial portions (Lynn and Revere), and the section beneath the Saugus River. The terrestrial portions of the proposed water main will join with the existing Section 56 pipeline at the ends of Hanson Street and Rice Avenue. 22.2. Project Goal The objective of the Project is a return to service of the Section 56 water main. Without the system redundancy previously provided by this water main, the MWRA Northern High Service Zone is vulnerable to failure. This project will reinstate system redundancy for the residents and businesses supported by this water pipeline. 2.3. Proposed Design MWRA is proposing that the portion of the Section 56 water main be replaced below the riverbed of the Saugus River between Lynn and Revere. The new water main section below the Saugus River would be installed via Horizontal Direction Drilling (HDD), with an entry pit located in Lynn near the southern end of Hanson Street and an exit pit in Revere within the Point of Pines Yacht Club parking lot. Table 1 and Figure 1 depict the limits various limits of work. Table 1. Limits of Work Area City Limit of Work Purpose (sqft) Installation of terrestrial pipeline via Rice Avenue pipeline installation 4,315 traditional cut-and-cover methods with existing paved roadway. Revere Equipment staging area for horizontal HDD Exit Staging Area (Point of Pines 13,740 directional drilling pipe string exit point. Yacht Club Parking Lot) Location is a paved parking lot. Installation of terrestrial pipeline via Hanson Street pipeline installation 10,040 traditional cut-and-cover methods with existing paved roadway. Equipment staging area for horizontal directional drilling pipe string entry point. HDD Entry Staging Area 37,050 Location is vegetated and parallels Hanson Street Extension. Access route for equipment required to Lynn remove the dilapidated timber piles along the Timber Pile Removal along Lynn Shoreline 25,590 Lynn shoreline. Route is vegetated and will need to be cleared (with stumps left in place) and will be replanted following construction. Area immediately north of the horizontal directional drilling for laying out the pipe Pipe string Layout Area 56,000 string prior to deployment. This area is necessary to ensure the pipe will enter the drill hole at the correct angle. The design elements of the proposed water main installation are illustrated in the various project plans and drawings in Attachment D. The new water main marine section would be connected to the existing pipeline on North Shore Road in Revere and the Lynnway in Lynn by water main segments installed via traditional open-cut excavation. 2.3.1 Terrestrial Pipeline Segments The on-land sections of the proposed Section 56 replacement pipeline will be installed by open- cut construction, which is the most common installation method for water mains. The trench will be opened approximately seven feet wide and will largely be within the existing paved roadways. Once the trench has been excavated to the required depth, pipe bedding material is placed in the bottom of the trench prior to installation of the pipe. The pipe will be installed section by section, and then backfilled and compaction will occur. The trench length open at any 3time will be approximately twenty to thirty feet in length (i.e., not in exceedance of the length of pipe that can reasonably be installed in one day). This length is slowly and constantly moving as construction is progressed. Trenches will be properly shored or sheeted to protect against trench collapses in accordance with all Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) trenching guidelines and requirements. In the event groundwater is encountered during the installation of the terrestrial pipeline segments, pumps and/or dewatering sumps will be used to keep the trench bottom in-the-dry during pipeline installation. Dewatering effluent will either be discharged to an upland area or an existing storm drain; in both cases, the dewatering effluent will be pumped through a silt sack/catch basin insert to reduce turbidity prior to discharge. All mains will be installed with 5 feet of cover where possible. The project will comply with applicable regulations and requirements per the NPDES Construction General Permits and NPDES Dewatering and Remediation General Permits. 2.3.2 Saugus River Crossing The Hanson Street (Lynn) and Rice Avenue (Revere) on-shore alignments will be connected via a section of pipe in the ground beneath the water of the Saugus River. It is proposed that this 34-inch diameter pipe be high-density polyethylene and installed via HDD. HDD is a method of underground utility installation that entails drilling a pilot hole at a relatively shallow angle. HDD is typically employed to avoid obstacles and minimize surface impacts. The length of the pipe beneath the Saugus River will be 2,800 feet. 2.3.3 Appurtenances The proposed 20-inch ductile iron Section 56 replacement pipeline will include pipe bends, line valves, required thrust restraints, blow-offs, and air release and vacuum valves. Horizontal bends will be installed at locations where a change of direction is required that exceeds the allowable joint deflection. Vertical bends will be installed where required to deflect the pipe above or below existing utilities, such as the 18-inch drainpipe in Rice Avenue at the Lynnway and the 36-inch culvert on Rice Avenue. No existing utilities will need to be relocated. The only above-ground impacts resulting from the installation of this water main will be six manholes. 2.3.4 Dredging Dredging will result as the water main to be installed in the ground beneath the water of the Saugus River will displace a volume of sediment (approximately 94,000 cubic yards). Additionally, twelve timber piles will need to be removed from the dilapidated seawall on the Lynn shoreline as they obstruct the proposed HDD path. Because the degraded wood piles are embedded in the ground, removal thereof is considered dredging (approximately 50 cubic yards). At this point in the design, there are two scenarios for pile removal under consideration. The first would be pile removal by land, and the second would entail the use of a barge to remove the piles. The former requires a greater land disturbance (primarily the clearing of vegetation). While the second scenario offers less impact on existing environmental conditions on land, the barge will need to be supported by spuds and temporarily grounded to the ocean floor. Environmental impacts of both scenarios (i.e., greater area of clearing on land and temporary impacts to Land Under Water) are discussed herein. See Project Plans in Attachment D and Section 5.2 for further details as to the area impacted by the proposed timber pile removals. 43. Alternatives to the Project This section summarizes the alternatives to the proposed replacement project. As noted above, the project’s purpose is to return to service the Section 56 Water Main. To meet this purpose, various pipe materials and routes were evaluated. The No Action Alternative is also discussed below. After the alternatives below were fully considered, the proposed route and HDD installation method were selected as the preferred alternative for the reasons outlined below. 3.1. No Action The no-action alternative would result in the Section 56 pipeline remaining out of service. As indicated above, this pipeline provides a necessary redundancy in the water supply system, and without it, the MWRA Northern High Service Zone is vulnerable to failure. As a result, the no- action alternative was dismissed. 3.2. Route and Installation Method Alternatives In 2017, MWRA’s consultant conducted an alternatives analysis that analyzed four pipe installation methods and nine routes for the new pipe placement. The installation methods included open trench river crossing, Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD), microtunneling, and removal and replacement on the General Edwards bridge. The microtunneling alternative was rated favorably from a performance and risk perspective but had the highest cost and longer schedule duration. The open trench river crossing alternative was comparable in cost to HDD options but included greater environmental risk, greater permitting difficulty, and longer schedule duration. The pipe replacement on the bridge alternative scored less favorably due to reduced protection against damage, hydraulic limitations, greater technical complexity, and greater construction risk. Additionally, the General Edwards Bridge is deemed structurally deficient by MassDOT, and the Department is in the planning phase of replacing this 87-year- old structure. The bid date for this project is in 2028, which puts the timeline for finishing the bridge at least five years after that (with the possibility of it being much longer). Planning to put the pipeline on the bridge would cause a significant and unacceptable delay to the pipeline replacement, which again, is necessary to ensure water supply system redundancy for several communities. The 2017 Feasibility Study can be found in Attachment M. Route alternatives were screened concerning pipeline performance, program risks, cost, and schedule. Of the nine routes initially considered, two (Routes 3 and 7) were selected to be further evaluated, which included an extensive geotechnical investigation of these two potential alignments. This work included twelve geotechnical borings, nine marine geotechnical borings, and three test pits. These geotechnical survey methods provide a better understanding of which route is less impactful to the surrounding environments. The two pipe replacement alternatives, extending from Hanson Street in the City of Lynn to Rice Avenue in the City of Revere, were designated Route 3 and Route 7. Both routes connect to the Section 56 water main in the Revere on the North Shore Road/Lynnway near the ramp onto State Route 1A North and in the Lynn on the Lynnway (State Route 1A) opposite Hanson Street. In 2020, AECOM conducted geological boring investigations along Routes 3 and 7. Although both offered feasible routes from an HDD perspective, Route 7 involves a shorter distance of open-cut trench excavation for the land portion of the connection to the existing Section 56 water pipeline in Revere and therefore is the route with less impact on the Barrier Beach System, as well as less impact on the Point of Pines community. The weighted Route Selection Matrix summarizing the scoring of Routes 3 and 7 is provided in Attachment M. Following the 5geotechnical investigation, Route 7 was identified as the preferred pipeline route due to the less disruptive impacts on the Barrier Beach System and residents in the Point of Pines neighborhood. Because both pipeline routes were under consideration at the time the geotechnical investigation was performed, Route 3 is still visible on some figures. Route 7 is the proposed Project presented in this EENF; mention of or reference to Route 3 in any supplementary documents should be disregarded with concern to the proposed project. 4. Existing Environment 4.1. Topography, Soils, and Sediment According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service soil maps, the vicinity of Hanson Street, the timber pile removal site, the HDD Entry and Staging area, and the pipe string layout area (all of which are in Lynn, Essex County) are characterized as urban land (1.5 acres) and refuse substratum Udorthents (1.9 acres). Rice Avenue and the HDD Exit Staging area are characterized as sand beach (0.1 acres), Merrimac-Urban land complex 0 to 8 percent slopes (0.4 acres), and wet substratum Udorthents (<0.1 acres). Based on the Surficial Materials Map of the Lynn Quadrangle, Massachusetts, published by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 2018, surficial geology at the project site consists of artificial fill in Lynn and portions of the Revere side of the project site. This fill consists of earth and manmade materials that have been artificially placed. In addition, beach and dune deposits are present in the Point of Pines area in Revere. These deposits are primarily composed of sand and fine gravel deposited along the shoreline by waves, currents, and wind action. Beach sand deposits are composed of moderately sorted, very coarse to fine sand, and are commonly laminated. Coarser layers may contain fine gravel particles, while finer layers may contain very fine sand and silt. 4.1.1 Site Surveys An aerial survey was performed using aerial photography by Blue-Sky Geospatial Ltd., formerly Col-East. Bluesky utilized standard aerial photography methods to prepare topographic mapping at a scale of 1-inch equals 20 feet with 1-foot contour intervals. Single beam bathymetric, sub-bottom sonar and side scan sonar surveys were performed December 14-16, 2020. The surveys were intended to map current bathymetry (bed elevations), characterize sediment stratigraphy (overburden thickness), and identify surficial bed features which might hinder other aspects of site investigations. The extent of these operations was limited to the two alternate HDD alignments (Route 3 and Route 7) under consideration at the time. Figure 2 is a bathymetric map depicting site conditions using 1.0-foot NAD83 contours. A geophysical investigation along the land portions of the HDD alignments was conducted between late December 2020 and January 2021 by Hager GeoScience, Inc. (HGI). The purpose of this investigation was to locate potential obstructions, defined by AECOM as dense sands, fine or coarse gravels, cobbles, and boulders, to a depth of 50 feet. Because of the brackish tidal environment of the survey locations, HGI selected low-frequency ground penetrating radar (LFGPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) as the methods most likely to be able to resolve obstructions and map soil strata to the depth specified, with work to be performed during the low tide window to maximize depth penetration. The survey produced GPR and ERT figures that illustrate concentrations of gravel and individual cobbles and/or boulders observed along the proposed routes. On the Lynn side, the 6GPR data illustrates a two-tier stratigraphy below the reported clay layer starting at approximately 50 feet deep (Elevation ~40 feet). A few large objects are noted in the till. A U- shaped depression was noted as a former channel. This interval may represent a drainage system along which till was washed and fines were removed, leaving behind a concentration of coarse material. On the Revere side, GPR data show scattered individual objects within the clay layer and the beginning of concentrations of coarse material in the northern end of the profile, suggesting continuation into the channel. A portion of the route GPR traverse was obstructed by wooden docks owned by the Yacht Club, resulting in a 65-foot gap in coverage. 7Figure 2. Bathymetric contours and surface (December, 2020). 84.1.2 Geophysical Borings To better inform the project design with information relative to soil properties and groundwater levels, an extensive environmental soil exploration was undertaken between October 2020 and January 2021. This program included twelve landside test borings with eight monitoring well installations. All test borings and monitoring well installations were conducted in the Cities of Lynn, MA (20B-9, and 20B-10MW through 20B-13MW) and Revere, MA (20B-1, 20B-5, 20B- 14MW through 20B-17MW, and 20B-18) as noted on Figure 3Error! Reference source not found.. In general, the land side of the project site is underlain by very loose to medium-dense sand fill, which can extend to depths up to 18 feet. The existing fill is underlain by either a natural sand or a slightly organic silt, which overlies stiff to soft clay. The clay layer can extend to a depth of up to 94 feet below the existing ground surface and is underlain by glacial till. The subsurface conditions in the Saugus River generally consist of 3 to 20 feet of silty sand with few organics, overlying a stiff to very soft clay or clayey sand deposit that can extend to 69 feet below the mudline, with boulders encountered near the center of the Saugus River and the Lynn coast. The clay and/or clayey sand deposit is generally underlain by silty sand and gravel overlying glacial till and Argillite bedrock. 9Figure 3. Geophysical Borings and Test Pit Locations Overview Plan. 10Since the project site spans a large geographical area, the subsurface conditions for the two land side areas in Lynn and Revere and the HDD route across the Saugus River are summarized separately in the sections presented below. 4.1.2.1 Hanson Street, Lynn Borings performed along Hanson Street in Lynn are identified as 20B-9, 20B-10MW, 20B- 11MW, 20B- 12MW, and 20B-13MW. The following strata were encountered: • Fill - Loose to occasionally medium-dense granular fill was encountered at the ground surface of each boring, which extended to depths between 8 and 13 feet (EL. 8.3 and EL. 3.2). • Organic Silt - The fill was underlain by a very soft to stiff, slightly organic silt deposit, which extended to depths between 11 and 16 feet (EL. 8.6 and EL. 0.7). • Glaciofluvial Granular Deposit – The organic silt deposit was underlain by a medium-dense glaciofluvial granular deposit, which ranged from 9 to at least 17 feet in thickness and extended to depths between 20 and 26 feet (EL.-3.7 and EL. -8.3). • Silt - A 4-foot-thick layer of stiff silt was observed to underlie the glaciofluvial deposit in boring 20B-9, extending to a depth of 29 feet (EL. -12.3). • Marine Clay - The silt deposit encountered in boring 20B-9 and the glaciofluvial deposit in the other borings were underlain by a very soft to stiff marine clay deposit. The medium stiff and stiff clay was generally observed directly beneath the glaciofluvial or silt deposits, transitioning to a softer clay with depth. In boring 20B-9, the marine clay deposit was observed to extend to a depth of 55 feet, corresponding to EL. -39. • Glacial Till - Dense to very dense glacial till was encountered beneath the marine clay. No bedrock was encountered within this set of borings. • The groundwater depth in the borings at the time of drilling ranged between 5.0 and 9.0 feet below the ground surface. Based on several readings taken at the monitoring wells after borehole completion, the depth to groundwater has been observed to vary between 5.0 and 7.0 feet from the ground surface and is tidally influenced. 4.1.2.2 Rice Avenue, Revere Borings performed along Rice Avenue, in order from east to west, in Revere are identified as 20B-1, 20B- 14MW, 20B-15MW, 20B-18, 20B-5, 20B-16MW, and 20B-17MW: • Fill - Medium dense granular fill was encountered at the ground surface of each boring, which extended to depths between 8 and at least 17.5 feet (EL. 8.9 and EL. -1.4). • Glaciofluvial Deposit - The fill was underlain by a loose to medium-dense glaciofluvial deposit consisting mainly of sand, which ranged from 11.5 to at least 17 feet in thickness and extended to depths between 24 and at least 29 feet (EL. -8.8 and EL. -12.9). • Marine Clay - The glaciofluvial deposit was underlain by very soft to very stiff marine clay. The stiff clay was generally observed directly beneath the glaciofluvial deposit, transitioning to a softer clay with depth. • Glacial Till - The marine clay deposit extended to depths between 94 and 98.5 feet (EL. - 80.6 and EL. -82.4). Dense glacial till was encountered below the marine clay deposit. No bedrock was encountered within this set of borings. • The groundwater depth in the borings at the time of drilling ranged between 4.0 and 9.0 feet below the ground surface. Based on several readings taken at the monitoring wells after 11borehole completion, the depth to groundwater has been observed to vary between 4.0 and 9.0 feet from the ground surface and is tidally influenced. 4.1.2.3 Saugus River HDD Route (Route 7) Borings performed along Saugus River Route 7 are identified as 20B-5, 20B-6, 20B-7, 20B-8, 20B-19, 20B- 21, 20B-21A, and 20B-9: • River Sediment - Soft river sediment was encountered at the mudline of every boring. The sediment was comprised of sand and silt and extended to depths between 5 and 7 feet (EL. -5.2 and EL. -16.6). Glaciofluvial Deposit - The river sediment was underlain by a medium-dense glaciofluvial deposit of interbedded sand and clay, which extended to a depth of 7 feet below the mudline (EL. -7.0). • Marine Clay Deposit- The glaciofluvial deposit was underlain by a very soft to stiff marine clay deposit, with the stiff clay located near the top of the deposit transitioning to a softer clay with depth. This deposit extended to depths between 20 and 30 feet below the mudline (EL. -18.8 and EL. -40.0). • Gravel Deposit - The marine clay deposit was underlain by an 11.5-foot-thick deposit of very dense gravel encountered in boring 20B-21 at a depth of 23.5 feet, corresponding to EL. - 21.7. • Glaciofluvial Deposit - The gravel was underlain by a very loose to medium-dense glaciofluvial deposit, mainly consisting of sand, gravel, and clay. This deposit extended to depths between 45 and 70 feet below the mudline (EL. -45.0 and EL. -81.6). • Glacial Till - The glaciofluvial deposit was underlain by medium-dense to very dense glacial till, which extended to depths between 75 and 95 feet (EL. -74.0 and EL. -95.0). • Argillite Bedrock - Fresh, very hard Argillite (bedrock) underlaid the glacial till. The top of bedrock was encountered between elevations EL. -74.0 and EL. -95.0. 4.1.3 Sediment Quality An environmental soil sampling program was conducted in conjunction with the geotechnical exploration with the purpose of obtaining representative characterization data to assist with soil and groundwater management planning and obtaining necessary permits and approvals for off- site soil disposal facilities and regulatory agencies overseeing groundwater treatment and/or discharge. No soil above the Massachusetts Contingency Plan reportable conditions were found. The results of the soil sampling and analyses can be found in Attachment F and are discussed generally herein. All landside test borings and groundwater monitoring wells were completed with truck-mounted drill rigs operated by GeoLogic-Earth Exploration, Inc. of Norfolk, MA. The test borings were advanced using flush-jointed casing with drive and wash drilling techniques using a 4-inch drag bit. Drilling operations were conducted in conformance with ASTM standards where prudent. A driven standard split spoon (SPT) sampler was advanced to recover samples of soils. Continuous samples were collected using 2-foot split spoon samplers. The result of the soil sampling and analyses (26 samples, 2 per soil boring plus two duplicates) as pertaining to environmental standards are summarized below: • In general, PID screening results of soil sample headspaces were non-detectable or within background levels (below two parts per million per volume [ppmv]). There were low readings of 16 ppmv at 20B-10, and 4.4 ppmv and 2.1 ppm at 20B-18. 12• Very low or non-detectable levels of extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were detected in various samples, with all levels well below RCS-1 standards. No volatile petroleum hydrocarbon (VPH) levels were detected in the samples. • Various levels of total metals were detected in the samples, with all levels except one, below RCS-1 standards. Lead was detected in the 20B-14MW duplicate sample (3 – 5 ft bgs) at 350 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and at 170 mg/kg in the other sample from the same interval. The arithmetic average of the two samples is 260 mg/kg, which is above the RCS-1 lead standard of 200 mg/kg. This sample location, along Rice Avenue in Revere, is within an RCS-1 area because of residential homes within 500 ft (310 CMR 40.0361). The PLM analyses of the sample from 20B-14MW (3 – 5 ft bgs) indicated the following material detected: Coal (moderate), Coal Ash (moderate), Wood Ash (light), and Asphalt (trace). Per MassDEP, a background concentration for lead in soil containing coal ash or wood ash associated with fill material is 600 mg/kg (Table 1 of MassDEP’s Background Levels of PAHs and Metals in Soil Technical Update May 2002), and lead levels below this can be attributable to fill containing coal ash or wood ash and is exempt from reporting to MassDEP. • TCLP–lead analyses were completed on three samples, and the results are 0.83 milligrams per liter (mg/l) (20B-14MW, 3 – 5 ft bgs) to 1.8 mg/l (20B-15MW, 3 – 5 ft bgs), indicating non-hazardous. • No levels of PCBs, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and reactive cyanide and sulfide were detected in the 26 samples. • Very low or non-detectable levels of semi-VOCs or polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) contained with the EPH analyses were detected in various samples. Except for one compound, all levels are below RCS-1 standards. The PAH acenaphthene was detected at a level of 5.3 in the 10 – 12 ft bgs sample from 20B- 12MW (Lynn), which is slightly greater than the RCS-1 standard of 4 mg/kg, but below the RCS-2 standard of 3,00 mg/kg. The sample location is in a RCS-2 area based upon the S-2 definition in the MCP (310 CMR 40.0361), and therefore does not constitute a reportable condition. • Although there were no reportable conditions above the Massachusetts Contingency Plan, a small portion of the project area is currently regulated under the MCP. The site in question is a closed National Grid MCP disposal site on Riley Way Extension (Release Tracking Number [RTN] 3-0032437). The Conceptual Site Model for the closed National Grid site states the following about soil impacts: “The results of the investigation activities indicate that PAHs and metals are present in soil, and are likely related to a combination of fill material (including remnants of the timber bulkhead and asphalt pavement for Riley Way Extension), the former landfill, and the history of industrial activities in the immediate vicinity of the site; there are other no apparent sources for these compounds.” As of 2014, the status of the site is “Permanent Solution with No Conditions.” The only work proposed in that area of the site would be the pipe string laydown area, which would not entail ground disturbance. 134.2. Wetland Resource Areas An off-site wetlands investigation included the consultation of various sources regarding the topography, wetlands, and floodplains in and around the proposed project area. Off-site resources consulted included the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic map, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Hazard Layer, the MassDEP wetlands and hydrologic connection MassGIS data overlay, National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) MassGIS overlay, and the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) Program MassGIS layer. An AECOM wetland scientist (PWS) conducted onsite resource area delineations to identify regulated resource areas present, and the top of Coastal Beach in both Revere and Lynn in particular. These delineations were performed on May 14, 2020 and were in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (Technical Report Y-87-1; ACOE 1987) and Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Northcentral and Northeast Region (USACE 2012), the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (WPA) regulations (310 CMR 10.00), and MassDEP’s publication entitled “Applying the Massachusetts Coastal Wetlands Regulations” published August 2017. Per this manual, a subsequent desktop delineation was performed to identify the top of Coastal Bank in Lynn. Wetland resource areas protected under the Massachusetts Wetland Protection Act (MA WPA) and implementing regulations (301 CMR 10.00) that are present at the site include Coastal Beach, Coastal Dune/Barrier Beach Complex, Coastal Bank, 200-foot Riverfront Area, and Bordering Land Subject to Flooding (which coincides with the FEMA designated 100-year Floodplain). In addition, the 100-foot Buffer Zone to various resource areas is present. The boundary of these resource areas is illustrated in Figures 2A and 2B in Attachment B. The location of Coastal Bank in Lynn was determined using 1-foot site contours and according to the Coastal Manual. A field visit on March 10th, 2023, confirmed actual field conditions. For the purposes of the coastal bank delineation, the scope of analysis was within 100 feet of the project area. The CZM Coastal Manual indicates that the “coastal bank begins at the toe of the coastal bank slope, whether other coastal wetland resources end….The landward edge (or top) of the coastal bank is generally the top of, or the first major break in, the face of the coastal bank”. The lower boundary of Coastal Bank was defined as the upper boundary of Coastal Beach, as flagged in the field. Top of Coastal Bank is determined by the following scenario (Scenario D) from the Coastal Manual: “A ‘top of coastal bank’ will fall below the 100-year flood elevation and is the point where the slope ceases to be ≥10:1.”. This DEP Bank Policy figure illustrating Scenario D is shown in Figure 4 and was selected as the most applicable scenario to the site conditions because Coastal Bank confines Land Under the Ocean at the site, but Land Subject to Coastal Zone Flowage extends well inland and is not confined by Coastal Bank. 14Figure 4. Scenario D from the Coastal Manual. No Bordering Vegetated Wetland (BVW) is present within the limits of work (as indicated by the MassDEP Wetland data layer and confirmed during on-site wetland delineation). Bordering Land Subject to Flooding (BLSF) is present at nearly the entire project site. BLSF boundaries are illustrated in Figure 2A in Attachment B. No aquatic vegetation was seen around the base of the timber piles during a site visit in March 2023. 4.3. Fisheries and Wildlife No fisheries data are available for the Saugus River, and no evidence suggests any commercial fisheries are located near the project site. However, the Saugus River is mapped by the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries as a diadromous fish migratory habitat for the following species: alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), white perch (Morone americana), and Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod). Anecdotal evidence suggests that striped bass (Morone saxatilis), winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) may be present in the area (Fishbrain.com, April 2023). The Saugus River is mapped as a diadromous fish migratory habitat by the National Marine Fisheries Services for the species listed in Section 4.3. (above). Additionally, NOAA Fisheries maps this area as Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for species including Atlantic surfclam (Spisula solidissima), Bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis), Little Skate (Leucoraja erinacea), Atlantic Mackerel (Scomber scombrus), Yellowtail flounder (Pleuronectes ferruginea), among others. The area is also mapped as Highly Migratory Species EFH for Bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias). 15Recreational fishing occurs adjacent to the project site on both sides of the river. The Revere side of the river crossing is used as a yacht club and boat dock. A fishing pier is located at the mouth of the Saugus River in Lynn. The pier was closed from public access in the past several years for repairs, and it remains unclear whether it is open to the public at this time. Wildlife that may be present in the area includes ubiquitous species present in the North Coast watershed, including the gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and New England cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus transitionalis). The area provides appropriate habitat for many types of common bird species as well. 4.4. Threatened and Endangered Species Based on a review of the most recent Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) mapping, the project area overlaps with Priority Habitat of the Piping Plover, (Charadrius melodus) on the beach in Revere. Based on information available on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) website, there are no land-based endangered species or critical habitats known to occur in the project area. A threatened species, the Northern Long-eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis), has the potential to occur throughout Massachusetts, including the project area. However, there are no known maternity roost trees in the region, and the nearest known winter hibernacula is more than 8 miles from the project site. Thus, neither preparation of a Biological Assessment nor further consultation with USFWS under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is required. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) website was reviewed for Section 7 threatened and endangered species. It was determined that there were no critical habitats in the project area for the species listed. The species listed on the NMFS website are: large whales, sea turtles, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Gulf of Maine, Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus), and shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum). 4.5. Historic Structures or Districts and Archaeological Sites A terrestrial and underwater assessment of the entire study area's archaeological sensitivity was conducted before the geotechnical investigation in 2021. This included the review of historical boring logs and bathymetric data collected for the project. Archaeological monitoring and recordation of the geotechnical borings and test pits provided information regarding subsurface conditions and preservation potential for archaeological resources. No archaeological resources have been previously identified within the project area. Consultations with the Massachusetts Board of Underwater Archaeological Resources (BUAR) and the Massachusetts Historical Commission (MHC) occurred prior to the field program. Following the field program, the report was sent to BUAR, who then provided confirmation of their concurrence with the reported results and conclusions. Documentation of this consultation can be found in Attachment E. Certain terrestrial borings indicated the potential for archaeological resources. Archaeological monitoring of trench excavation will be performed, for which an amended State Archaeologist Permit will be obtained in coordination with MHC. If archaeological resources are observed, work will halt and appropriate protocols will be followed. 16As for the marine potential for archaeological resources, background research did not identify any historical properties in or directly adjacent to the HDD corridors. In addition, both geophysical surveys did not record potential previously sub-aerially exposed landforms. Geotechnical borings did record the presence of peat fragments in two cores but it was determined that they were not in situ and likely originated from eroded peat beds outside of the project area. Engineering studies of the sediments in the HDD indicate a very low potential for frac-outs occurring during the water main installation that would migrate up the organic-rich strata or to the surface. Based on these results, no further marine archaeological investigations are recommended or required by BUAR (see communication in Attachment E). 4.6. Hydrology and Water Quality The Saugus River begins at Lake Quannapowitt in Wakefield and meanders south thirteen miles through eleven communities before emptying into the Broad Sound. Near its mouth, the river becomes the Rumney Marsh/Pine River Estuary. Tributaries include the Mill River in Wakefield, Shute Brook in Saugus, Strawberry Brook in Lynn, Town Line Brook in Revere, Malden, and Everett. The river drains a watershed of approximately forty-seven square miles, which includes several ponds, such as Breeds Pond (Lynn), Birch Pond (Lynn), Walden Pond (Lynn), Hawkes Pond (Lynn), Crystal Lake (Wakefield), and Spring Pond (Saugus). During the environmental groundwater sampling program, characteristic data was obtained to assist with groundwater management planning, obtaining necessary approvals or permits from regulatory agencies overseeing groundwater treatment/discharge, and completing any required plans for groundwater management. Groundwater sample analyses included the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Remediation General Permit (RGP) parameters list. During this investigation, dissolved lead was detected in a groundwater sample (20B-14MW) along a short stretch of Rice Avenue in Revere. The level detected is above Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) reportable concentration and constituted a 120-day reportable condition per the MCP (MWRA notified the property owner of the condition). The other results of groundwater sampling and analyses (9 samples in November 2020 and 3 samples in 2021) are summarized below. • Very low or non-detectable levels of EPH, VPH, VOCs and SVOCs, Oil and Grease (TPH) were detected in the samples, all below RCGW-2 standards. • There were non-detectable levels of PCBs in the samples. • In the 2020 samples, very low or non-detectable levels of total metals were detected in various samples, and except for two samples, all levels are below RCGW-2 standards. The total lead level of 17 micrograms per liter (ug/l) in the sample from 20B-14MW is slightly above the RCGW-2 standard of 10 ug/l. The total selenium level of 170 ug/l in the sample from 20B-15MW is above the RCGW-2 standard of 100 ug/l. The re-sampling in April 2021 indicated dissolved lead at 11 ug/l in the sample from 20B-14MW and dissolved selenium at 7.6 ug/l in the sample from 20B-15MW (below the RCGW-2 standard, which applies to dissolved levels, not total). The July 2021 dissolved lead result from the sample from 20B- 14MW was 110 ug/l. The lead condition constitutes a 120-day reportable condition per the MCP. AECOM notified MWRA via e-mail on April 14, 2021 of the April 2021 dissolved lead in groundwater reportable condition, and MWRA notified the property owners (Point of Pines Beach Association, Inc.) in a letter dated August 12, 2021. 17At the location of the proposed pipeline installation, the Saugus River has a Zone AE floodplain, as depicted in Figure 5 (and Figure 2A in Attachment B). The Base Flood Water Surface elevation (BFE) in Lynn is shown to be EL 14 feet NAVD88. In Revere, this elevation is EL 10 feet NAVD88. Figure 5. Excerpt from Flood Insurance Rate Map for Essex County (Lynn, Panel 529) and Suffolk County (Revere, Panel 29). The maps are not to scale with respect to one another. 184.7. Air Quality The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has set a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone, as well as other pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulate matter, and lead. The USEPA establishes primary and secondary standards. While primary standards focus on public health, secondary standards concern general public welfare, such as visibility. The state regulates air quality using USEPA’s standards (310 CMR 6.00). MassDEP maintains monitoring stations throughout the state that record the highest concentration of the mean concentration of regulated air pollutants. There are two MassDEP air monitoring stations within five miles of the project site: 390 Parkland Avenue in Lynn and 31 Willow Street in Chelsea. The Lynn station monitors particulate matter (PM ) concentrations, ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and volatile organic 2.5 compounds, among other meteorological data. The Chelsea station monitors PM 2.5 concentrations. Data from these stations indicate that in 2021 there were no exceedances above the NAAQS at either station for any of the measured parameters during 2021 (MassDEP, 2022). MassDEP also regulates volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the state’s air pollution regulations also qualitatively regulate odor, by stating that no person having control of any odor- generating operations shall permit emissions therefrom which cause or contribute to a condition of air pollution (310 CMR 7.09). There were no obvious odors noted during any of the site visits. 4.8. Noise Many federal agencies use the day-night sound level to describe noise and to predict community effects from long-term exposure to noise. In addition, this noise level classification system is used to determine the appropriateness of a given use of specific land (land use compatibility) relative to the average level of environmental noise experienced at the location. Noise levels ranging from 65-75 decibels are generally compatible with residential land use. On the Revere side of the project site, the nearest residence is 10 Rice Avenue. The open-cut trench for the terrestrial pipeline will be dug approximately thirty feet away from this residence’s front door. The current noise-producing activities at the Revere site include those affiliated with recreational boating and the traffic on North Shore Road. In Lynn, the nearest residence is half a mile from the project site. The current noise-producing activities at the Lynn staging area include construction activities affiliated with the Lynn Landfill Cap Repair, an ongoing project adjacent to the proposed HDD Staging Area/Entry. 4.9. Traffic and Transportation The impacted roadways due to construction are shown in Table 2 with roadway classification and jurisdiction indicated. Route 1A: Route 1A is a multi-lane roadway that runs in the North/South direction connecting Boston in the South to Northeastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine in the North. The area of construction for this project occurs at the intersection of Route 1A and Hanson Street in Lynn, MA. This intersection is in a commercially developed area with several businesses in the immediate vicinity. Business hours are generally 7 AM to 9 PM for businesses within 1,000 feet of the area of construction. There is no parking allowed on Route 1A. The lane configuration for each approach is as follows: • Route 1A Northbound: Three through lanes. 19• Hanson Street Westbound: One left turn lane and one right turn lane. • Route 1A Southbound: Three through lanes and one southbound left turn lane. Hanson Street (Lynn): Hanson Street is approximately forty-five feet wide with one lane of traffic in each direction and two-hour parking allowed on both sides. Hanson street is a local street that provides access to two business developments from Route 1A. Hanson Street provides no connections to other roadways and is terminated on one end. At the road terminus there is a gate blocking vehicle access. There is a sidewalk on both sides of the road. Pedestrians may continue beyond the gate and access the Lynn Community Path. Rice Ave (Revere): Rice Ave ranges between approximately eighteen feet wide to twenty-two feet wide with one lane of traffic in each direction. No parking is permitted on Rice Ave. Rice Ave is a local street in a dense residential neighborhood. There is a non-continuous sidewalk on the north side of the street. Several side streets intersect with Rice Ave. These side streets are all one-way southbound roadways. The intersection of Rice Ave, Whitin Ave, and Lynnway: Lynnway is a one-way street that provides access to Rice Ave and Whitin Ave from Route 1A. Whitin Ave is a one-way street in the southbound direction. Rice Ave is a two-direction street. Vehicles entering the intersection from Rice Ave must make a left turn onto Whitin Ave. Table 2.

Aesthetic Resources/Open Space/Recreational Resources The area surrounding the proposed water pipeline installation in Revere is a residential neighborhood. The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation owns and maintains the Lynnway and North Shore Road and adjacent Right-of-Way, immediately west of the intersection between Rice Avenue and the Lynnway. This parcel of land is mapped as Article 97 Open Space on the MassGIS datalayer (MassMapper, 2023). Vegetation on the said parcel is limited to mixed herb-level grasses. See Attachment C for representative photographs of the project area). The area surrounding the proposed water pipeline installation in Lynn is primarily industrial and suspected to be entirely fill. The HDD staging area and pipe string layout are in an area restricted from public access due to an ongoing, adjacent landfill cap project. The capped landfill will be the site of a planned harbor park. As evidenced by footpaths in the vegetation and occasional trash in the vicinity of the timber pile removal site, the project site seemingly is used 20currently for passive recreation, such as walking and fishing. See Attachment C for representative photographs of the project area). 4.11. Socioeconomic Characteristics / Environmental Justice 4.11.1 Revere Socioeconomic Characteristics According to the 2017-2021 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (U.S. Census Bureau, Table DP05, ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates), the City of Revere has a population of 60,720. The racial composition of the population was 79.2 percent White, 7.0 percent Black or African American, 0.8 percent American Indian or Alaska Native, 5.7 percent Asian, 0.1 percent Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 21 percent some other race. In terms of ethnicity, 36.7 percent of the city was Hispanic or Latino. Also, according to the 2016-2020 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (Table DP05, Median Household Income in the Past 12 Months), the median household income in Revere was $64,331. The poverty rate in the city was 13 percent (Table S1701, Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months). 4.11.2 Lynn Socioeconomic Characteristics According to the 2017-2021 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (U.S. Census Bureau, Table DP05, ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates), the City of Lynn has a population of 100,233. The racial composition of the population was 58.4 percent White, 19.5 percent Black or African American, 2.0 percent American Indian or Alaska Native, 6.4 percent Asian, 0.7 percent Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and 26.4 percent some other race. In terms of ethnicity, 41.8 percent of the city was Hispanic or Latino. Also, according to the 2017-2021 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (Table DP05, Income in the Past 12 Months), the median household income in Lynn was $64,986. The poverty rate in the city was 13.6 percent (Table S1701, Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months). 4.11.3 Environmental Justice The project site is located within two block groups designated as environmental justice populations in Lynn and Revere. The Revere block group is designated an EJ community on the basis of minority and the Lynn block group on the basis of minority and income. There are 29 additional block groups designated as environmental justice populations either in whole or in part within the designated geographic area (i.e., within one mile of the project). Nine block groups are minority populations, six are minority and English isolation, three are minority and income, and eleven are minority, income, and English isolation. The EJ Screening Forms in Attachment I have maps of the populations in a one-mile radius color coded by EJ criteria. Table 3 provides a summary. The full list of Environmental Justice populations within five miles of the project site can be found in Attachment I. 21Table 3. Environmental Justice Communities within the Designated Geographic Area of the Proposed Project. Count Within the Project Area Minority 1 Minority and income 1 Within the Designated Geographic Area (1-mile) Minority 9 Minority and English isolation 6 Minority and income 3 Minority, income, and English isolation 11 Total (Project Area and DGA) 31 The Massachusetts Department of Public Health Environmental Justice Tool was consulted to determine whether Revere, Lynn, or Saugus (the three municipalities within one mile of the project site) exhibit any of the four priority community environmental justice criteria. As shown in Table 4, Revere meets two of the criteria (Childhood Asthma ED Visits and Hearth Attack Rate), and Lynn meets two of the criteria (Childhood Asthma ED Visits and Elevated Blood Lead Presence).

The state percentile indicates what percent of the Massachusetts population has an equal or lower value, meaning less potential for exposure, risk, or proximity. The two block groups in which project activities are proposed to occur are Block Group 1, Census Tract 1705.02, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, (Revere) and Block Group 1, Census Tract 2072, Essex County, Massachusetts (Lynn). Table 6 summarizes the rankings for these two census tracts. The data suggests these two clock groups generally have higher rankings than the State Average in the indicators listed. Table 6 indicates higher potential for exposure, risk, and proximity to environmental hazards. Notably, both block groups are within the 99th state percentile for 2017 Air Toxics Cancer Risk, 96th percentile for 2017 Air Toxics Respiratory Hazard Index, and both are above the 90th percentile for RMP Facility Proximity.

Source: Based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EJScreen (Version 2.0), accessed May 3, 2023. Attachment G provides the output report generated from the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool. Based on user-provided project information and the project location, the RMAT Tool output indicates “High Exposure” preliminary climate change exposure and risk ratings for sea level rise/storm surge, extreme precipitation – urban flooding, and extreme heat. This comprises a preliminary assessment of whether the project site and the proposed project infrastructure (assets) are exposed to impacts of natural hazard events and/or future impacts of climate change. The RMAT Project Report also notes that the proposed project is within mapped environmental justice populations. While the analysis indicates “High Exposure” to risks 26related to climate change, when the replacement pipeline is finished, the pipeline will be underground and underwater. This inherent aspect of the project design mitigates risk to the infrastructure. The project will also ensure water system redundancy and increased resiliency to the impacts of climate change. 5. Impacts of Proposed Project 5.1. Topography, Soils, and Sediment In Lynn, a portion of the shoreline would be impacted during construction, which may cause the potential for short-term soil erosion and the need for minor regrading. Pre-construction activities to mitigate this potential would include the installation of erosion and sedimentation controls, as shown on Sheets C-1 and C-2 and the HDD-7 Entry Point Major Equipment Layout figure in Attachment D. The HDD Staging Area and Entry site would also need to be cleared and grubbed, which would result in surface-level soil disturbance. No soil erosion is anticipated in Revere, as both the HDD Staging and Exit site and the Hanson Street limit of work are within paved areas. The sediment dredged by the HDD drill bit to accommodate the pipeline is approximately 94,000 cubic yards. Dredged sediment will be separated onsite by a series of sieves and cyclones into soil and sand. These materials will then be trucked offsite for disposal. The material is expected to be suitable for use as daily cover at a nearby landfill and this will be confirmed by sampling once the material is stockpiled as it is generated. It is not expected that contamination will be detected due to the depths of the sediments and distance from surface impacts. In addition to the dredging related to the HDD installation, the removal of the twelve timber piles is also considered dredging. The volume of material being removed (i.e., the volume of the piles under the mudline) is 50 cubic yards. The dilapidated timber piles will be cut into pieces (to discourage their reuse) and disposed of off-site. Their deteriorated quality and the presence of creosote make the piles unsuitable for reuse on-site or otherwise. 5.2. Wetland Resource Areas The proposed project would result in temporary impacts to a variety of wetland resource areas present at the site that are protected under the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (MA WPA) and implementing regulations (310 CMR 10.00), including Coastal Dune/Barrier Beach System, Coastal Bank, Coastal Beach/Tidal Flats, 200-foot Riverfront Area, Bordering Land Subject to Flooding, and the 100-foot Buffer Zone. Table 7 summarizes the proposed impacts to these resource areas. Activities resulting in these impacts are further described below in sections organized according to which resource area is affected. As there will be impacts to resource areas on both sides of the Saugus River in two different municipalities (which will be mitigated to the extent practicable), the leftmost column in Table 7 indicates whether the resource area being impacted is in Lynn or Revere. The only permanent impacts associated with the project are the installation of six manholes (three in Lynn and three in Revere) and filling the voids left from the timber pile removal. These manholes will be installed within Rice Avenue, Hanson Street (both of which are areas that are already paved). 27Table 7.

Revere Street pipeline installation via trench, HDD Staging and Entry Area, timber pile removal site and access route, and pipe string layout area). *All areas are approximate; sqft = square feet. 5.2.1 Coastal Dune/Barrier Beach System Impacts on the Barrier Beach System (only present on the Revere side of the project) are entirely temporary and overlap with the 200-foot Riverfront Area. They include the parking lot used as the HDD Staging/Exit Area and the Rice Avenue limit of work (LOW). No work will take place within the undeveloped, sandy beachfront. All work in the Barrier Beach System will be limited to paved areas (and the grassy shoulder at the western end of Rice Avenue). 5.2.2 200-foot Riverfront Area The Rice Avenue pipeline installation and the HDD Staging/Exit Area are located partially within the 200-foot Riverfront Area. As previously discussed, this terrestrial section of the pipeline will be installed via traditional cut-and-cover methods in a trench approximately seven feet wide within existing paved areas (the Point of Pines Yacht Club Parking Lot), roadway, and grassy shoulder at the western end of Rice Avenue. As the project limit of work (LOW) within the 200- oot Riverfront Area is entirely developed and paved, no clearing will be necessary. Sedimentation controls in the form of coir wattles will be installed along the perimeter of work, as shown in the attached project plans. 5.2.3 Coastal Bank A 950-square-foot section of Coastal Bank will need to be regraded in either timber pile removal scenario to facilitate equipment access to the pile removal site. The extent of the Bank that will need to be regraded has been reduced to the extent practicable and routed to avoid a large tree that appears to provide support to the bank. The regrading will include the temporary placement of geotextile reinforcement and riprap to make the slope less steep. Both the geotextile reinforcement and the riprap will be removed following construction, and the bank will be returned to preexisting conditions. These layers of protection will help prevent erosion to the bank structure and maintain its existing slope to the extent practicable. Vegetation on the coastal bank in the path that will need regrading will be cleared. Stumps of the trees and shrubs being removed will be ground to grade so that the support the roots provide to the Coastal Bank 28will remain intact. During construction, riprap would prevent sediment transport. This riprap will be removed following construction. In the long term, there will be no adverse effect on the movement of sediment from the bank. 5.2.4 Coastal Beach/Tidal Flats Work within Coastal Beach, including tidal flats, is limited to the extraction and subsequent fill of twelve timber piles from the dilapidated sea wall along the shoreline in Lynn. The area of Coastal Beach/Tidal Flat temporarily impacted by this work is 1,800 square feet. This pile removal will have no adverse effect by increasing erosion, decreasing the volume, or changing the form of the Coastal Beach or Tidal Flat. The existing dilapidated seawall provides no significant structure to the sediments or the form of the beach, and the partial removal thereof presents no adverse impact. The removal of the timber piles will not have any adverse effect on any specified habitat sites or rare vertebrate or invertebrate species. The pile removal itself will impact approximately 40 square feet and necessitate 50 cubic yards of low-density grout to be pumped into these voids. The timber piles will be excavated either by land or by barge. In either scenario, the voids left from the pile removal would be backfilled with grouting immediately following the removal. Grouting will be pumped through a tube into the hollow pipe from a pump truck. The pump truck would remain upslope of the Mean High Water line. The land removal scenario would require the piles to be removed on the upslope side of the existing Lynn timber bulkhead at low tide along the horizontal directional drilling route. The piles will be excavated at low tide and backfilled before the high tide returns during one tidal cycle. Geotextile will be placed where equipment will need to traverse the Coastal Beach to facilitate access and protect the bank from erosion. The removal by barge scenario would entail a spud barge with a large crane at a seaward position adjacent to the piles. The barge would be anchored in place by H-piles on each of the four corners, each with a surface area of 30 square inches for a total area of impact to Tidal Flats of less than one square foot. These spuds would be placed temporarily and are not anticipated to permanently alter Coastal Beach/Tidal Flats. If the work requires more than one tidal cycle, the barge will be removed from the shore to a depth that would prevent the barge from grounding. Upon the return of the high tide, the barge would be floated back in place to complete the pile extraction. 5.2.5 100-foot Buffer Zone Work within the 100-foot Buffer Zone of the Coastal Bank and Coastal Beach includes a portion of the HDD staging area (including the drill entry point), the access route to the timber bulkhead, a portion of the terrestrial pipeline installation within Hanson Street, and the pipe string laydown area. The HDD Staging Area and entry site will need to be cleared and grubbed to accommodate construction equipment. This area is vegetated primarily with phragmites and mixed grasses. Some sections include larger trees and shrubs such as Eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), white ash (Fraxinus americana), staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina), crab apple (Malus spp.), flowering pear (Pyrus calleryana), Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica), and multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora). The area will be revegetated with comparable, native plant species following all construction activities. The access route to the timber piles will also need to be cleared but not grubbed and is primarily vegetated by mixed grasses and autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata). This area will also be revegetated with comparable native plantings. As previously discussed, Hanson Street is paved, and the terrestrial pipeline installation will not 29require any clearing of vegetation. Similarly, the pipe string laydown area follows Riley Way Extension and will not require any vegetation to be cleared. 5.3. Fisheries and Wildlife As noted on the USACE New England website, Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF) recommends time of year (TOY) work restrictions in the Saugus River for the following species: alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), white perch (Morone americana), Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod), winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), and shellfish. The generic recommended DMF TOY restriction for these species is that no work occurs between February 15 and November 10. Construction period work restrictions specific to the Section 56 crossing will require consultation with the USACE and may allow work outside of the generic DMF TOY window considering that the proposed construction by HDD is not anticipated to directly impact the water column or substrate of the Saugus River. The construction noise may influence the local fish and wildlife populations in the general area. This temporary impact is necessary to install this pipeline and restore system redundancy to the communities impacted. Short-term disruption to the area during construction is not anticipated to negatively impact fish or wildlife long-term. 5.4. Threatened and Endangered Species As previously stated, the project area overlaps with Priority Habitat for the Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus). The project proposes temporary impacts to 4,000 square feet of NHESP Priority Habitat to store Point of Pines Yacht Club’s floating docks in the boating off-season. The Point of Pines Yacht Club has been storing many of these floats on the beach for several seasons under an Order of Conditions from the Revere Conservation Commission. The rest of the floats are typically stored in the parking lot, which will be unavailable due to construction activities. The total floats that need to be stored on the beach have a footprint of 4,000 square feet. The floating docks will be stored on the beach between October 1st to April 1st to avoid the sensitive range of dates for the plovers (April 1st through August 31st). They will be stacked to minimize their cumulative footprint. No work of excavation will occur in NHESP area as work will not occur on the beach and, in Revere, be limited to existing paved areas (and the grassy shoulder at the western end of Rice Avenue). While the endangered Northern Long-eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis) has the potential to occur throughout Massachusetts, there are no known maternity roost trees in the region, and the nearest known winter hibernacula are more than 8 miles from the project site. Thus, no impacts on threatened or endangered species are anticipated. 5.5. Historic Structures or Districts and Archaeological Sites The terrestrial potential for archaeological resources referenced in Section 4.5 was investigated during the geotechnical boring program with oversight from MHC and BUAR. The archaeological investigation indicated that natural stratigraphy is present under modern fill deposits within portions of the proposed water main trench along Rice Avenue in Revere. The Massachusetts Historical Commission has required that an archaeologist be present to monitor the construction of the water main installation within the Rice Avenue portion of the project. Documentation of this is provided in Attachment E. A qualified archaeologist shall be present during construction to confirm that no archaeological deposits/sites are encountered during construction activities. If a site or archaeological deposit is encountered, then the construction 30crew will be required to stop work while the archaeologist assesses the deposit based on MHC guidelines. The 2021 Archaeology Report for the project, which BUAR confirmed agreement with, concluded that there was low potential for archaeological resources present along the HDD subterranean route as well as a low potential for surface frac-outs. Based on these results, no further marine archaeological investigations are recommended or required by BUAR, and no adverse impacts to marine archaeological resources are anticipated. Please see the communication with MHC and BUAR in Attachment E for further elaboration. 5.6. Hydrology and Water Quality As the new pipeline section will be entirely underground, there will be no impact to the hydrology or the water quality of the Saugus River caused by the pipe installation by HDD methods. The potential for inadvertent returns during drilling (“frac-out”) has been considered in developing the pipe string route). Frac-outs occur when drilling fluid is released to the ground surface during HDD installation, or there is mud loss. Due to this HDD installation being beneath a river, it is virtually impossible to immediately identify a frac-out. Engineering studies of the sediments in the HDD alignment indicate a very low potential for frac-outs occurring during the water main installation that would migrate up the organic-rich strata or to the surface. A temporary steel conductor casing is planned for the entry and exit sides of the drill, specifically to reduce risks of inadvertent returns at these locations. Additionally, a site-specific frac-out management plan will be developed to best prepare for the unlikely occurrence of a frac-out during HDD activities. While the pipe installation by HDD methods is not anticipated to have any impact on the hydrology of water quality at the site, removal of the twelve timber piles along the Lynn shoreline will necessitate access to the shoreline. Due to the presumed depth of the piles, the timber pile bulkhead presents obstructions to the HDD route and must be removed to prevent a disturbance to the HDD operation. The twelve timber piles along the Lynn shoreline that will be removed are located on Tidal Flats and are regularly inundated at the base. As previously discussed, the dilapidated bulkhead provides no significant flood protection nor modulation of tidal action along the Lynn shoreline. Due to the age of the piles, it can be assumed that the treatment process utilized was creosote. Creosote is no longer allowed by environmental law except in very special cases. This is because creosote leaches from the timber structure upon which it has been applied and contaminates the adjacent soil and water. The removal of these piles will cease the creosote contamination. A turbidity curtain and floating debris boom will be placed to contain any creosote splinters or debris as the piles are removed. Several local marine pile driving firms have been contacted concerning the extraction of marine timber piles and the probability that these 90-year-old piles will break during the process. The firms indicated that extracting 60- and 70-foot-long creosoted timber piles are normally not a problem. The firms indicated that the piles tend to break in the tidal zone or just below the mudline where they have been either damaged by the sea, marine borers, or where they have deteriorated due to oxygenation. It is unlikely any piles would break and cause a greater environmental impact on the water quality than indicated herein. 5.7. Air Quality The project may increase the short-term potential for the release of pollutants to ambient air from dust associated with pipeline installation activities, as well as short-term emission releases from construction vehicles at the site. Best construction practices would be employed to reduce 31the impacts to air quality. This may include watering down of the construction access road during especially windy and dry days and reducing the idling times of construction vehicles. Due to the number of vehicles and duration of activity required to perform the work being limited, emissions are not anticipated to cause an exceedance of national or state air quality standards in the vicinity of the project site. 5.8. Noise Temporarily, increased noise levels would occur during pipeline installation activities. Factors contributing to this noise would be construction equipment and construction vehicles at the site. To minimize noise impacts during construction, best management practices (BMPs) would be implemented, including the use of mufflers on construction equipment and vehicles. 5.9. Traffic and Transportation For each of the locations listed below, MWRA will coordinate with DCR and the communities regard traffic management plans. Intersection of Route 1A and Hanson Street (Lynn): Construction at this intersection will consist of the installation of a proposed water main across Route 1A. The water main will cross along the southern approach of the intersection and then continue down Hanson Street. proposed temporary traffic control setup will involve a sequence of single-lane closures to cross the intersection. Only a single lane will be closed at any given time in either direction to maintain traffic flow along Route 1A. Temporary traffic control setups will be in place during off-peak traffic hours (overnight). This will minimize the impact to travelers on Route 1A and impacts to access points for nearby businesses. Parking restrictions and detours will not be required for this area of work. Hanson Street (Lynn): Construction on Hanson Street will consist of the installation of a proposed water main located in the southern shoulder. The proposed temporary traffic control setup will involve a sequence of shoulder closures along the south side of Hanson Street. To maintain existing driveway access points for businesses on Hanson Street, only one driveway will be blocked at any given time. Existing pedestrian facilities will be maintained, and a fence will be provided on the edge of the sidewalk. Temporary traffic control setups will be in place during off-peak traffic hours (6 pm to 6 am). Parking restrictions and detours will not be required for this area of work. Rice Ave (Revere): Construction on Rice Ave will consist of the installation of a proposed water main located outside the roadway in the grass strip on the north side of Rice Avenue. There is approximately 250’ of proposed water main located within the roadway near the intersection of Rice Ave and Whitin Ave (northwest of the yacht club). The proposed temporary traffic control setup at the intersection of Whitin Ave and Rice Ave will involve narrowing the roadway and maintaining all existing traffic movements. Construction vehicles and equipment will be located off the roadway on the north side of Rice Ave to provide a minimum of one travel lane. The section of water main installation on Rice Ave between Whitin Ave and Fowler Ave will require a short section of alternating one-way traffic with a police officer to direct vehicles during construction hours. The roadway will be covered with steel plates at the end of each work shift so that no alternating one-way setup will be required during off-peak hours. No further traffic control setups are required. 325.10. Aesthetic Resources/Open Space/Recreational Resources During construction, there would be aesthetic impacts in the immediate vicinity of Rice Avenue, Hanson Street, the HDD Staging Areas, and the timber pile removal site. In the long term, the area would return to its current aesthetics. As identified in Section 4.9. DCR owns and maintains the verge between the Lynnway and North Shore Road, immediately west of the intersection between Rice Avenue and the Lynnway. MWRA is working with MassDCR to determine Article 97 applicability. In Lynn, the area that appears to be used for passive recreation will be restricted from public access during construction activities. Following activities, the area would return to its current aesthetics. 5.11. Socioeconomic Characteristics / Environmental Justice As discussed in Section 4.11.3, the Project Site is within two environmental justice populations, and the project’s DGA is either in whole or in part within twenty-nine additional environmental justice populations. The EJ Screening Forms in Attachment I have maps that show EJ block groups within the DGA and are color-coded by EJ criteria. The complete list of environmental justice block groups within five miles of the project site can also be found in Attachment I. The project site is within two environmental justice block groups, those being Block Group 1, Census Tract 2072 (Lynn) and Block Group 1, Census Tract 1705.02 (Revere). Because the proposed project would return to service the Section 56 water main, the primary long-term benefit to both EJ and non-EJ populations of this project would be water supply system redundancy and reliability. A reliable water supply system protects public health and environmental health. The project would also have beneficial short-term effects on the economy due to a temporary increase in construction-related jobs, increasing employment opportunities for the construction workforce, and increasing revenues of local businesses and government generated from construction activities and workers. However, any increase would be temporary, lasting only for the duration of the construction The following impacts may affect environmental justice populations as well as the wider public and will be mitigated to the maximum extent practicable: • Short-term impacts to traffic on Rice Avenue would impact residents on this street during the installation of the pipeline in the roadway. Increased activity in the vicinity of the project site, including the Point of Pines parking lot, would temporarily disrupt local traffic. • Short-term impacts to traffic on Hanson Street would impact traffic patterns in the commercial/industrial vicinity during the installation of the pipeline in the roadway. • Short-term impacts on air quality in the project area could result from the temporary operation of machinery associated with construction activities. Best management practices (BMPs) to control construction emissions would be implemented to minimize visible fugitive dust emissions at the property line. • Short-term impacts to noise levels in the project area would occur during construction, primarily from mechanical equipment used for construction activities. • Short-term impacts to the access to the Community Path of Lynn and a segment of a walking/biking trail that goes along the waterfront. This area would be restricted from public access due to its proximity to the project site. 33These impacts are not expected to disproportionately impact EJ populations. The project would result in the following benefits to environmental justice populations as well as the wider public: • MWRA's Section 56 Water Pipeline provides water to residents and businesses in the cities of Revere and Lynn. This project will ensure water system redundancy and reliability, which is crucial to protect both public health and environmental health. Replacement of this pipeline will ensure continued water supply for consumption, fire protection, and sanitation. The EJ populations served by this pipeline, as well as the wider community, will benefit from the security that this pipeline replacement will bring to the area's water supply. As discussed in Section 4.11.3, Attachment G provides the output generated from the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool. The RMAT Tool output indicates “High Exposure” preliminary climate change exposure and risk ratings for sea level rise/storm surge, extreme precipitation – urban flooding, and extreme heat, and notes that the proposed project is within a mapped environmental justice population. As previously discussed, once the construction is complete, the project will be underground. This inherent aspect of the project design mitigates risk to the infrastructure. The project will also ensure water system redundancy and increased resiliency to the impacts of climate change. 6. Cumulative Impacts Any planned large projects in the area of the Saugus River Crossing that would occur around the same time as the proposed pipeline installation have the potential to interact with the proposed project, and, as such, are evaluated here for potential cumulative impact. The following projects have been identified as large-scale projects that will be occurring in the area in the same timeframe as the proposed river crossing: • Lynn Landfill Cap Repair – The Lynn Landfill is a 22-acre site along the Lynn Harbor Shoreline (to the northeast of the proposed project site). The cap repair project seeks to ameliorate the landfill, which had been capped prior to Massachusetts enacting more stringent regulations. Coordination with this project includes citing the Lynn HDD Staging and Entry Area appropriately. • Lynn Harbor Park – Following the Lynn Landfill Cap Repair, the City of Lynn (in partnership with the Massachusetts EOEEA) will develop a harbor park on the same site. At this point in time, the project has documented site conditions, put forth a conceptual plan, and is now undergoing a stakeholder engagement process. It is anticipated that work on the harbor park will begin in the next two to three years. The Lynn Harbor Park will be situated to the northwest of the Saugus River Crossing staging area and Hanson Street pipeline installation, such that the projects’ impacts will not directly overlap with one another. Only the proposed pipe string layout area extends far north enough to potentially overlap with construction activities for the Harbor Park. Coordination between the two projects will be required. The pipe string layout area (and the majority of the project area) are in Land Subject to Coastal Storm Flowage (LSCSF, coincident with the FEMA 100-Year Floodplain). If these two projects end up occurring simultaneously, temporary impacts to this resource area may be increased. Additionally, construction traffic in the area could be heightened. • Lynn Harbor Property LLC – This is a proposed 550-unit residential development adjacent to the project area in Lynn on the site of the former Lynnway Mart. The project underwent 34MEPA review between 2019 and 2021. MWRA is aware of the project intends to be closely coordinating with the project proponent. 7. Mitigation Erosion and sedimentation controls would be employed, including installing coir wattles downslope limits of grading, to minimize the potential for offsite sedimentation and erosion. Details of typical controls are illustrated on Sheets C-1 and C-2 in Attachment D. In the event a barge will be used to extract the timber piles along the Lynn shoreline, bottoming out will be avoided by floating the barge further from the shoreline as low tide approaches. A turbidity curtain will be installed around the perimeter of the pile removal work. Temporary devices and structures to control erosion and sedimentation in and around the site would be properly maintained at all times and removed and properly disposed of as soon as the site is stabilized following activities to rectify impacts, but no later than November 1, three full growing seasons following the completion of site activities. Stockpiles of sediment will be surrounded by erosion controls. Any sediment collected by these devices would be removed and placed in an upland location in a manner that prevents erosion and transport to any waterway or wetland resource area. A frac-out plan will be prepared by the contractor and submitted to the local Conservation Commissions before construction activities commence. A traffic management plan will be prepared in consultation with DCR and the two communities to mitigate temporary traffic disruption. Waste materials, debris, and trash would be cleaned from the work site at the end of each day and placed in trash barrels and/or dumpsters which would be disposed of off-site. At no time during construction is the dumping of spoils material, waste, or other debris allowed into any wetland area or other unspecified location. Concrete debris from demolition would be removed from wetland resource areas and stockpiled in the upland staging area while awaiting proper disposal. General construction safety procedures would be followed to prevent accidents that could result in spills, releases, or other environmental damage. Activities such as fueling operations and hot work would be monitored and conducted away from sensitive resource areas when possible. As indicated above, mitigation for dust would include watering down the construction access road and vehicles, as needed, especially during especially windy and dry days, and reducing the idling times of construction vehicles. To minimize noise impacts during construction, best management practices (BMPs) would include mufflers on construction equipment and vehicles. 8. Required Permits MWRA will coordinate closely with the local communities throughout the duration of the project to keep surrounding residents, businesses, and community organizations apprised of information regarding the project. The following permits/approvals are anticipated to be needed to implement the proposed project: Local Permits • Order of Conditions from the Lynn Conservation Commission under the Massachusetts Wetland Protection Act and the City of Lynn General Wetland Protection By-Law (following submission of a Notice of Intent) 35• Order of Conditions from the Revere Conservation Commission under the Massachusetts Wetland Protection Act and City of Revere Code of Ordinances Chapter 16.04 (Wetlands Protection) (following submission of a Notice of Intent) • City of Lynn Highway Engineering Department Street Opening Permit • City of Revere Highway Engineering Department Street Opening Permit State Permits • Consistency Determination from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management • MassDEP Chapter 91 Waterways License • MassDEP Distribution Modifications for systems • MassDOT Permit to Access State Highway • Department of Conservation and Recreation Access Permit • Massachusetts Historical Commission Section 106 Review • Division of Fisheries and Wildlife Natural Heritage and Endangered Species • Massachusetts Water Resources Authority Section 8(m) permit • Amended or new Massachusetts State Archaeology Permit • Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) review thresholds require an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the alteration of 10 acres or more of any “other” wetlands (301 CMR 11.03(3)(1)(a) if a state Permit is required. As noted above, the proposed project would require multiple state permits. Although direct, permanent wetland impacts will not exceed 10 acres of alteration of any “other” wetlands, two MEPA thresholds are exceeded by this project. They are as follows: - 11.03(3)(b)(1)(e): “New fill or structure of Expansion of existing fill or structure, except a pile-supported structure in a velocity zone or regulatory floodway.” - 11.03(3)(b)(1)(a): this review threshold is met when a permit is required for the alteration of coastal dune, barrier beach or coastal bank. Because the project area is located within the Designated Geographic Area (DGA) around an Environmental Justice Population, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required per 301 CMR 11.06(7)(b).

Page 1 of 12Scoring Rationale - Project Exposure Score The purpose of the Exposure Score output is to provide a preliminary assessment of whether the overall project site and subsequent assets are exposed to impacts of natural hazard events and/or future impacts of climate change. For each climate parameter, the Tool will calculate one of the following exposure ratings: Not Exposed, Low Exposure, Moderate Exposure, or High Exposure. The rationale behind the exposure rating is provided below. Sea Level Rise/Storm Surge This project received a \"High Exposure\" because of the following: Located within the predicted mean high water shoreline by 2030 Exposed to the 1% annual coastal flood event as early as 2030 Historic coastal flooding at project site Extreme Precipitation - Urban Flooding This project received a \"High Exposure\" because of the following: Maximum annual daily rainfall exceeds 10 inches within the overall project's useful life No historic flooding at project site No increase to impervious area Existing impervious area of the project site is between 10% and 50% Extreme Precipitation - Riverine Flooding This project received a \"Not Exposed\" because of the following: No historic riverine flooding at project site The project is not within a mapped FEMA floodplain [outside of the Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM)] Project is more than 500ft from a waterbody Project is not likely susceptible to riverine erosion Extreme Heat This project received a \"High Exposure\" because of the following: 30+ days increase in days over 90 deg. F within project's useful life Less than 10% of the existing project site has canopy cover Located within 100 ft of existing water body No increase to the impervious area of the project site No tree removal Scoring Rationale - Asset Preliminary Climate Risk Rating A Preliminary Climate Risk Rating is determined for each infrastructure and building asset by considering the overall project Exposure Score and responses to Step 4 questions provided by the user in the Tool. Natural Resource assets do not receive a risk rating. The following factors are what influenced the risk ratings for each asset. Asset - Return to service of the Section 56 Water Main that supplies potable water to for the MWRA Northern High Service Zone. Primary asset criticality factors influencing risk ratings for this asset: Asset can be inaccessible/inoperable more than a week after natural hazard event without consequences Loss/inoperability of the asset would have regional impacts The infrastructure provides services to populations that reside within Environmental Justice neighborhoods or climate vulnerable populations. Inoperability of the asset would not be expected to result in injuries Inoperability may moderately impact other facilities, assets, or buildings, but is not expected to affect their ability to operate There are no hazardous materials in the asset Page 2 of 12Project Climate Resilience Design Standards Output Climate Resilience Design Standards and Guidance are recommended for each asset and climate parameter. The Design Standards for each climate parameter include the following: recommended planning horizon (target and/or intermediate), recommended return period (Sea Level Rise/Storm Surge and Precipitation) or percentile (Heat), and a list of applicable design criteria that are likely to be affected by climate change. Some design criteria have numerical values associated with the recommended return period and planning horizon, while others have tiered methodologies with step-by-step instructions on how to estimate design values given the other recommended design standards. Asset: Return to service of the Section 56 Water Main that supplies Infrastructure potable water to for the MWRA Northern High Service Zone. Sea Level Rise/Storm Surge High Risk Target Planning Horizon: 2070 Intermediate Planning Horizon: 2050 Return Period: 50-yr (2%) LIMITATIONS: The recommended Climate Resilience Design Standards for the Sea Level Rise / Storm Surge Design Criteria are based on the user drawn polygon and relationships as defined in the Supporting Documents. The projected values provided through the Tool are based on the Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM) outputs as of 9/13/2021, which included GIS-based data for three planning horizons (2030, 2050, 2070) and six return periods (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%). These values are projections based on assumptions as defined in the model and the LiDAR used at the time. For additional information on the MC-FRM, review the additional resources provided on the Start Here page. The projected values, Standards, and Guidance provided within this Tool may be used to inform plans and designs, but they do not provide guarantees for future conditions or resilience. The projected values are not to be considered final or appropriate for construction documents without supporting engineering analyses. The guidance provided within this Tool is intended to be general and users are encouraged to do their own due diligence.

The projected Total Precipitation Depth values provided through the Tool are based on the climate projections developed by Cornell University as part of EEA's Massachusetts Climate and Hydrologic Risk Project, GIS-based data as of 10/15/21. For additional information on the methodology of these precipitation outputs, see Supporting Documents. While Total Precipitation Depth & Peak Intensity for 24-hour Design Storms are useful to inform planning and design, it is recommended to also consider additional longer- and shorter-duration precipitation events and intensities in accordance with best practices. Longer-duration, lower-intensity storms allow time for infiltration and reduce the load on infrastructure over the duration of the storm. Shorter-duration, higher-intensity storms often have higher runoff volumes because the water does not have enough time to infiltrate infrastructure systems (e.g., catch basins) and may overflow or back up during such storms, resulting in flooding. In the Northeast, short-duration high intensity rain events are becoming more frequent, and there is often little early warning for these events, making it difficult to plan operationally. While the Tool does not provide recommended design standards for these scenarios, users should still consider both short- and long-duration precipitation events and how they may impact the asset. The projected values, standards, and guidance provided within this Tool may be used to inform plans and designs, but they do not provide guarantees for future conditions or resilience.

Location of Project: Lynn, Revere Estimated Capital Cost: $7,000,000 Who is the Submitting Entity? Private Other Massachusetts Water Resources Authority Peter Grasso (Peter.Grasso@MWRA.com) Is this project being submitted as part of a state grant application? No Which grant program? What stage are you in your project lifecycle? Permitting Is climate resiliency a core objective of this project? Yes Is this project being submitted as part of the state capital planning process? No Is this project being submitted as part of a regulatory review process or permitting? Yes Brief Project Description: MWRA is proposing the replacement of the portion of the Section 56 water main below the riverbed of the Saugus River between Lynn and Revere to restore water supply redundancy. This section previously crossed the river via General Edwards Bridge and was removed from the system in 2019 due to severe corrosion. The section installed via HDD would tie into the existing water main via sections of water main installed by traditional cut and cover methods along Hanson Street and Rice Avenue in Lynn and Revere, respectively. Project Submission Comments: The purpose of this project is a return to service of an existing water main. A portion that previously crossed the Saugus River via the General Edwards Bridge was removed in 2019. Since then, the water supply system of the MWRA Northern High Service Zone has had no redundancy and has been vulnerable to failure. Because the replacement must tie into the existing pipeline, relocation of this project is not possible. Additionally, the entire project will be underground, with the only surface impacts being six manholes with existing paved roadways. Considerations regarding climate exposure are not particularly relevant to this project.

Y/N/ unknown Estimated GHG emissions of conditioned spaces (click Not applicable. here for GHG Estimation tool) Project Description 1. Provide a brief project description, including overall size of the project site and square footage of proposed buildings and structures if known. The Massachusetts Water Resource Authority (MWRA) is proposing to replace a section of its existing Section 56 water pipeline. Section 56 provides water service to the cities of Lynn and Revere. The section of this water pipeline to be replaced was previously attached to the General Edwards Bridge over the Saugus River (which is also Lynn/Revere municipal border) but had to be removed in 2018 due to severe corrosion. MWRA now proposes to replace this section of water pipeline by installing a new section of water pipeline under the water of the Saugus River, using both open-cut and trenchless underwater pipeline construction methods. MWRA’s Section 56 Water Pipeline Replacement Project will ensure water system redundancy and reliability for residents and businesses in these communities, which is crucial to protecting public and environmental health. After the construction is complete, the only existing surface impacts will be approximately six manholes, which will be flush with the paved surfaces of Rice Avenue in Revere and Hanson Street in Lynn and/or in a grassy traffic island at the entrance to North Shore Road in Revere. Specific project activities include: • Installation of a 20-inch water main under the Saugus River using horizontal 1directional drilling (HDD) methods. • Installation of a 20-inch water main, including fittings, valves, air release valves, and blow-offs in Rice Avenue in Revere, from the Saugus River HDD crossing point at the Point of Pines Yacht Club to the existing Section 56 pipeline between the Route 1A northbound on-ramp and the Lynnway. • Installation of 20-inch diameter water main and appurtenances, including fittings, valves, air release valves, and blow-offs in Hanson Street in Lynn, from the existing Section 56 pipeline in Route 1A to the Saugus River HDD crossing point at the end of Hanson Street/Riley Way Extension • Installation of environmental controls and traffic management, replacement of utilities, surface restoration, road reconstruction/pavement restoration, and sidewalk reconstruction. • The removal of twelve timber piles from the deteriorated seawall on the Lynn shoreline. • Temporary staging/HDD entry/exit pits at the Point of Pines Yacht Club parking lot in Revere and at the end of Hanson Street/Riley Way Extension in Lynn. The total area of temporary disturbance is 2.9 acres. There are no proposed permanent above-ground buildings or structures. 2. List anticipated MEPA review thresholds (301 CMR 11.03) (if known) • 301 CMR 11.03(3)(b)(1)(e), which states: “New fill or structure or Expansion of existing fill or structure, except a pile-supported structure, in a velocity zone or regulatory floodway.” • 301 CMR 11.03(3)(b)(1)(a), regarding “alteration of coastal dune, barrier beach or coastal bank.” 3.

Identify EJ populations and characteristics (Minority, Income, English Isolation) within 5 miles of project site (can attach map identifying 5-mile radius from EJ Maps Viewer in lieu of narrative) Within 5 miles of the project site, there are EJ block groups with the following characteristics: Minority; Income; English isolation; Minority and income; Minority and English isolation; Income and English isolation; Minority, Income, and English isolation. The attached map shows the 5-mile radius from the EJ Maps Viewer. 25. Identify any municipality or census tract meeting the definition of “vulnerable health EJ criteria” in the DPH EJ Tool located in whole or in part within a 1-mile radius of the project site There are three municipalities in part within a 1-mile radius of the project site. These are Lynn, Revere, and Saugus. • Lynn meets two of the Vulnerable Health EJ Criteria: Lead Poisoning (29 BLL >= ug/dL Prevalence per 1,000) and Asthma ED Visits (130 per 10,000). For these two criteria, the rate or prevalence in Lynn is greater than 110% the rate or prevalence for the state as a whole. • Revere also meets two Criteria: Heart Attack (30%) and Asthma ED Visits (111 Visits per 10,000). For these two criteria, the rate or prevalence in Revere is greater than 110% the rate or prevalence for the state as a whole. • Saugus does not exceed any of the four Vulnerable Health EJ Criteria. For all four criteria, the rate or prevalence in Saugus is less than 110% the rate or prevalence for the state as a whole. 6. Identify potential short-term and long-term environmental and public health impacts that may affect EJ Populations and any anticipated mitigation The following impacts may affect EJ populations as well as the wider public: - Short-term impacts to traffic on Rice Avenue would impact residents on this street during the installation of pipeline in the roadway. Increased activity in the vicinity of the project site, including the Point of Pines parking lot, would temporarily disrupt local traffic. - Short-term impacts to traffic on Hanson Street would impact traffic patterns in the commercial/industrial vicinity during the installation of pipeline in the roadway. - Short-term impacts to air quality in the project area could result from the temporary operation of machinery associated with construction activities. Best management practices (BMPs) to control construction emissions would be implemented to minimize dust and emission. - Short-term impacts to noise levels in the project area would occur during construction, primarily from mechanical equipment used for construction activities. Noise impacts will be minimized to the extent feasible through measures including preventing unnecessary vehicle idling. - Short-term impacts to public access to the Community Path of Lynn and a segment of adjacent waterfront walking/biking trail during construction. These impacts are not expected to disproportionately impact EJ populations. 7. Identify project benefits, including “Environmental Benefits” as defined in 301 CMR 11.02, that may improve environmental conditions or public health of the EJ population The project would result in the following benefits to EJ populations as well as the wider public: - MWRA's Section 56 Water Pipeline provides water to residents and businesses in the cities of Revere and Lynn. This project will ensure water system redundancy and reliability, which is crucial to protecting public and environmental health. Replacement of this pipeline will ensure continued water supply for consumption, fire protection, and sanitation. The EJ populations served by this pipeline, as well as the wider community, will 3benefit from the security that this pipeline replacement will bring to the area's water supply. 8. Describe how the community can request a meeting to discuss the project, and how the community can request oral language interpretation services at the meeting. Specify how to request other accommodations, including meetings after business hours and at locations near public transportation.

Да/нет/ неизвестно Расчётные выбросы парниковых газов в кондиционируемых помещениях (щёлкните здесь, Не применимо. чтобы воспользоваться Инструментом оценки выбросов парниковых газов) Описание проекта 1. Предоставьте краткое описание проекта, включая общую площадь участка проекта и площадь в квадратных футах предполагаемых зданий и сооружений, если известно. Управление водных ресурсов штата Массачусетс (MWRA) предполагает заменить часть существующего водопровода на участке 56. Участок 56 обеспечивает водоснабжение городов Линн и Ревир. Участок водопровода, подлежащий замене, ранее был прикреплён к мосту генерала Эдвардса через реку Саугус (который также является муниципальной границей городов Линн/Ревир), но в 2018 году его пришлось демонтировать из-за сильной коррозии. MWRA теперь предполагает заменить эту часть водопровода путём прокладки нового участка водопровода под водами реки Саугус, используя как открытый, так и бестраншейный способ строительства подводных трубопроводов. «MWRA, участок 56, проект по замене водопроводных труб» обеспечит 1резервирование и надёжность водоснабжения для жителей и предприятий в этих населённых пунктах, что имеет решающее значение для защиты здоровья людей и окружающей среды. После завершения строительства единственным следом на поверхности останутся приблизительно шесть люков, которые будут располагаться вровень с асфальтированными поверхностями Райс Авеню в Ревире и Хэнсон Стрит в Линне, и (или) на травянистом островке безопасности на въезде на Норт Шор Роуд в Ревире. Конкретные мероприятия по проекту включают: • Прокладывание 20-дюймовых водопроводных труб под рекой Саугус с использованием методов горизонтально-направленного бурения (ГНБ). • Прокладывание 20-дюймовых водопроводных труб, включая соединительные детали, клапаны, выпускные воздушные клапаны и продувочные устройства, на Райс Авеню в Ревире, от места пересечения ГНБ реки Саугус у яхт-клуба «Пойнт оф Пайнс» до существующего участка 56 трубопровода между северным выездом на шоссе 1A и Линнуэй. • Прокладывание водопроводных труб диаметром 20 дюймов и вспомогательных элементов, включая соединительные детали, клапаны, выпускные воздушные клапаны и продувочные устройства, на Хэнсон Стрит в Линне, от существующего участка 56 трубопровода на шоссе 1A до места пересечения ГНБ реки Саугус в конце Хэнсон Стрит/Райли Уэй Экстеншн • Установка систем экологического контроля и управления движением, замена коммуникаций, восстановление поверхности, реконструкция дорог/восстановление дорожного покрытия и реконструкция тротуаров. • Демонтаж двенадцати деревянных свай из разрушенной набережной вдоль береговой линии Линна. • Временное размещение входа/выхода котлованов ГНБ на стоянке яхт- клуба «Пойнт оф Пайнс» в Ревире и в конце Хэнсон Стрит/Райли Уэй Экстеншн в Линне. Общая площадь территории с временными неудобствами для жителей составит 2,9 акров. Возведение постоянных надземных зданий или сооружений не предполагается. 2. Перечислите предполагаемые минимальные требования к рассмотрению в соответствии с MEPA (Кодекс нормативных актов штата Массачусетс (CMR), раздел 301, 11.03) (если известно) • CMR, раздел 301, 11.03(3)(b)(1)(e), который гласит: «Новая отсыпка, или сооружение, или расширение существующей отсыпки или сооружения, за исключением сооружений на свайных опорах, в скоростной зоне или нормативной полосе затопления». • CMR, раздел 301, 11.03(3)(b)(1)(a), касательно «изменения прибрежной дюны, барьерного пляжа или прибрежной насыпи». 3. Перечислите все предполагаемые разрешения штата, местные и федеральные разрешения, необходимые для проекта (если известно) Уведомление о намерениях MA WPA (ожидается постановление об условиях из Ревира и Линна) Сертификация качества воды 401 MassDEP Определение соответствия прибрежной зоны Mass CZM Разрешение 8M MWRA Разрешение на работы на улице, Ревир, MassDOT 2Разрешение на работы на улице, Линн, MassDOT Разрешение на доступ к строительству, MassDCR Форма уведомления о проекте (PNF) Исторической комиссии штата Массачусетс и соблюдение требований раздела 106 Закона о сохранении национальных исторических памятников Инженерный корпус армии США, разрешения согласно разделу 404 и 408 Глава 91, лицензия согласно Закону об общественных набережных штата Массачусетс 4. Определите группы населения с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости и их характеристики (меньшинство, доход, изолированность от английского языка) в пределах 5 миль от участка проекта (можно приложить карту с указанием радиуса в 5 миль из Просмотра карт экологической справедливости вместо описания) В пределах 5 миль от участка проекта существуют блоковые группы с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости со следующими характеристиками: Меньшинство; доход; изолированность от английского языка; меньшинство и доход; меньшинство и изолированность от английского языка; доход и изолированность от английского языка; меньшинство, доход и изолированность от английского языка. На прилагаемой карте показан 5-мильный радиус из Просмотра карт экологической справедливости. 5. Определите любой муниципалитет или район переписи населения, отвечающий определению «критериев экологической справедливости для уязвимого здоровья населения» при помощи Инструмента экологической справедливости Департамента общественного здоровья (DPH) , расположенный полностью или частично в радиусе 1 мили от участка проекта Существуют три муниципалитета, частично расположенные в радиусе 1 мили от участка проекта. Это Линн, Ревир и Саугус. • Линн соответствует двум критериям экологической справедливости для уязвимого здоровья населения: Отравление свинцом (уровень свинца в крови 29 >= мкг/дл, распространённость на 1000 человек) и посещения отделения неотложной помощи в связи с астмой (130 на 10 000 человек). По этим двум критериям уровень или распространённость в Линне более чем на 110% превышает уровень или распространённость в штате в целом. • Ревир также соответствует двум критериям: Сердечный приступ (30%) и посещения отделения неотложной помощи в связи с астмой (111 посещений на 10 000 человек). По этим двум критериям уровень или распространённость в Ревире более чем на 110% превышает уровень или распространённость в штате в целом. • В Саугусе не превышен ни один из четырёх критериев экологической справедливости для уязвимого здоровья населения. По всем четырём критериям уровень или распространённость в Саугусе меньше, чем 110% от уровня или распространённости в штате в целом. 6. Определите потенциальное краткосрочное и долгосрочное воздействие на окружающую среду и общественное здоровье, которое может затронуть население с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости, и любые предполагаемые меры по минимизации такого воздействия. Следующие виды воздействия могут затронуть население с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости, а также более широкую общественность: - Краткосрочное воздействие на движение транспорта по Райс Авеню затронет 3жителей этой улицы во время прокладки водопроводных труб на проезжей части. Повышенная активность вблизи участка проекта, включая стоянку у яхт-клуба «Пойнт оф Пайнс», может временно нарушить местное движение. - Краткосрочное воздействие на движение транспорта по Хэнсон Стрит повлияет на схему движения в близлежащем коммерческом/промышленном районе во время прокладки водопроводных труб на проезжей части. - Может иметь место краткосрочное воздействие на качество воздуха в районе выполнения проекта из-за временной работы техники в связи со строительными работами. Для контроля строительных выбросов будут применяться передовые методы управления (BMP), чтобы минимизировать пыль и выбросы. - Во время строительства будет иметь место краткосрочное воздействие на уровни шума в районе выполнения проекта, в основном от механического оборудования, используемого для строительных работ. Шумовое воздействие будет сведено к минимуму, насколько это возможно, при помощи конкретных мер, включая предотвращение ненужного простоя транспортных средств. - Краткосрочное воздействие на доступ населения к Общественной тропе Линна и участку прилегающей пешеходной/велосипедной дорожки на набережной во время строительства. Ожидается, что эти виды воздействия не окажут непропорционального влияния на население с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости. 7. Определите преимущества проекта, включая «Преимущества для окружающей среды», согласно определению, приведённому в CMR, раздел 301, 11.02, которые могут улучшить экологические условия или общественное здоровье населения с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости В результате проекта будут достигнуты следующие преимущества для населения с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости, а также для более широкой общественности: - «MWRA, участок 56, проект по замене водопроводных труб» предоставляет водоснабжение для жителей и предприятий в городах Ревир и Линн. Данный проект обеспечит резервирование и надёжность водоснабжения, что имеет решающее значение для защиты здоровья людей и окружающей среды. Замена водопроводных труб обеспечит непрерывное водоснабжение для личного потребления, противопожарной безопасности и улучшения санитарии. Население с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости, обслуживаемое этим водопроводом, а также сообщество в целом получат пользу от повышенной безопасности и надёжности, которую обеспечит замена трубопровода для водоснабжения района. 8. Укажите, как сообщество может запросить встречу для обсуждения этого проекта и как оно может запросить услуги устного перевода в ходе этой встречи. Укажите, как запросить другие удобства, включая встречи в нерабочее время и в местах, расположенных рядом с общественным транспортом.

Proporcione una breve descripción del proyecto, incluyendo el tamaño total del sitio del proyecto y las áreas en pies cuadrados de las estructuras y los edificios propuestos, si se conocen. Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), que es a autoridad de recursos hídricos de Massachusetts, propone sustituir una sección de su actual tubería de agua de la Sección 56. La Sección 56 suministra agua a las ciudades de Lynn y Revere. La sección de esta tubería de agua que se reemplazará estaba previamente unida al Puente General Edwards sobre el Río Saugus (que también es frontera municipal entre Lynn y Revere), pero tuvo que ser retirada en 2018 debido a una severa corrosión. MWRA ahora propone reemplazar esta sección de tubería de agua instalando una nueva sección de tubería de agua bajo el agua del Río Saugus, utilizando métodos de construcción de tuberías submarinas tanto a cielo abierto como sin zanjas. El proyecto de reemplazo de la tubería de agua de la Sección 56 de la MWRA asegurará la redundancia y confiabilidad del sistema de agua para los residentes y las empresas de estas comunidades, lo cual es crucial para proteger la salud pública y ambiental. Una vez finalizada la construcción, los únicos impactos superficiales existentes serán aproximadamente seis pozos de registro que quedarán al ras de las superficie pavimentada de Rice Avenue en Revere y Hanson Street en Lynn y/o en una isla de tráfico con césped a la entrada de North Shore Road en Revere. 1Entre las actividades específicas del proyecto se incluyen: • Instalación de una tubería principal de agua de 20 pulgadas (50 cm) bajo el Río Saugus utilizando métodos de Perforación Direccional Horizontal (HDD). • Instalación de una tubería principal de agua de 20 pulgadas (50 cm), incluyendo accesorios, válvulas, válvulas de purga de aire y purgadores en Rice Avenue en Revere, desde el punto de cruce de la HDD del Río Saugus en el club de yates Point of Pines hasta la tubería existente de la Sección 56 entre la rampa de acceso en dirección norte de la Route 1A y Lynnway. • Instalación de una tubería principal de agua de 20 pulgadas (50 cm) de diámetro y sus accesorios, incluyendo válvulas, válvulas de purga de aire y purgadores en Hanson Street en Lynn, desde la tubería existente de la Sección 56 en la Route 1A hasta el punto de cruce de la HDD del Río Saugus al final de Hanson Street/Riley Way Extension. • Instalación de controles ambientales y gestión del tráfico, reemplazo de servicios públicos, restauración de la superficie, reconstrucción del camino/restauración del pavimento y reconstrucción de las aceras. • Retirada de doce pilotes de madera del malecón deteriorado en la costa de Lynn. • Fosos temporales de entrada/salida de la HDD en el aparcamiento del club de yates Point of Pines en Revere y al final de Hanson Street/Riley Way Extension en Lynn. El área total de perturbación temporal es de 2.9 acres (1.17 hectáreas). No se proponen edificios ni estructuras permanentes sobre el suelo. 2. Enumere los umbrales de revisión previstos de la MEPA (301 CMR 11.03) (si se conocen) • 301 CMR 11.03(3)(b)(1)(e), que establece: \"Nuevo relleno o estructura o expansión de relleno o estructura existente, excepto una estructura soportada por pilotes, en una zona de velocidad o vía de inundación reglamentaria\". • 301 CMR 11.03(3)(b)(1)(a), relativa a la \"alteración de duna costera, playa de barrera o banco costero\". 3. Enumere todos los permisos estatales, locales y federales previstos necesarios para el proyecto (si se conocen) Notificación de Intención de la ley de protección de humedales MA WPA (Orden de condiciones previstas de Revere y Lynn) Certificación de Calidad del Agua MassDEP 401 Determinación de Consistencia de la Zona Costera de Mass CZM Permiso 8M de la MWRA Permiso de MassDOT para Apertura de Calle, Revere Permiso de MassDOT para Apertura de Calle, Lynn Permiso de MassDCR para Acceso a la Construcción Formulario de Notificación de Proyecto (PNF) de la comisión histórica Massachusetts Historical Commission y cumplimiento de la Sección 106 de la ley de preservación histórica National Historic Preservation Act Permisos de la Sección 404 y 408 del cuerpo de ingenieros militares US Army Corps of Engineers. Licencia del Capítulo 91 de la ley de malecones públicos Massachusetts Public Waterfront Act 24. Identifique las poblaciones y características de Justicia Ambiental (Environmental Justice (EJ)) (minorías, ingresos, aislamiento del inglés) en un radio de 5 millas (8 km) del lugar del proyecto (se puede adjuntar un mapa que identifique el radio de 5 millas (8 km) desde el visualizador de mapas EJ Maps Viewer en lugar de la descripción). Dentro de un radio de 5 millas (8 km) del sitio del proyecto, hay grupos de bloques de Justicia Ambiental (EJ) con las siguientes características: Minoría; Ingresos; Aislamiento del Inglés; Minoría e Ingresos; Minoría y Aislamiento del Inglés; Ingresos y Aislamiento del Inglés; Minoría, Ingresos y Aislamiento del Inglés. El mapa adjunto muestra el radio de 5 millas (8 km) del visualizador EJ Maps Viewer. 5. Identifique con la herramienta DPH EJ Tool cualquier municipio o tramo censal que cumpla con la definición de \"criterios de Justicia Ambiental de salud vulnerable\" y que esté ubicado total o parcialmente dentro de un radio de 1 milla (1.6 km) del sitio del proyecto. Hay tres municipios que están en parte dentro de un radio de 1 milla (1.6 km) del lugar del proyecto. Estos son Lynn, Revere y Saugus. • Lynn cumple con dos de los criterios de Justicia Ambiental de salud vulnerable: Envenenamiento por plomo (29 BLL >= ug/dL de Prevalencia por cada 1,000) y Visitas al Departamento de Urgencias (ED) por Asma (130 por cada 10,000). Para estos dos criterios, la tasa o prevalencia en Lynn es superior al 110% de la tasa o prevalencia en el estado en su conjunto. • Revere también cumple dos criterios: Ataque cardíaco (30%) y Visitas al Departamento de Urgencias por Asma (111 visitas por cada 10,000). Para estos dos criterios, la tasa o prevalencia en Revere es superior al 110% de la tasa o prevalencia para el estado en su conjunto. • Saugus no excede ninguno de los cuatro Criterios de Justicia Ambiental de Salud Vulnerable. Para los cuatro criterios, la tasa o prevalencia en Saugus es inferior al 110% de la tasa o prevalencia para el estado en su conjunto. 6. Identifique los posibles impactos ambientales y de salud pública a corto y largo plazo que puedan afectar a las poblaciones de Justicia Ambiental y cualquier mitigación anticipada Los siguientes impactos pueden afectar a las poblaciones de Justicia Ambiental así como al público en general: - Los impactos a corto plazo en el tráfico en Rice Avenue afectarían a los residentes de esta avenida durante la instalación de la tubería en el camino. El aumento de la actividad en las inmediaciones del sitio del proyecto, incluyendo el aparcamiento de Point of Pines, perturbaría temporalmente el tráfico local. - Los impactos a corto plazo sobre el tráfico en Hanson Street afectarían a los patrones de tráfico en la vecindad comercial/industrial durante la instalación de la tubería en el camino. - Podría haber impactos a corto plazo en la calidad del aire en el área del proyecto por el funcionamiento temporal de la maquinaria utilizada en las actividades de construcción. Se aplicarían las mejores prácticas de gestión (BMP) para controlar las emisiones de la construcción con el fin de minimizar el polvo y las emisiones. - A corto plazo, habría un impacto en los niveles de ruido en la zona del proyecto durante la construcción, principalmente por los equipos mecánicos utilizados para las actividades de construcción. Los impactos sonoros se minimizarán en la medida de lo posible con medidas que incluyan la prevención de la actividad innecesaria de los motores en ralentí de los vehículos. - Impactos a corto plazo en el acceso público al Sendero Comunitario de Lynn y a un segmento del sendero adyacente para peatones y ciclistas a orillas del agua durante la construcción. 3No se espera que estos impactos afecten de manera desproporcionada a las poblaciones de Justicia Ambiental. 7. Identifique los beneficios del proyecto, incluyendo los \"Beneficios Ambientales\", tal como se definen en la norma 301 CMR 11.02, que pueden mejorar las condiciones ambientales o la salud pública de la población de Justicia Ambiental El proyecto traería consigo los siguientes beneficios para las poblaciones de Justicia Ambiental, así como para el público en general: - La tubería de agua de la Sección 56 de la MWRA suministra agua a los residentes y negocios de las ciudades de Revere y Lynn. Con este proyecto se asegurará la redundancia y fiabilidad del sistema de agua, que es crucial para proteger la salud pública y ambiental. Al reemplazar esta tubería se asegurará el suministro continuo de agua para el consumo, la protección contra incendios y el saneamiento. Las poblaciones de Justicia Ambiental que recibirán servicio por esta tubería, así como la comunidad en general, se beneficiarán por la seguridad que este reemplazo de tuberías dará al suministro de agua para la zona. 8. Describa cómo puede la comunidad solicitar una reunión para debatir el proyecto y cómo puede solicitar servicios de interpretación oral en la reunión. Especifique cómo solicitar otros ajustes, incluyendo reuniones fuera del horario laboral y en lugares cercanos al transporte público.

The Traffic Assessment and Control memo provides a comprehensive investigation and evaluation of all traffic related aspects of the Project. This includes: • Traffic impacts associated with temporary traffic control setups. • Construction vehicle routes. • Impacts to on street parking. • Construction work hour restrictions. Project Description The Section 56 Main Saugus River Crossing is a water main replacement project over the Saugus River between Lynn and Revere Massachusetts. The proposed water main will cross Route 1A at the intersection of Hanson Street and Route 1A then run parallel to Hanson Street on the south side. The water main will then cross the Saugus River at the end of Hanson Street (Lynn, MA) and connect to Rice Ave (Revere, MA). The water main will run parallel to Rice Ave on the north side and connect to the existing water main near the intersection of Whitin Ave and Lynnway. A figure of the proposed water main location is shown in Figure 1. 1/9Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Figure 1 – Proposed Water Main Location AECOM 2/9Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Description of Roadways The impacted roadways due to construction is shown in Table 1 with roadway classification and jurisdiction indicated. Route 1A: Route 1A is a multi-lane roadway that runs in the North/South direction connecting Boston in the South to Northeastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine in the North. The area of construction for this project occurs at the intersection of Route 1A and Hanson Street in Lynn, MA. This intersection is located in a commercially developed area with several businesses in the immediate vicinity. Business hours are generally 7AM to 9PM for businesses within 1,000 feet of the area of construction. There is no parking allowed on Route 1A. The lane configuration for each approach is as follows: • Route 1A Northbound: Three through lanes. • Hanson Street Westbound: One left turn lane and one right turn lane. • Route 1A Southbound: Three through lanes and one southbound left turn lane. Hanson Street: Hanson Street is approximately forty-five feet wide with one lane of traffic in each direction and two-hour parking allowed on both sides. Hanson street is a local street that provides access to two business developments from Route 1A. Hanson Street provides no connections to other roadways and is terminated on one end. At the road terminus there is a gate blocking vehicle access. There is a sidewalk on both sides of the road. Pedestrians may continue beyond the gate and access the Lynn Community Path. Rice Ave: Rice Ave ranges between approximately eighteen feet wide to twenty-two feet wide with one lane of traffic in each direction. No parking is permitted on Rice Ave. Rice Ave is a local street in a dense residential neighborhood. There is a non-continuous sidewalk on the north side of the street. Several side streets intersect with Rice Ave. These side streets are all one-way southbound roadways. Intersection of Rice Ave, Whitin Ave and Lynnway: Lynnway is a one-way street that provides access to Rice Ave and Whitin Ave from Route 1A. Whitin Ave is a one-way street in the southbound direction. Rice Ave is a two-direction street. Vehicles entering the intersection from Rice Ave must make a left turn on to Whitin Ave. Table 1.

A description of work, proposed traffic control setup, proposed working hours, parking restrictions, and detours for each impacted roadway are described in the following sections. Intersection of Route 1A and Hanson Street (Lynn, MA) Construction at this intersection will consist of installation of a proposed water main across Route 1A. The water main will cross along the southern approach of the intersection then continue down Hanson Street. AECOM 3/9Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Proposed traffic control setup: The proposed temporary traffic control setup will involve a sequence of single lane closures to cross the intersection. Only a single lane will be closed at any given time in either direction to maintain traffic flow along Route 1A. Proposed working hours: Temporary traffic control setups will be in place during off-peak traffic hours (overnight). This will minimize the impact to travelers on Route 1A and impacts to access points for nearby businesses. Parking restrictions and detours: Parking restrictions and detours will not be required for this area of work. Hanson Street (Lynn, MA) Construction on Hanson Street will consist of installation of a proposed water main located in the southern shoulder. Proposed traffic control setup: The proposed temporary traffic control setup will involve a sequence of shoulder closures along the south side of Hanson Street. To maintain existing driveway access points for businesses on Hanson Street, only one driveway will be blocked at any given time. Existing pedestrian facilities will be maintained, and a fence will be provided on the edge of the sidewalk. Proposed working hours: Temporary traffic control setups will be in place during off-peak traffic hours (6pm to 6am). Parking restrictions and detours: Parking restrictions and detours will not be required for this area of work. Rice Ave (Revere, MA) Construction on Rice Ave will consist of installation of a proposed water main located outside the roadway in the grass strip on the north side of Rice Avenue. There is approximately 250’ of proposed water main located within the roadway near the intersection of Rice Ave and Whitin Ave (northwest of the yacht club). Proposed traffic control setup: The proposed temporary traffic control setup at the intersection of Whitin Ave and Rice Ave will involve narrowing the roadway and maintaining all existing traffic movements. Construction vehicles and equipment will be located off the roadway on the north side of Rice Ave to provide a minimum of one travel lane. The section of water main installation on Rice Ave between Whitin Ave and Fowler Ave will require a short section of alternating one- way traffic with a police officer to direct vehicles during construction hours. The roadway will be covered with steel plates at the end of each work shift, so that no alternating one-way setup will be required during off-peak hours. No further traffic control setups are required for HDD Route 7. Special consideration if HDD Route 3 is selected In the instance that HDD Route 3 is selected, the installation of a water main along the full length of Rice Ave will require additional setup for traffic control with detours. The proposed temporary traffic control setup along Rice Ave will involve a sequence of eastbound traffic closures. Equipment and vehicles will be located on the north side of Rice Ave (in the westbound travel lane) and westbound traffic will be shifted to the south side of Rice Ave in the eastbound travel lane. Traffic will move in the westbound direction only for each work area. Segments will be short enough to maintain existing driveway and side street access. For every segment of construction, detour signage will be provided at the nearest upstream side street to re-route traffic down the side street and to Rice Ave westbound. Pedestrian sidewalks will be maintained through the duration of construction. Figure 2 below shows a typical work setup along Rice Ave with Rice Ave WB traffic shifted and Rice Ave EB traffic detoured down the nearest upstream side street. AECOM 4/9Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Figure 2 - Typical Rice Ave EB Detour Additionally, equipment staging at the end of Rice Ave will be required to install the water main across the Saugus River. Figure 3 below depicts the necessary equipment locations and space requirements to install the pipe across the Saugus River. This setup is only required for a short duration but will require a partial road closure and detour. Approximately five residences will lose vehicle access to their driveway and will require temporary off-site parking. Residents will need to access their home via the sidewalk from the off-site parking location. Construction schedules will be communicated in advance to these residences, so that they may plan accordingly. AECOM 5/9Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Figure 3 - Equipment Staging for HDD Route 3 AECOM 6/9Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Proposed working hours: Construction activities will take place during daytime hours (8am to 5pm). Parking restrictions: There is currently no parking allowed on Rice Ave. This will be strictly enforced during construction to allow activities to take place. Detours: A detour will be required if HDD Route 3 is selected and provided for each segment of construction along Rice Ave as needed. Vehicles will be rerouted down a side street off Rice Ave and directed to make a left at the end of the street to Rice Ave and continue on Rice Ave WB until their destination. At the HDD-3 Exit Point, residential traffic will be rerouted for off-site parking. The standard temporary traffic control details that will be utilized during construction have been attached at the end of this memo. Construction Vehicle Access Construction vehicles are needed to remove debris from the site and to deliver new construction materials as the project proceeds. The impact of construction traffic in the peak hours is expected to be marginal due to off-hour deliveries and debris load-out. Truck activity is expected to be uniform for each area of construction work hours. In the case where HDD Route 7 is selected, construction vehicle access will be straightforward and construction vehicles will be able to drive to the construction site directly with little impact to surrounding residents. Construction vehicles will be able to have enough room to maneuver at the Point of Pines Yacht Club and thereby limit the need for specific routes for construction vehicles. Special consideration if HDD Route 3 is selected In the event HDD Route 3 is selected, AECOM is requiring trucks use specific routes to access each work zone. A truck circulation plan is provided in Figure 4 that depicts the truck routes. These selected truck routes are based upon: • The directionality of side streets. • The narrow width of Rice Ave and inability of trucks to reverse direction. It is anticipated that all trucks arriving at the work site on Rice Ave will not be able to reverse direction. For this reason, arrival routes will have two categories: trucks arriving from the west and trucks arriving from the east (Figure 4 Green Routes). Trucks arriving on Rice Ave from the west: • Make a left on to Lynnway from Route 1A exit ramp • Make right on to Rice Ave Trucks arriving on Rice Ave from the east: • Make a left on to Lynnway from Route 1A exit ramp • Make a right on to Whitin Ave • Make a left on to Rice Ave Similarly, it is anticipated that departing trucks will not be able to reverse direction. For this reason, departing routes will have two categories: trucks departing Rice Ave and going west and trucks departing Rice Ave and going east (Figure 4 Red Routes). Westbound trucks departing Rice Ave: • Continue on Rice Ave • Turn left to Whitin Ave • Turn Right to Rice Ave • Turn Right to Chamberlain Ave • Turn to Route 1A AECOM 7/9Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Eastbound trucks departing Rice Ave: • Continue on Rice Ave • Turn right to Chamberlain Ave • Turn right to Lynnway • Turn to Route 1A AECOM 8/9Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Figure 4- Proposed Construction Vehicle Circulation Plan AECOM 9/9ATTACHMENT M Feasibility StuFdeya asnibdil iRtyo uStteu dSyelection MatrixEXHIBIT 3 Feasibility StudyWeston & Sampson 5 Centennial Drive, Peabody, MA 01960 (HQ) Tel: 978.532 1900 MWRA Contract No. 7500 Weston & Sampson Project No. 2150821 June 09, 2017 Geetha Mathiyalakan Program Manager MWRA — Engineering & Construction 2 Griffin Way Chelsea, MA 02150 Re:(cid:9) Subtask 3.3 - Final Report MWRA Contract No. 7500 Dear Mrs. Mathiyalakan, In accordance with Contract No 7500 Subtasks 3.3 please find attached the Feasibility Study Final Report.

The 20-inch diameter steel water transmission main has been taken out-of-service at its crossing of the Saugus River due to a history of leaks and bursts. The MWRA wishes to evaluate options to restore reliable water transmission through Section 56 at its crossing of the Saugus River. The MWRA secured Weston & Sampson to perform a feasibility study to evaluate rehabilitation and replacement alternatives for a future capital improvements project. The Weston & Sampson project team, including sub consultants McMillen Jacobs Associates and Green International Affiliates, performed feasibility study services from December 2015 to May 2017. Tasks included field reconnaissance, review of existing conditions records, evaluation of installation methods and route alternatives, screening and ranking of alternatives, and detailed study of the two highly ranked route alternatives. The team coordinated progress with the MWRA through memoranda detailing work progress and periodic project meetings. Field reconnaissance and pipe inspection revealed that the existing pipe and pipe supports are generally in poor condition. The existing conditions review identified known environmental releases in the area, subsurface conditions near the bridge alignment, general nature of historic and existing structures, applicable resource area limits, abutters, and development interests in the project area. Eight (8) potential pipe replacement route alignments were identified in the project area. Four (4) pipe installation methods were considered, including open trench river crossing, horizontal directional drilling, microtunneling, and removal and replacement on the bridge. Route alternatives were screened with respect to pipeline performance, program risks, cost, and schedule. Screening and ranking identified two highly rated horizontal directional drilling (HDD) pipe replacement alternatives extending from Hanson Street in the City of Lynn to Rice Avenue in the City of Revere (Route 3 and Route 7). The microtunneling alternative was rated favorably from a performance and risk perspective, but had the highest cost and a longer schedule duration. The open trench river crossing alternative was comparable in cost to HDD options, but included greater environmental risk, greater permitting difficulty, and a longer schedule duration. The pipe replacement on bridge alternative scored less favorably due to reduced protection against damage, hydraulic limitations, greater technical complexity, and greater construction risk. Weston & Sampson recommends that Route 3 and Route 7 be carried forward into preliminary design. Both HDD routes shares drill entry on Hanson Street in Lynn. Route 3 has drill exit near the end of the Point of Pines on Rice Avenue, and Route 7 has drill exit near the Point of Pines Yacht Club off Rice Avenue. Route 3 is viewed as having less risk of conflict with known and unknown structures due to its orientation relative to the Lynn Seawall and other obstructions, as well as its location outside of the historically developed areas inside the mouth of the Saugus River, among other advantages. Route 7 is of lower cost and lower construction duration, among other advantages. Risks associated with obstruction by the seawall, easement acquisition, and abutter concerns will be fully evaluated and better understood in preliminary design after execution of the recommended subsurface exploration program, engagement of abutters, and initiation of access/easement negotiation. Route 3 has an estimated program cost of $10,651,147, requires 7-months of construction operations, and has an estimated project completion date in October 2021. Route 7 has an estimated program cost of $9,947,248, requires about 6-months of construction operations, and has an estimated project completion date in September 2021. O:\\MWRA\\2150821-Bridge Crossing FS\\C7500 File\\13 Subtasks\\3.3 Final Feasibility Study\\Feasibility Study Final Report.docx ES-1 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 1.0 INTRODUCTION The MWRA wishes to evaluate the most feasible, cost-effective, methodology for replacing the Section 56 water main where it crosses the Saugus River on the General Edwards Bridge between the City of Revere and the City of Lynn, Massachusetts. Weston & Sampson was retained under Contract 7500, Engineering Services to Conduct Feasibility Study for Section 56 General Edwards Bridge Crossing of the Saugus River (the Project), to perform professional services in support of this goal. 1.1 General Section 56 at the General Edwards Bridge was constructed in 1934. The water main is buried 20-inch diameter cast iron pipe in its approaches to the bridge in the City of Revere (Revere Beach Boulevard and the Lynnway) and the City of Lynn (the Lynnway). The water main crosses the Saugus River supported by the General Edwards Bridge superstructure, except through the navigation channel, where the Figure 1 – Overview of Section 56 water main passes below the existing navigation channel via a tunnel. The buried 20-inch diameter cast iron pipe in streets transitions to 20- inch diameter flanged steel pipe on the General Edwards Bridge and 30-inch diameter steel pipe at the tunnel system. Section 56 supplies water to residential, commercial and industrial properties in Revere and Lynn, and provides redundancy for Sections 27 and 91 that service the Northern High Service Zone communities of Lynn, Nahant, Swampscott and Marblehead. Section 56 has experienced several leaks and bursts, with a considerable number at the bridge crossing, where the above-grade portions of the pipe have experienced severe corrosion. Section 56 is currently shutdown at meter 126 because of the leaks and bursts. Section 27 and Section 91 cross the Saugus River north of its confluence with the Pines River. Section 26 is currently out of service at the Salem Turnpike river crossing. 1.2 Purpose The MWRA wishes to restore reliable water transmission through Section 56 at its crossing of the Saugus River. This feasibility study was to evaluate pipe rehabilitation and replacement alternatives and recommend the most favorable alternative that meets the MWRA’s long term goals for reliable water system performance in the project area. Alternatives evaluation was to include water main replacement 1-1 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY on the bridge, open trench water main installation, and water main installation via trenchless installation methods. Alternatives were evaluated for technical feasibility, estimated costs, potential environmental impacts, permit requirements, easement/land acquisition requirements, potential utility conflicts, traffic impacts, connections to the existing pipe, installation of valves and other appurtenances and estimated construction schedule. The results of this study are intended to be used to guide the design of the Section 56 water main replacement. The project does not address replacing existing below-grade portions of Section 56 in Revere or Lynn. 1.3 Project Team The Project team included Weston & Sampson as the engineering lead and McMillen Jacobs Associates and Green International Affiliates as subconsultants. Weston & Sampson’s organization and management approach for was intended to maximize the expertise brought by each team member. A Quality Assurance and Quality Control Manual was prepared to detailed staff organization and role responsibility. The majority of work was provided by Weston & Sampson from their headquarters in Peabody, Massachusetts. Support evaluating trenchless technology options was provided by McMillen Jacobs Associates from their Burlington Massachusetts office. Inspection of the existing Section 56 water main, and support of the on bridge pipe replacement alternative, was provided by Green International Affiliates, from their Westford Massachusetts office. 1.4 Schedule Overview The Project Notice to Proceed was issued on December 4, 2015. Field reconnaissance began on December 14, 2015, and concluded with a memorandum dated February 25, 2016. Review of existing records was performed in the first quarter of 2016. Memoranda summarizing environmental and geotechnical records review were submitted in April 2016. Installation methods and route alignments were evaluated in the first and second quarters of 2016. A draft memorandum summarizing installation methods and route alternatives was submitted in April 2016. Screening and ranking of alternatives was performed in the second quarter of 2016 and Figure 2- General Edwards Bridge North Elevation results were submitted in July 2016. A workshop was held in September 2016 to discuss installation methods, route alternatives, and screening and ranking. In the months following the workshop, various meetings with stakeholders were conducted. In November 2016, revised route alternatives and screening and ranking memoranda were finalized. The MWRA authorized Weston & Sampson to proceed with a detailed review of the recommended alternative in January 2017. The MWRA expanded the scope of detailed review in February 2017 via contract Task Order 3. Detailed review deliverables were submitted in March 2017. This Final Report was submitted in June 2017. 1-2 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 1.5 Project References Project references acquired throughout the course of the feasibility study have been logged and saved to the project file for record.

Inspection revealed that the existing Section 56 water main supported on the General Edwards Bridge is in poor to serious condition. Typical pitting on the exterior of the water main was 0.125 to 0.25 inches deep. Three (3) locations of previous pipe blowout were observed. Pipe extending to tunnel shafts, as well as at the top of each tunnel shaft, were observed in poor condition. Many pipe supports were observed in poor condition. 2.1 Overview The General Edwards Memorial Bridge, L‐18‐ 015(4D7), (the Bridge) was built in 1934 and is a bascule bridge (also referred to as a drawbridge). The Bridge spans the Saugus River between the City of Lynn and the City of Revere. The south abutment of the Bridge is in the City of Revere and the north abutment is in the City of Lynn. The Bridge is part of Massachusetts State Route 1A and has been under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) since 2009, when it was transferred from Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) jurisdiction. Massachusetts State Route 1A North is named “the Lynnway” north of the General Edwards Bridge in Lynn, and “North Shore Road” south of the General Edwards Bridge in Revere. Massachusetts State Route 1A is a multi-lane Figure 3- Orthophoto of General Edwards Bridge arterial roadway and provides regional connection along the shoreline between East Boston/Revere to the south and Swampscott/Salem to the north. The Lynnway is under DCR jurisdiction and North Shore Road is under MassDOT jurisdiction. The Section 56 water main at the Saugus River crossing was built when the bridge was constructed. The pipe is mounted on the under- side of the bridge and is a 20” diameter flanged steel pipe with 1/2” wall thickness. The pipe is supported by the bridge structure in the spans approaching the bascule. In these spans, the Figure 4 - Typical Configuration of Pipe, Support Beams, pipe rests on radially cut I-beams welded to and Timber Plank Walkway 2-1 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY bridge support beams. There are no pipe rollers associated with this system, so the pipe can slide within each radially cut beam section. At the movable leaf of the bascule bridge, bends orient the water main to within the bridge towers, across bridge fenders, and into the tunnel system, as shown in Figure 5, Tunnel Plan 1934. 2.2 Pipeline Inspection The Section 56 water main on the General Edwards Bridge was inspected by Green International in December 2015 as part of the feasibility study. Access to the structure was gained by using an under-bridge inspection unit (a “snooper” truck) and ladders at the bridge ends. The MWRA inspection was performed December 14, 15, 16, and 23, 2015. Green International Affiliates performed a subsequent inspection as part of a MassDOT inspection contract on January 28 and 29, 2016. The remainder of report Section 2.2 is taken from the Green International Affiliates memorandum to Weston & Sampson titled “Water Main Condition Findings”, dated February 25, 2016. Green International Affiliates performed a hands‐on inspection of the entire exposed length of the existing water main, its supports and end connections throughout the bridge approach spans, the tower transition areas, and the water pipe tunnel entrance shafts. They compared available record plan information with what was found and measured in the field. Areas of deterioration were identified on a framing plan from the applicable record drawings, as attached in Appendix B. Figure 5 - Tunnel Plan 1934 At the time of the inspection, material samples were taken by the Green International Affiliates inspection team and an MWRA welding crew in the form of steel pipe coupons, insulation samples and bridge steel and pipe coatings. These samples, aside from the steel coupon, were taken to identify possible hazardous material content. Select photographs, sketches, and field notes from the pipeline inspection are Figure 6 – Typical Deteriorated Pipe Support and Support Beams 2-2 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY attached to this report in Appendix B. 2.2.1 Pipe in Bridge Approach Spans The water main pipe, supported by the bridge superstructure, was found to be in poor condition with three failure areas noted. There are numerous areas of damaged or removed insulation wrap in each span. The exposed steel pipe in these areas typically has rusted and pitted surfaces all around the pipe, as shown in Figure 7, Typical Exposed Pipe Condition. The typical pitted surfaces were up to 15% of the outer perimeter and up to 1/8” deep. There is a black protective tar coating (deteriorated) on the outside of the pipe. Figure 7 - Typical Exposed Pipe Condition Pipe blowout or rupture areas were found on the bridge in spans 8, 10, & 13. One rupture is shown in Figure 8, Pipe Blowout Area Span 10 with Coupon Cutout. Failure appeared to have been a result of the pipe splitting along a seam weld. There were several areas of exposed pipe where there was up to 0.25 inch deep pitting of the steel pipe over approximately 70% of the pipe perimeter. Similarly pitted areas were found at the pipe blowout/rupture locations and direct caliper measurements of 0.25 inch remaining steel thickness were taken. Figure 8 - Pipe Blowout Area Span 10 with Coupon Cutout The pipe has a series of 90-degree bends in spans 5 and 7 where the pipe turns to the west then turns into the bridge towers, as shown in Figure 9, Insulated Pipe at Bend. The insulation layer in these bend lengths of pipe was of a different material type than the main horsehair type insulation and was typically deteriorating. Figure 9 - Insulated Pipe at Bend and Twisted/Deteriorated Support Beams at Span 5 2-3 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 2.2.2 Pipe Inside Towers The pipe inside the towers was found to have a combination insulation layer and was generally intact or had been maintained with repairs made. Both tower water main sections were found to be in satisfactory condition, as shown in Figure 10, South Tower Pipe Condition. 2.2.3 Pipe to Tunnel Shaft The pipe outside the south tower was found to have a replacement protective layer installed and the pipe was not visible for inspection. The north tower pipe was exposed and has a similar pitted condition as was found on the approach span exposed pipes, as Figure 10 - South Tower Pipe Condition shown in Figure 11, North Exposed Pipe Section to Tunnel Shaft. The tunnel shaft was inspected from the top of each shaft structure. The tunnel pipe was not inspected as part of the project. Within both tunnel shafts water was found pooling on top of the pipe and the surrounding concrete fill. The South Tunnel Shaft has an access opening cut from the concrete slab on top of the shaft, as shown in Figure 12, Inside South Tunnel Shaft. The measured top of the water surface was approximately 56” from the underside of the concrete cap slab with an average water depth of 40” to solid concrete fill. There was soft material at the east shaft with a maximum depth to solid concrete of 52” or 96” from the underside of the concrete cap to solid concrete. A sketch depicting these measurements is included in Appendix B. The North Tunnel Shaft manhole was opened but measurements were more difficult to obtain. The distance from the underside of the manhole frame to the solid concrete was found to be approximately 74” with an 8” average water depth. A maximum water depth in soft material was found to be 21”. Figure 11 – North Exposed Pipe Section to Tunnel Shaft Both pipe conditions were as expected inside the shaft area and were deteriorated similar to the other typical exposed pipe areas with 0.25” deep pitting. The pipe Figure 12 - Inside South Tunnel Shaft visible inside the shafts is in poor condition. 2-4 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 2.2.4 Supports and Support Beams The pipe supports and support beams were found to be in poor condition overall throughout the approach spans. Typically, when the pipe support was found to be excessively deteriorated, the correspon- ding support beam was also found to be excessively deteriorated. Four (4) specific locations in Spans 3, 5, 10, & 12 were found to have deteriorated to a point where no loads are recommended to be placed on the support beams. A total of seven (7) pipe stabilizer frames were installed in spans 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 per the 1935 design plans. Stabilizer frames were located at the pipe expansion joint flanges to maintain alignment at the joints. The stabilizer frames were positively Figure 13 - Tunnel Shaft Profile 1934 attached to the pipe itself (typically bolted to a flange) and secured to the bridge by way of welds to the adjacent girder web. All of the girder webs at the welded connections where cracked welds were found were bulged by the apparent pulling or pushing against the girder web from the stabilizer frame ends. Some of these cracked welds were found to have propagated into the girder webs in spans 5, 9, & 11, as shown in Figure 14, Cracked Girder Web Span 11. The cracked welds and girder webs were immediately brought to the attention of the MWRA and MassDOT by the project team. Subsequent inspection of the stabilizer to girder connections was performed on January 28 and 29, 2016, by Green International Affiliates through a separate contract with MassDOT. 2.2.5 Conclusions The water main in the bridge approach spans is in poor to serious condition with typical pitted surfaces 0.125 inch deep and up to 0.25 inch deep with three blowout areas. The tower Figure 14 - Cracked Girder Web portions of the pipe were not visible for inspection. The tunnel Span 11 shaft exposed pipe areas are in poor condition. 2-5 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 2.3 Analysis of Coatings & Insulation Inspection in December 2015 revealed pipe insulation and coatings which might contain asbestos and/or metals of concern. Under feasibility study Additional Services Task Order No. 2, Weston & Sampson collected samples of readily available deteriorated materials to test pipe coatings for asbestos and lead, pipe insulations for asbestos, and pipe support coatings for RCRA 8 metals. The intent of sampling was to inform ongoing operations and maintenance on the Section 56 water main, inform the water main replacement feasibility study so that program scope, cost, and permitting could be estimated more accurately, and to inform future water main replacement design scope of work. The remainder of Section 2.3 of this report includes excerpt from the Weston & Sampson Memorandum “Hazardous Building Materials Investigation Services”, finalized June 29, 2016, as attached to this report as Appendix C. 2.3.1 Asbestos Weston & Sampson performed the bulk sampling in the area according to methods outlined in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance document titled, \"Guidance for Controlling Asbestos- Containing Materials in Buildings\" (Document No. 560/5-85/024). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines an Asbestos-Containing Material as a material that contains greater than one percent (1%) asbestos. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection defines an Asbestos-Containing Material (“ACM”) as a material that contains greater than or equal to one percent (1%) asbestos. Asbestos in concentrations greater than or equal to one percent (1%) was detected in four (4) of the materials sampled by Weston & Sampson. The following insulations were identified as asbestos-containing materials during the investigation: • Tar paper and horsehair insulation, typical of most indoor and outdoor pipeline installation. The horsehair, while not asbestos containing itself, should be treated as part of an asbestos containing material because it is impractical to separate it from the asbestos containing tar paper. • Fibrous insulations, typically at joints, sometimes wrapped in tar paper The presence of asbestos on the property does not necessarily mean that the health of abutters or operators at the site are endangered. Asbestos fibers present a serious health hazard only when they become airborne after being released from the material in which they are bound. ACMs Figure 15 - Fibrous Insulation Sample are most likely to be disturbed during maintenance, repair, Location No 4 or renovation activities. Future pipeline rehabilitation or demolition work must address the proper handling and disposal of both the asbestos containing materials and metals (described further below) identified at the site. The generation of an asbestos abatement removal specification is recommended in order to identify acceptable means and methods of performing asbestos abatement under EPA and Massachusetts regulations. 2.3.2 Lead Lead screening of pipe coatings revealed that neither sample contained levels of lead greater than the EPA residential standard of 0.50% lead by weight. The results of the samples ranged from 0.011% lead by weight to 0.079% lead by weight. However, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration 2-6 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY (OSHA) Lead in Construction Standard 29 CFR 1926.62 considers any detectable level of lead to be a potential for exposure if dust is generated from disturbance of surfaces coated with paint containing lead. OSHA defines any detectable concentration of lead in paint as a potential lead exposure hazard to workers doing construction/demolition-type work on these surfaces as even small concentrations of lead can result in unacceptable employee exposures depending upon the method of removal and other workplace conditions. Since these conditions can vary greatly, the lead-in-construction standard was written to require exposure monitoring or the use of historical or objective data to ensure that employee exposures do not exceed the Action Level of 30 micrograms per cubic meter of air (μg/m3). The contractor must provide respiratory protection, protective work clothing and equipment, change areas, hand washing facilities, biological monitoring, and training until an exposure assessment has determined that the work activity will result in an exposure below the permissible exposure limit. Additional requirements under this standard include a written compliance program as well as record keeping. 2.3.3 Metals (RCRA-8) The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) monitors contaminants that are considered environmentally hazardous because they exhibit characteristics of corrosivity, toxicity, ignitability, or reactivity. Weston & Sampson performed metals testing of a pipe support coating for RCRA-8 metals that are commonly found in industrial coatings. “20 Time Rule” TCLP Analyte Result (mg/Kg) Analysis Threshold (mg/Kg) Arsenic ND 100 Barium 3,700 2,000 Cadmium 11 20 Chromium 1,200 100 Lead 180,000 100 Selenium 5.3 20 Silver ND 100 Mercury 1.1 4 Table 1 - RCRA-8 Metals Sample Results Barium, Chromium and Lead concentrations were greater than “20 times” their hazardous waste toxicity threshold (i.e. the 20-times rule). If pipe coatings are to be removed and disposed, Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) analyses should be performed to determine requirements. If the metal and coatings are removed as a whole component (metal with coatings still applied) and recycled, TCLP is not necessary, as bulk scrap metal items being recycled are not subject to MassDEP Hazardous Waste Regulations (310 CMR 30.202(5)f). Should any of the analytes fail TCLP analyses, the pipe support coating will be considered a hazardous waste and disposal will be governed by RCRA and MassDEP Hazardous Waste Regulations. The coating should be handled as a hazardous waste until further testing, using the TCLP analysis, confirms the waste’s toxicity characteristic results. Given that handling method impacts disposal requirements it is recommended that a project specific specification for removal and disposal of coatings containing metals be prepared to define acceptable means and methods for removal and disposal in accordance with EPA and Massachusetts regulations. Typically, metals in coatings present a health hazard only when disturbed during maintenance, repair, or renovation activities. The handling of these materials must be performed in accordance with the health 2-7 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY and safety measures outlined in OSHA regulations. Contractors should be informed prior to working when coatings containing metals exist on a work premise. Due to the presence of several of the metals in elevated concentrations, a contractor will likely be required to provide respiratory protection, protective work clothing and equipment, change areas, hand washing facilities, biological monitoring, and training until an exposure assessment has determined that the work activity will result in an exposure below the permissible exposure limit for any of the materials listed above.

The study area is also within various state and federal resource areas which will impact requirements of water main installation. This section of the report details the study area abutting the Section 56 crossing of the Saugus River at the General Edwards Bridge. 3.1 Site Features Site features and existing conditions will impact cost and feasibility of replacement alternatives at the Section 56 at the crossing of the Saugus River. Site features were identified in records review and field reconnaissance and compiled for presentation in the “Route Alternatives of Existing Conditions Plan”, attached in Appendix D. 3.1.1 General Edwards Bridge Condition An overview of the General Edwards Bridge was briefly described in Section 2.0 of this report. The Federal Highway Administration National Bridge Inventory (available online) indicates that the last inspection of the General Edwards Bridge was performed in June 2014 and that deck, superstructure, and substructure condition ratings were “5”, “5”, and “4”, respectively. A structurally deficient bridge is one for which the deck, superstructure, or substructure is rated 4 or less. This is based on a scale of 1 to 9, with a score of 9 being “excellent” and 0 being “imminent failure”. Therefore, the bridge is currently rated “structurally deficient”. The National Bridge Inventory identifies that the Bridge was last reconstructed in 1990, that the “Bridge is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places”, and that recommended work includes “Replacement of bridge or other structure because of substandard load carrying capacity or substandard bridge roadway geometry”. MassDOT has an open project number 608396, titled “Lynn-Revere Bridge Reconstruction”. Per an exchange between the MWRA and MassDOT in September 2016, a representative from MassDOT indicated that funds to design this project have not been secured, and that it is not likely to happen within the next 10 years. General Edwards Bridge replacement is a risk to the MWRA Section 56 water main in the existing bridge corridor. 3.1.2 Historic Wood Deck Bridge An existing wood deck bridge pre-dated the General Edwards Bridge and occupied a space immediately to the east of the exiting Bridge. Figure 17, Historic Bridge Alignment, indicates in a 1933 conceptual rendering the existing bridge immediately to the east of the proposed bridge. Similar to the General Edwards Bridge, this bridge had fenders extending laterally from the bridge alignment and likely rested on an extensive subsurface support system comprised of wooden piers. Figure 17 - Historic Bridge Alignment 3-1 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.1.3 Historic Railroad Bridge West of the General Edwards Bridge exists a historic railroad bridge which has been repurposed as a fishing pier and cooling water intake to the now-closed GE Gearworks Plant. The railroad bridge at one time had a rotating platform to provide passage over the navigation channel and large fenders to Figure 18 - Historic Railroad Bridge (North) protect and guide boats through the channel. 3.1.4 Existing and Historic Electric Transmission Assets Overhead and submarine electric transmission assets cross the Saugus River west of the General Edwards Bridge. The submarine cable is located immediately west of the Bridge in the north half of the river, then it shifts to the west of the historic railroad bridge around the middle of the river. Overhead transmission assets exist west of the submarine cable and cross the Saugus River on a diagonal. On land, electric transmission assets run north in an easement immediately behind premises west of the Lynnway. Historically, these electrical transmission Figure 19 - Historic Power Lines in Harbor Area assets crossed the Lynnway just north of the Bridge and occupied the harborfront parcels east of the General Edwards Bridge. The overhead power lines were relocated through a local, state, and private effort oriented towards taking Lynn Harbor back for beneficial use. Power line relocation from the shore was performed in 2010 with funding, in-part, by a state Massworks grant. The Lynn Harbor parcels cleared of powerlines have not been developed for alternative land use at the time of this study. 3.1.5 Lynn Fishing Pier The DCR owns and maintains a fishing pier to the east of the General Edwards Bridge referred to as Lynn Fishing Pier. The pier is accessed by footpath from the Lynnway. The DCR has easements to maintain footpath access to the fishing pier. Figure 20 - Lynn Fishing Pier (DCR) 3-2 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.1.6 Seasonal Boat Moorings Seasonal boat moorings exist in Revere to the east of the General Edwards Bridge. The moorings are associated with the Point of Pines Yacht Club and are used for recreational maritime activities. Figure 21 - Seasonal Moorings 3.1.7 Existing and Historic Piles The existing Bridge, historic bridge, historic railroad bridge, all bridge fender systems, and all fishing and boating piers in the area are likely supported by significant numbers of piles. Record Drawings indicate vertical and battered timber piles supporting the existing General Edwards Bridge, with battered piles radiating laterally from the supported structure at 1:4 angle. Figure 22 - Bridge Fenders (West) and Railroad Bridge (South) Figure 23 - Bridge Fenders (East) 3.1.8 Revere Seawall A seawall exists in Revere east of the General Edwards Bridge between Rice Avenue and the shore. The seawall is of unknown dimensions and construction. Figure 24 - Revere Seawall (East) 3-3 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.1.9 Lynn Seawall A seawall exists in Lynn east and west of the General Edwards Bridge for the entire Lynn shoreline within the project area. The date of construction and depth is unknown. The 1973 Fish Pier drawings indicate the wall is a timber bulkhead with horizontal tie rods to a deadman anchor wall 30-feet inland. The seawall is observed to be in poor condition, with the bulkhead washed out in many locations and evidence of resulting shoreline erosion. The Lynn Economic Development and Industrial Corporation (EDIC) indicates that there may be an effort in the future to replace a section of the seawall. Figure 25 - Lynn Seawall (East) 3.1.10 Historic Municipal Landfill A closed municipal landfill exists on parcels owned by National Grid north of Hanson Street on the Lynn Harbor shoreline. The landfill was capped in 1986 and no known alternative use of the space is ongoing. The municipal landfill resides about 150 feet from the Lynn seawall bulkhead. 3.1.11 Historic Industrial Land Use at the GE Gearworks Facility Parcels to the west of the Lynnway once comprised an industrial site owned by GE, named Gearworks. The 500,000 square foot plant was developed in 1941 and manufactured main propulsion gear boxes for destroyers, nuclear carriers, and submarines. The Gearworks plant was closed and demolished in 2011 and has remained vacant since that time. Development proposed at this property is described in Section 3.5.5. At this time, several utility-related buildings and tanks are scheduled to remain near the shoreline, and the remainder of the site is scheduled for mixed-use commercial/residential development. This site will be subject to extensive construction operations and change of use in the coming years as the development plan is executed. 3.2 Regulatory and Resource Areas The General Edwards Bridge is within a tidally influenced zone just prior to the confluence of the Saugus River and Lynn Harbor. Immediately upstream of the Bridge is the Rumney Marsh and the confluence of the Pines River and the Saugus River. The site is subject to various regulatory and resource restrictions that will impact construction operations and permit requirements. These resource areas were considered in identification of probable permits required of route alternatives. Boundaries of areas are identified in the “Route Alternatives Over Existing Conditions Plan”, attached in Appendix D, where applicable. 3-4 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.2.1 ACOE Navigation Channel The General Edwards Bridge area is tidally influenced and contains a US Army Corps of Engineers (“ACOE”) Federal Navigation Project (“FNP”). The Saugus River FNP has an “Authorized Project Depth” 8.0 feet below mean lower low water (MLLW) 1983-2001 Tidal Epoch. MLLW is 5.00 feet below mean sea level (MSL). The FNP through the project area is typically about 150-feet wide, though it narrows at the channel under the General Edwards Bridge. Per guidance for the Army Corps General Permit for Massachusetts “Subsurface utility lines must be installed at a sufficient depth to avoid damage from anchors, dredging, etc., and to prevent exposure from erosion and stream adjustment” and “as an absolute minimum, the bottom cover associated with the initial installation of utility lines under navigable waters and navigation channels shall be 48-inches in soil or 24-inches in rock excavation in competent rock unless specified in a written determination. These minimum bottom cover requirements for pipelines and cables shall be measured from the maximum depth of dredging Figure 26 - Excerpt NOAA Salem & Lynn Harbors to the top of the utility. The maximum depth of Map 13275 dredging, in waterways having existing Corps FNPs, is generally considered to be the authorized project depth plus any allowance for advanced maintenance and the allowable overdepth for dredging tolerances.” Sounding information from the US Army Corps last survey of the Saugus River channel (drawings dated 3/27/2008) suggests the actual depth at the center of the channel is typically 11 to 17 feet below MLLW. Given that actual channel depth, as of last sounding survey, is substantially deeper than the authorized project depth, it is likely that the actual river bottom depth plus water main cover requirements would satisfy the depth required of water main installation. Figure 27 – Excerpt ACOE Map of Saugus River FNP 3-5 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.2.2 Habitats for Species of Concern The project area includes a habitat for a Species of Special Concern and a habitat for a Threatened Species. Figure 28 shows the “Core Habitat Species of Special Concern” data layer from MassGIS. Species of The Species of Special Concern is a bird that roosts in the Special Concern General Edwards Bridge area. The Threatened Species is a bird that occupies the Atlantic-facing barrier beach on the Point of Pines. Threatened Species Figure 28 - Habitat Species of Special Concern MassGIS 3.2.3 ACEC Rumney Marshes Rumney Marsh is located west of the General Edwards Bridge and is an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (“ACEC”). Rumney Marsh is located in the southern portions of the Saugus River watershed. The region was designated by the state as an ACEC in 1988 to preserve its critical environmental value as one of the most biologically significant salt marshes north of Boston. The marsh provides valuable habitat and feeding grounds for a wide variety of fish, shellfish, birds, and mammals. The limit of the Rumney Marsh near the project area is the westerly limit of the railroad bridge crossing right-of-way. Figure 29 – Rumney Marshes ACEC Index Map 3-6 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.2.4 100-Year Flood Plain The Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) published updated Flood Insurance Rate Maps (“FIRM”) in March 2016 for the City of Revere and in July 2014 for the City of Lynn. Most of the area abutting the General Edwards Bridge is within the Special Flood Hazard Area Subject to Inundation by the one percent (1%) Annual Chance Flood. The one percent annual chance event is also commonly referred to as a “100-year event”. This area is indicated in Figures 30 and 31 with a light blue dot overlay. “Zone AE” in the figures indicate that a “Base Flood Elevation” has been determined. “Zone VE” in the Figure 30 - FEMA FIRM Lynn figures indicate a “Coastal flood zone with velocity hazard (wave action)” and that base flood elevation has been determined Figure 31 - FEMA FIRM Revere 3.2.5 Tide Elevation, Tidelands, and Wetlands Tidal datum for Lynn, taken from NOAA Lynn Harbor gage (Station #443187) (NOAA 2016a), establishes mean high water elevation at 4.35’, mean sea level elevation at -0.15’, mean low water elevation at - 4.81’, and mean lower low water elevation at -5.15’, all per North American Vertical Datum of 1988. The “Lynn Coastal Resiliency Assessment”, prepared by Weston & Sampson for the City of Lynn Economic Development and Industrial Corporation, dated July 2016, indicates an estimated sea level rise of 0.75 feet by 2041 and 1.86 feet by 2066, per NOAA Intermediate High method. MassDEP defines “Flowed Tidelands” as lands that are in, on, over, and under tidal waters seaward of the current mean high tide line. This jurisdiction extends seaward to the Commonwealth's 3-mile limit of territorial jurisdiction. Chapter 91 Authorization is required for the placement of any structure or activity located seaward and within 3 miles from the current mean high tide line. MassDEP defines “Filled Tidelands” as former submerged lands and tidal flats which are no longer subject to tidal action due to the presence of fill. Chapter 91 authorization is required for activities on filled tidelands if located in: (a) Designated Port Areas; or (b) between the first public way and the present mean high shoreline, or between 250 feet and the shore, whichever is further from the water. 3-7 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Flowed tidelands exist throughout the project area seaward of the high tide line. Filled tidelands and filled wetlands exist on the Lynn shoreline east and west of the General Edwards Bridge, as described in Section 3.4.2, as well on the Revere shoreline west of the General Edwards Bridge. The substantial change in shoreline and wetlands limits are highlighted in comparison of Figure 32, an early 1900s topographic map, and Figure 32, a current MassGIS rendering. MassDEP designated wetlands in the project area include salt marsh, tidal flats, coastal beaches, and coastal dunes. The MassGIS Chapter 91 jurisdictional limit is presented in Appendix D “Route Alternatives Over Existing Conditions Plan”. Chapter 91 Licenses near the project area were acquired by the MWRA and reviewed by the project team. Licenses secured are listed in Appendix A as references #59 to Figure 32 - Historic Topographic Map #65. Salt Marsh Mouth of River Tidal Flat Barrier Beach – Coastal Beach Barrier Beach – Coastal Dune Figure 33 – DEP Wetlands MassGIS 3-8 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.2.6 Other Areas The project area is not within a Designated Port Area. The DEP Wetlands Program delineates the Mouth of River as shown in Figure 33. This feasibility study did not include a complete environmental assessment nor delineation of resource areas. It is assumed a complete assessment and delineation will be performed in Preliminary Design prior to preparation of notices and permitting may be thoroughly informed. 3.3 Subsurface Conditions Weston & Sampson reviewed available “historical” records of subsurface conditions near the Project site. Most of the records were test boring logs provided to Weston & Sampson by the MWRA from their files. Weston & Sampson added logs of explorations conducted near the project area from previous Weston & Sampson projects in the area. The purpose of reviewing and presenting a discussion of historical exploration data was to provide the project team with a generalized understanding of subsurface conditions appropriate for a feasibility study. The information contained herein should not be interpreted as an engineering analysis of subsurface conditions for project design. 3.3.1 Historic Exploration Data The historical exploration data were collected at different times, by a variety of exploration contractors using different exploration equipment and methods. No engineering reports were available to describe how the data were collected. Weston & Sampson was not involved in collecting the majority of the information. Under these conditions, it is our opinion that placing strong emphasis on quantitative comparisons of these data sets is not appropriate and could be misleading. For example, “blow counts” shown on test borings logs may or may not represent standard penetration testing. Accordingly, we have purposely left out discussion of available blow count data from the explorations since we cannot verify that the information is indicative of SPT N-values. Another issue is lack of information on elevation datum on the logs, which suggests caution when comparing the test boring data in subsurface profiles. Nonetheless, the information is considered suitable for supporting a generalized qualitative discussion of subsurface conditions for this feasibility study. Based on initial review of the available exploration logs listed below, the project alignment can be divided into the North Bank Area (Lynn Side), the River Channel Area, and the South Bank Area (Revere Side). Explorations have been categorized according to the year drilled and the area they represent. A brief description of the explorations and sources of information are provided below. A figure indicating approximate locations of referenced borings, and the attached logs for more detailed information, are attached in Appendix E. 1934 Borings (River Channel Area) A total of 32 test borings labeled #1 through #32 were drilled for design of the existing General Edwards bridge pier foundations. The boring logs are presented in the form of a hand-drafted subsurface profile on the drawing titled “Location of Borings,” Sheet 4 of 50 Sheets, dated September 25, 1934, prepared by J.R. Worcester & Co. These borings were drilled in the Saugus River to between El. -40 and El. -118 (Mean Low Water Datum). Note that these borings were referenced on the September 1967 drawings titled “Proposed Fishing Pier at General Edwards Bridge, Revere, “Site Plan,” (Sheet 1 of 5 Sheets). No additional borings were drilled for the 1967 project. 3-9 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 1954 Borings (North Bank Area) Three test borings labeled Boring No. 1, 2 and 37 were drilled near the north end of the General Edwards Bridge for design of the Lynnway highway construction project in 1954. The boring locations and logs are included on Sheets 49, 50 and 51 of 51 Sheets titled “Lynnway,” dated March 1, 1954 prepared by Edwards, Kelcey and Beck Consulting Engineers. The borings were drilled to between approximately 22 ft. to 35 ft. below ground surface (bgs). Ground surface elevations are listed on the logs but the elevation datum is not indicated. 1970 Borings (South Bank Area) Twelve test borings labeled No. 21 through No. 32 were drilled for design and construction of Route 1- A in Revere. The borings were drilled for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Public Works project titled “State Highway in the City of Revere, Suffolk County, Federal Aid Project U.S. – 153(3),” dated 1970. Boring locations and logs are included on project drawings labeled Sheets 2 and 3 of 63 Sheets titled “Key Plan & Boring Locations” and “Boring Data,” respectively. The borings were drilled by New England Test Boring Corp. to depths between approximately 10.4 ft. and 125.5 ft. bgs. Elevations are listed on the logs but the elevation datum is not indicated. 1973 Borings (River Channel Area) Four test borings labeled B-1 through B-4 were drilled for design of a Fishing Pier east of the General Edwards Bridge extending south into the Saugus River from the timber bulkhead on the Lynn side of the river. Boring locations and logs are included on Sheets 1 and 7 of 7 Sheets titled, “Proposed Fishing Pier Near General Edwards Bridge, Lynn,” dated May 1973, prepared by Brask & Standley Engineering Company. The borings were drilled to between approximately 30 ft. to 60 ft. below mudline at the boring locations in the Saugus River. No information was provided on ground surface elevations at the boring locations. However, soundings data shown on Sheet 2 of 7 of the drawing set indicates most boring locations were within a few feet of Mean Low Water. 1983 Borings (North Bank Area) Nine borings labeled #1 through #9 were drilled near the north end of the General Edwards Bridge for the roadway rehabilitation of the Lynnway. The boring locations and logs are included on Sheets 3 and 4 of 288 Sheets titled, “Rehabilitation of the Lynnway-Carroll Highway,” dated May 4, 1988 (5 years after the borings were drilled) prepared by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Metropolitan District Commission, Parks Engineering and Construction Division. The borings were drilled by Carr-Dee Test Boring and Construction Company in October 1983 to between approximately 3.5 ft. to 5 ft. bgs., apparently for evaluating pavement subgrade conditions, only. Ground surface elevations shown on the logs are referenced to the U.S.C.&G.S. Mean Sea Level Datum of 1929, which is the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 2011 Borings (North Bank Area) Four borings labeled B-1 through B-4 were drilled for the renovations to the Pride Motor Group Kia Dealership located at 793 Lynnway, north of the General Edwards Bridge. The boring locations and logs are included in a report prepared by Weston & Sampson Engineers, “Geotechnical Engineering Report: Proposed Renovations to the Pride Motor Group Kia Dealership,” dated March 3, 2011. The borings were drilled by Crawford Drilling Services, LLC to depths between 37 ft. and 47 ft. bgs. The elevation datum is not indicated on the test boring logs. 3-10 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.3.2 Generalized Subsurface Conditions Generalized characteristics of subsurface conditions for the River Channel Area, North Bank Area and South Bank Area based on available subsurface information are described below. Refer to Appendix E for approximate locations of borings and the attached logs for more detailed information at specific locations. River Channel Area Based on the 1934 borings, the generalized soil profile of the River Channel Area from the mudline downward consists of approximately 5 to 20 ft. of silty SAND with varying organic content overlying approximately 30 ft. to 95 ft. of medium stiff to soft blue CLAY. The clay stratum is underlain by what appears to be dense GLACIAL TILL (sand, gravel and clay described on the logs as “hardpan”). The hardpan is typically identified in the bottom 3 ft. to 5 ft. of each boring. The upper silty SAND layer is typically 5 ft. to 10 ft. thick in borings #13 through #24 located in approximately the southern half of the river channel. The upper silty SAND was typically 5 ft. to 20 ft. thick in borings #1 through #12 located in approximately the northern half of the river channel with layer thicknesses generally increasing closer to the northern shore. Borings #1 through #5, which are near the northern shore, also encountered between approximately 2 ft. and 10 ft. of peat and organic silt underlying the upper silty SAND layer. The CLAY stratum appears to have an approximately 5 ft. to 10 ft. thick “medium blue clay” upper layer with the underlying material generally described as soft. The CLAY stratum thickness appears greatest in the northern half of the river channel with thicknesses ranging from approximately 85 ft. to 95 ft., whereas the clay thickness decreases from about 90 ft. near the center of the channel to approximately 30 ft. near the southern shore. The 1934 boring logs were presented in the form of a subsurface profile, which is attached to this memorandum. The 1973 borings encountered similar soil conditions as those encountered by the 1934 borings. However, 1973 borings B-1, B-2 and B-3 encountered between 3 ft. and 23 ft. of the upper sand layer, then penetrated into and were terminated in the clay layer between 30 ft. and 60 ft. below mudline. The 1973 boring B-4 encountered approximately 3. 5 ft. of silt and sand overlying stiff clay to about 20 ft. below grade, where the boring encountered very dense sand and gravel (GLACIAL TILL). The general stratum description on the log indicated boulders might be present in the GLACIAL TILL. This boring was terminated at 32 ft. below grade with refusal conditions encountered (100 blows of a 200 lb. hammer on an open end a-rod). North Bank Area Borings in the North Bank Area include the 1954 borings, the 1983 borings and the 2011 borings. The 1983 borings penetrated only 3.5 to 5 ft. below grade so are of limited value to the project. The 1954 borings were drilled in the Lynnway between Hanson Street and the approach ramp to the General Edwards Bridge to depths ranging from 22 ft. to 35 ft., and the 2011 borings were drilled on the Pride Kia property on the west side of the Lynnway across from Hanson Street. Thee data sets provide useful information for understanding the subsurface profile in the North Bank Area. 3-11 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Based on the 1954 and 2011 borings subsurface conditions in the North Bank Area generally consist of between approximately 10 ft. and 16 ft. of loose to medium dense SAND FILL with variable amounts of gravel, silt, cinders, ash and debris including brick fragments and miscellaneous trash. The FILL is also intermixed with and layered with ORGANIC SILT in some locations. The FILL generally overlies a naturally deposited loose to dense SAND containing varying amounts of gravel and silt to between 21 and 31 ft. bgs. Where the SAND is fully penetrated, the underlying stratum can generally be described as medium stiff to very soft CLAY with little silt and trace fine sand to the depths explored (between approximately 35 ft. and 47 ft. below grade). The CLAY consistency generally becomes softer with depth. South Bank Area Based on the 1970 Borings, the subsurface conditions in the South Bank Area consist of approximately 5 ft. to 10 ft. of SAND FILL at the ground surface. The FILL overlies variable thicknesses of naturally deposited loose to dense silty SAND. Where fully penetrated by the borings, the silty SAND extended to between approximately 25 ft. and 50 ft. below ground surface. Thin layers of Organic SILT and PEAT were noted on some of the logs near the bottom of the SAND FILL and within the native silty SAND layer. The silty SAND overlies stiff to soft silty CLAY where the silty SAND layer was fully penetrated by the borings. Where fully penetrated by the borings, the CLAY layer varied from less than 10 ft. thick to over 40 ft. thick and generally has a stiff consistency near the top of the layer, becoming softer with depth. Where the clay was fully penetrated, the underlying soils are generally medium dense to dense SILTY SAND with gravel and boulders (GLACIAL TILL). Test boring 29, which was drilled to approximately 125 ft. below grade, encountered approximately 30 ft. of organic SILT with shells from about 30 to 60 ft. below grade but did not encounter the CLAY layer and went directly into the dense GLACIAL TILL soils. The boring extended through the GLACIAL TILL to approximately 115 ft. below grade where two 5 ft. rock cores were obtained. The logs indicate the rock core recovery was only about 15 to 20 percent in the two core runs. No information was provided to indicate Rock Quality Designations. 3.4 Environmental Records Weston & Sampson obtained existing soil and groundwater data from the Project Area by reviewing available information from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) Reportable Release Database, which includes files detailing the extent of response actions conducted under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP), 310 CMR 40.0000, to address known releases of oil and hazardous materials to the environment. The review identified 14 releases within the Project area. The impacted media, contaminants of concern, completed remedial actions and regulatory status for each release are summarized in tables and figures attached in Appendix F. 3.4.1 Review of Existing MassDEP Records Review identified four reported releases on the Revere side of the Saugus River. In general, these releases were limited to small releases of petroleum products to soil and groundwater and the extent of contamination was relatively limited. While these releases achieved regulatory 3-12 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY closure under the MCP, some residual contamination in soil and groundwater exists; however, based on the data provided in historic reports, contamination is expected to be localized to areas where the releases occurred. A summary of the analytical sampling results and areas of contamination for releases on the Revere side of the Saugus River are provided in Appendix F. Our findings suggest impacted soil is present on the Lynn side of the Saugus River. Several environmental reports listed the Project Area in Lynn as an area filled with dredged sediment and municipal wastes between the 1920s and 1930s. These fill materials may extend up to 12 feet below grade and include coal, coal ash, brick, glass, wood and other debris. Based on our review of the historic reports, fill materials were identified at properties on the eastern and western sides of the Lynnway (see Figure 1 in Appendix F), including the following sites identified by address and release tracking number (RTN): • 671 Lynnway (RTN 3-15603) • 715 The Lynnway (RTN 3-13417) • 770 Lynnway (RTN 3-11033) • 777-793 Lynnway (RTN 3-4663 & 3-24567) • 715 The Lynnway (RTN 3-3329) • Harding Street LC7 (RTN 3-12511) Soil sampling indicates the fill contains concentrations of metals, semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). In addition to historic fill on the Lynn side of the Saugus River, Weston & Sampson notes there are four sites within the Project Area where non- fill related residual contamination may also exist, which has the potential to impact off-property areas. A summary of the conditions for these sites is provided below. A summary of the analytical sampling results and areas of contamination for the most significant reported releases on the Lynn side of the Saugus River are provided in Attachment B. 715 The Lynnway (3-13417) In addition to historic fill containing VOCs, SVOCs, metals and TPH, groundwater at this property was noted to contain concentrations of chlorinated VOCs, including1,2- dichloroethylene (1,2-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). VC concentrations were present at levels up to 2,000 micrograms per liter, well in excess of applicable MCP Method 1 GW-2 standards. Groundwater flow was also noted to flow south from the property towards our selected Project Area. Environmental records for this release noted that remediating the fill or contaminated groundwater was infeasible. To achieve regulatory closure, an Activity and Use Limitation (AUL) was placed on the property to restrict future excavation activities. Based on the existing data and nature of contamination documented at this site, there is the potential for this property to impact future utility construction, depending on the design and route. 3-13 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Mobil Gasoline Station, 700 Lynnway (3-4486) In 1992, faulty underground storage tank (UST) supply lines were identified to have released gasoline to soil and groundwater. The release of gasoline to groundwater resulted in a plume of gasoline constituents on the property. In situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) treatment was performed in 2005 and 2007 to address the dissolved phase groundwater plume; however, groundwater samples collected as recently as 2014 indicated elevated concentrations of volatile petroleum hydrocarbon (VPH) fractions at one location persist above applicable MCP Method 1 GW-2 standards. In 2015, the existing gas station was closed and three 10,000-gallon USTs and associated piping were removed. Following UST removal, impacted soils were excavated and approximately 1,008 tons of petroleum-impacted soils were transported for off-Site recycling. Approximately 32,000 gallons of dewatering fluids were also treated and discharged to the Lynn sewer system during the removal. Based on the site files for this release, the site is currently being evaluated for closure under the MCP but has not achieved regulatory closure. Based on the existing data, age of the release, and nature of contamination documented at this site, potential gasoline-impacted groundwater may have migrated off-Site and impacted down- gradient areas. As such, there is the potential for this release to impact future utility construction, depending on the design and route. 811 Lynnway (3-2326) In 1988, 60 cubic yards (CY) of oil-impacted soil was stockpiled on the Site. These soils were excavated during the removal of two leaking 275 gallon USTs. In 1991, these soils were prepared to be removed from the Site; however, there is no record of actual removal. Our review of the existing documentation suggests the 1988 removal of the leaking USTs may not have been in compliance with applicable MassDEP regulations. In addition, staging of petroleum impacted soils for an extended period of time may have results in impacts to soils and groundwater, which have not been evaluated. It is possible that petroleum impacts are still present at this property and could impact future utility construction depending on the final design route. 671 Lynnway (3-15603) Historic investigation of this site identified VOCs, SVOCs, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), metals, and TPH impacts in soil and groundwater. These contaminants were attributed to two sources of contamination: the historic fill prevalent in the area and historic releases of petroleum from historic aboveground and underground storage tanks. Petroleum impacts to soil and groundwater were discovered in the 1992 from the release of waste oil from an aboveground storage tank (AST) and in 1998 during the decommissioning of six USTs. Site file indicate the property also has a history as a railroad bed prior to 1880, which may be a contributing source of contamination to this site and surrounding area. An AUL was filed for the property in 2002 and requires the maintenance of asphalt barrier to prevent exposure to impacted soils/fill at this property. As residual impacts to soil and 3-14 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY groundwater remain, there is the potential for this property to impact the Project, depending on the final design and route. 3.4.2 Filled Lands and Unknown Contamination As noted above, the southeastern extent of Lynn was reportedly filled with dredged sediment and municipal wastes between 1920s and 1930s. In addition to metals, VOCs, SVOCs, PCBs and petroleum hydrocarbons, historic fill from the 1920 and 1930s was not analyzed for but may have included asbestos waste. Weston & Sampson also notes our review of existing soil and groundwater data is based on review of MassDEP records for sites where there have been known releases of oil and/or hazardous materials to environment. Given the proximity of the Project Area to industrial and commercial facilities, including the General Electric (GE) Aircraft Engines manufacturing plant and historic railroad operations, unknown sources of contamination may exist with the potential for additional sources of contamination, such as petroleum impacts and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are often associated with industrial/commercial and railroad activities. 3.4.3 Conclusions The information indicates historic fill is present on the Lynn side of the Saugus River. Fill is heterogeneous and historic analysis indicates it is impacted with VOCs, SVOCs, metals and TPH. The fill also included dredged sediment and municipal wastes which may have been contaminated when placed in the 1920 and 1930s. These historic fill materials were not identified on the Revere side of the Project area. In addition to historic fill, review identified potential soil and groundwater contamination from non-fill related sources, including several releases of petroleum on both the Lynn and Revere side of Saugus River and a release of chlorinated VOCs to groundwater in Lynn. Limited delineation for some of these reported releases indicates there is a potential for contamination in the Project area to impact future utility construction depending on design and location. 3.5 Stakeholders and Abutters 3.5.1 City of Lynn The northern limit of the Section 56 crossing of the Saugus River is in the City of Lynn. The City of Lynn owns local streets in the project area, including Hanson Street, a local street connecting the Lynnway to the Lynn Harbor shoreline northeast of the General Edwards Bridge. The City of Lynn considers the area east of the General Edwards Bridge (through the roundabout to Nahant) to be part of a strategic Lynn Municipal Harbor area in which they wish to promote bettered land use for the community. The interests of the City in in the area are summarized as follows (from September 2010 Municipal Harbor Plan by Sasaki): • “enhance the physical and visual connection of the larger City with its waterfront • create a unified series of public spaces along a waterfront promenade 3-15 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY • create a landmark open space within the waterfront for the staging community events and celebrations • create a mixed-use neighborhood designed to maximizes the benefits to be derived from its unique waterfront location (e.g., views and water/land interface) • ensure that the future development of the waterfront functions as an extension of, rather than a departure from, the City's existing urban fabric • configure and align development blocks so as to promote energy conservation though the siting of buildings • expand the range of transportation options available to residents through the introduction of a water-based option • coordinate the goals of the City to promote the beneficial development of its waterfront with the goals and policies of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to protect the interests of all Commonwealth citizens with regard to the use of public trust lands (i.e., tidelands)” Figure 34 - Lynn Harbor Planning Area from MHP The vision for land use was reconciled into a Lynn Municipal Harbor Plan (“MHP”) which was approved by the Commonwealth’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs in 2010. The limits of the MHP area is shown in Figure 34. The MHP provided an opportunity for local and state agencies to reconcile vision and streamline approvals and permitting required for desired land development, as summarized below (from September 2010 Municipal Harbor Plan by Sasaki): • “Enhance the responsiveness of Commonwealth agency actions to the city's land use goals and objectives, harbor conditions, and circumstances; • Ensure that tidelands licensing actions pursuant to the provisions of M.G.L.c. 91 on individual properties and projects are taken in the context of the city's objectives and goals for the development of the larger waterfront area; and • Establish development and design standards specifically tailored to respond to the conditions of Lynn Harbor and the city's objectives and goals as substitutes for the general, state-wide standards specified at 310 CMR 9.00.” The area to the east of the General Edwards Bridge is referred to as the “Gateway Zone”, as described below and conceptually rendered in Figure 35. Water main replacement in the General Edwards Bridge 3-16 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY area should proceed understanding the City of Lynn’s interest for future development in the area high aesthetic quality and incorporating recreational spaces near the waterfront. “The Gateway Zone extends from the General Edwards Bridge at the southwest end of the Harbor Planning Area northeast to the Carolyn Road/Lynnway intersection. As the gateway to the City from points to the south, it is vital to the future of the City that the development of this area be of high aesthetic quality. To ensure that private interests will be able to derive sufficient financial returns to establish and maintain the desired quality, land uses must be of high inherent value and developed at relatively high densities. Accordingly, the Gateway Zone is envisioned to be a mixed- use neighborhood containing a variety of housing types, block configurations, and price ranges, with supporting retail, restaurants, and some office space. The majority of the office space would be located along the Lynnway, with residential buildings making up the rest of the district. Ground floor retail would be encouraged along the Lynnway, the waterfront, and other primary streets within this zone. Restaurants would be oriented towards the water to capitalize on views of the ocean, Nahant, and the Boston skyline. A typical block within this zone would have lower-rise residential building massing along the waterfront, transitioning to high-rise massing in the middle of the zone, so as to maximize waterfront views for each development. Structured parking would be internal to the block and could be created with a green roof or encouraged to support activities to lessen the heat island effect and create a more pleasing view for the residents. The \"water-dependent use zone\", as defined in the Massachusetts Waterways Regulations at 310 CMR 9.51(3)(c), within the Gateway Zone is to be reserved for such water-dependent uses as recreational marinas and a public pedestrian promenade. The marina envisioned for the mouth of the Saugus River is to incorporate the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation's existing public fishing pier, taking it out of isolation and enhancing its value to the public. The marina along the shore of the inner harbor will be created by excavating and removing part of the municipal landfill and re-establishing a watersheet in this area of filled tidelands. The pedestrian promenade along the harbor edge in the Gateway Zone is envisioned to be part of an expanded park space extending at least 200 feet inland from the water's edge.” Figure 35 - Conceptual Rendering Gateway Zone from MHP The MWRA and Weston & Sampson met with the Economic Development & Industrial Corporation of Lynn (“EDIC”) in September 2016 and the Lynn Water & Sewer Commission (“LWSC”) in October 2016 to discuss the Project and interests in the work area. Meeting minutes from each conference are attached in Appendix G. The EDIC shared their understanding of development history and status in the work area, and the LWSC shared the nature of existing and proposed utility systems in the area. The City of Lynn shared that a combined sewer overflow (“CSO”) outfall may be planned in the area to support ongoing combined sewer separation. The team identified that the nearest location of a 3-17 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY proposed outfall was north of Hanson Street, and should not impact the project. The City of Lynn does maintain water main in Hanson Street nearest to the Lynnway (dead ends), in the Lynnway, and in an easement in DCR property east of the Lynnway. 3.5.2 City of Revere The southern limit of the Section 56 crossing of the Saugus River is in the City of Revere. The City of Revere owns and maintains local streets in the project area, including Rice Avenue, Whitin Avenue, Fowler Avenue, Bateman Avenue, Witherbee Avenue, Wadsworth Avenue, and others, in the Point of Pines area. The City maintains water, sewer, and stormwater collection infrastructure in the work area, as depicted in the three figures on this page. Figure 36 – City of Revere GIS, Rice Avenue at the The MWRA and Weston & Sampson met with the City Lynnway Engineer for the City of Revere in September 2016 to discuss the Project and interests in the work area. Meeting minutes from each conference are attached in Appendix G. The City Engineer shared existing utility information including GIS exports and design plans for an existing City of Revere Stormwater Pump Station. The Pump Station exists adjacent to the Point of Pines Yacht Club. The team discussed the public park with playing fields, Gibson Park, which is located to the west of the General Edwards Bridge, as shown in the “Route Alternatives of Existing Conditions Plan”, attached in Appendix D. 3.5.3 Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation The DCR maintains the Lynnway in Lynn and Revere, the Lynn Fishing Pier, and various parcels abutting the Lynnway to the East. Figure 37 – City of Revere GIS, Rice The DCR owns easements to the Lynn Fishing Pier from the Avenue at Bateman Avenue Lynnway. DCR owns a 54” drain in the parcels east of the Lynnway which conveys stormwater from the Lynnway to the Saugus River immediately east of the General Edwards Bridge. The Lynn Fishing Pier, DCR parcels, and drains are shown in the “Route Alternatives of Existing Conditions Plan”, attached in Appendix D. 3.5.4 Massachusetts Department of Transportation MassDOT operates and maintains the General Edwards Bridge and North Shore Drive in Revere. South of the Bridge, MassDOT owns ramps connecting North Shore Road (State Route 1A) to the Lynnway in Revere. The General Edwards Bridge is described in Section 2 and Section 3.1.1. Figure 38 – City of Revere GIS, Rice Avenue at End of Point of Pines 3-18 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.5.5 Proposed Development West of the General Edwards Bridge A private developer, Lynnway Associates LLC proposes to redevelop the former General Electric (“GE”) Gearworks site in Lynn. The project is described in a November 16, 2015 draft Environmental Notification Form (“ENF”) as follows: “The project is located on a ±77 acre parcel along the westerly side of the Lynnway (Route 1A) just north of the Saugus River. A 65.5 acre portion of the parcel was purchased by the Proponent for the development of a transit-oriented, residential development project with mixed-use accessory services. The remaining 11.5 acre portion of the parcel will be retained by GE and currently houses an outlying utility building and jet fuel storage tanks, utilized by the adjacent Riverworks plant. The site was previously part of Figure 39 - Lynn Gearworks Redevelopment Conceptual property owned by GE, along with Rendering October 2016 the adjacent Riverworks plant to the west, and at its peak in 1942 contained a 500,000 SF Navy gear plant with over 15,000 employees working in multiple shifts. Due to a decline in gear orders, GE sold its non-nuclear gear product line in 2009 and the Gearworks plant was closed and demolished in 2011. The proposed project is a transit-oriented residential development (TOD), which includes the construction of 1,250 residential units and a mix of ancillary retail, restaurant, and other supporting uses. In addition to the seven residential buildings, the project will include several supporting amenity buildings for use by the residents, including a 10,550 SF clubhouse, a 28,800 SF sports club, a 10,200 SF leasing / management office, and approximately 16,000 SF of complementary retail space to offer on-site service to the TOD residents, without requiring off-site trip making. Access to the site is currently provided via a signalized, full-access/egress driveway along the Lynnway (Route 1A) at the northerly end of the site, known as 19th Street. As part of the project, a secondary full-access/egress driveway is proposed at the southerly end of the site, connecting to the Lynnway (Route 1A) opposite the existing Jughandle, which will provide public access to the waterfront along Rumney Marsh and the Saugus River.” The final EIR was submitted in March 2017. Per discussion with Lynn EDIC, the project was to begin near the end of 2017. The Project is expected to be built in five phases. The final phase is scheduled for completion in 2022. 3.5.6 Proposed Development East of General Edwards Bridge In a September 2016 meeting, Lynn EDIC shared that a development is proposed on parcel 34-760-7 which includes approximately 250 units. This parcel abuts the Lynnway east of the General Edwards Bridge between the waterfront parcel and the Lynnway Mart. The proposed building layout will be on top of an existing foundation associated with a historic building on-site, “Club Morgan”. EDIC estimated 3-19 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY construction might start in the second half of 2016 and conclude in approximately 24-months. EDIC recalled that subsequent phases of development has been discussed, perhaps extending to waterfront parcel 34-752-77, but that planning has not been initiated. Each of these parcels are shown in the “Route Alternatives of Existing Conditions Plan”, attached in Appendix D. EDIC recalls that the property owner’s name is Joseph O’Donnell and his development partner may be Priderock Capital Partners LLC. 3.5.7 Point of Pines Area Revere The Point of Pines area in the City of Revere exists to the southeast of the General Edwards Bridge. This dense residential neighborhood is generally comprised of single family homes occupied year-round. The neighborhood is accessed from the Lynnway to the west. Rice Avenue provides bi-directional access to the shoreline. Local streets between Rice Avenue and the Lynnway are generally one-way and provide for on-street parking. Figure 40 – Orthophoto Point of Pines Area An organization called the Point of Pines Beach Association owns lands between Rice Avenue and the Mean Low Water Line. Residents of the Point of Pines neighborhood comprise the membership of the Point of Pines Beach Association. Per the Constitution and Bylaws of the Point of Pines Beach Association: “The purposes of this corporation shall be to hold certain property known as the Point of Pines Beach as described in a certain deed recorded with the Suffolk County Registry of Deeds, Book Number 6505, Page Number 356; to establish and maintain a place for holding meetings; to encourage friendly feeling among it's members; to promote the civic and social well being of those owning and interested in real estate in the Point of Pines section of Revere; to promote and encourage civic activities, especially in respect to the control and maintenance of the community beach, and in connection therewith to acquire, hold, use, encumber, and dispose of any real and personal property and any rights and privileges which the corporation may think necessary and convenient for it's purposes; and to do any and all things permissible under Chapter 180 of the General Laws.” A Point of Pines Yacht Club (the “Yacht Club”) exists to the east of the General Edwards Bridge and houses the seasonal moorings referenced previously. The Yacht Club has a parking lot abutting the shore that has access to Rice Avenue. The Yacht Club owns land to mean low water behind their property. 3-20 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.5.8 Commercial Abutters Various commercial premises exist in Lynn abutting the Lynnway to the west. The Lynnway Mart and Walmart exist between the Lynn Harbor shoreline and the Lynnway. In Revere, various commercial premises exist between the State Route 1A exit ramp and the Saugus River. Figure 41 - Orthophoto Commercial Abutters Southwest of Bridge Figure 42 - Orthophoto Commercial Abutters North of the Bridge O:\\MWRA\\2150821-Bridge Crossing FS\\C7500 File\\13 Subtasks\\3.3 Final Feasibility Study\\Feasibility Study Final Report.docx 3-21 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 4.0 RIVER CROSSING METHODS Open trench, mircotunneling and horizontal directional drilling (HDD) pipe installation methods were reviewed alongside removal and replacement on bridge. 4.1 Open Trench Marine pipeline installation across a navigable waterway via open trench dredging and pipe installation is typically conducted from barges. In typical installations, a trench is dredged to a depth sufficient for pipe installation and backfilling. The pipeline is lowered into place and the trench is typically backfilled with excavated soil. In some cases, a protective barrier such as a segmental concrete anchoring mat is placed over the backfilled pipe to reduce the risk of damage to the pipe by navigation operations. The depth and method of trench excavation is generally selected based on factors such as project size, characteristics of river bottom sediments and soils, range of water depth, and current. Softer or looser materials (generally associated with mild currents) tend to require greater excavation depths than stiffer or denser materials. The generalized soil profile of the Saugus River channel consists of several feet of organic (or marine) silty sand overlying up to 95 ft. of medium stiff to very soft blue clay. Glacial till and bedrock are present below the clay. The consistency of the clay is generally medium stiff near the top and becomes softer with depth. The materials to be dredged will depend on the final alignment and US Army Corps of Engineers depth of cover requirements. Hydraulic dredging and mechanical dredging/excavation are likely the most appropriate methods for this project. Use of a cofferdam is not viewed as practical at this site due to crossing-length, depth of channel, the navigable waterway, and tidal influence. Figure 43 shows an environmental clamshell bucket attached to an excavator supported on a platform barge in the foreground and a crane supported on a barge in the background. The excavator is suitable for relatively shallow excavation. A clamshell suspended from a crane can be used Figure 43 - Clamshell Bucket on Excavator where water depth and required excavation depth exceed the reach of a mechanical excavator. To ensure quality control during trenching, divers are typically employed with hydrographic scanners or sonar to verify trench depth and width. Trench spoil material can be stored on the river bottom adjacent to the trench if currents will allow this without undue sediment transport. Alternatively, trench spoils can be stored on the barge or transported to shore. Mechanical dredging can result in significant quantities of suspended sediments, which is particularly undesirable if there is a risk of environmental contamination along the pipeline alignment. 4-1 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Figure 44 - Hydraulic Dredge For softer bottom soil conditions and where sediment transport is a concern, methods such as hydraulic dredging can be used to limit sediment suspension and loss. The adjacent image illustrates a hydraulic dredging operation. Material to be dredged is essentially vacuumed from the channel bottom. There can be a tool or cutterhead at the intake end of the suction line to loosen the material to be dredged. The suction line then vacuums and transports the loosened material up to the barge for storage or upland Figure 45 - Barge disposal. Once the trench is excavated to the required depth, the pipeline is assembled and lowered into place from an installation barge as illustrated in the adjacent image. Pipe installed by this method can be High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Steel, Fiberglass Reinforced (FR), or Ductile Iron (DI) with flexible joints such as the Flex-Loc manufactured by American Cast Iron Pipe Company. Figure 46 - Floats Anchor collars can be added to the pipe to aid in installation and help control flotation and movement in the trench. Once the pipe is tested and placed in the trench, the trench is backfilled with the excavated material and/or imported gravel fill. Protective segmental concrete mats can be placed over all or part of the pipe for additional Figure 47 - Concrete Mats protection. 4.2 Microtunnel Microtunneling is a pipe jacking process that employs a remotely controlled, closed face tunneling shield, also commonly referred to as a Microtunnel Boring Machine (MTBM). Closed face earth pressure balanced or slurry pressure balanced shields are capable of exerting a positive pressure against the 4-2 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY excavation face to maintain face stability and prevent ground and groundwater inflow into the pipe during construction. Routine personnel entry of the pipe being jacked is not required for microtunneling. The pipe diameter range for microtunneling is generally from 10 to 136 inches, however the most common pipe diameter range for microtunneling is between 24 to 48 inches. The primary advantages of microtunneling are that the product pipe can be directly installed in a smaller ground opening and the depth of the tunnel can be adapted to the subsurface conditions. Direct installation of the product pipe by microtunneling tends to reduce the risk of loss of ground and surface settlement compared to horizontal directional drilling methods for similar sized pipe. If necessary, the vertical grade of the pipe can be lowered (deeper jacking and receiving shafts required) to avoid poor ground conditions identified along the alignment. Considerations for microtunneling pipe selection and cutter head design include soil type, strength, consistency, potential for encountering Figure 48 - Typical Microtunnel Operation obstructions and groundwater levels. Subsurface explorations along the microtunnel alignment and material laboratory testing are required to identify the design parameters. Portions of the river crossing alignments are expected to encounter soft clay soils, which can cause difficulty maintaining line and grade. The risks associated with controlling line and grade can be minimized by utilizing microtunneling equipment and pipe adaptable to the anticipated ground conditions. Utility installation using microtunneling can be executed as a one-pipe or two-pipe system. In a one- pipe system, the pipe installed via microtunneling is the final “product”, or “carrier”, pipe. In a two-pipe system, a “casing” pipe is installed via microtunnel, then a “carrier” or “product” pipe is sliplined into the casing pipe. Spacers are typically used to slipline the carrier pipe followed by backfilling the annulus space. A two-pipe system will likely to be required at this crossing. Staging Areas Staging areas are required at each end of the microtunnel reach: a jacking shaft at one end and a receiving shaft at the other end. The jacking shaft is of more substantial design consequence as this is where most of the work takes place. The adjacent image is a schematic illustration of a jacking shaft staging area. The staging area needs to be large enough to accommodate pipe delivery, storage and handling, a control cabin for guiding the MTBM, muck handling, temporary storage and disposal, shaft ventilation systems and other support equipment. The staging area configuration can be modified to accommodate available space and existing surface features and land use. The receiving shaft is generally smaller and sized to allow the tunneling shield to be lifted out by crane after tunneling is complete. 4-3 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY A typical jacking shaft staging area might require a space 18 to 24 ft. wide by 75 to 100 ft. long including space for a 10 to 15 ft. wide by 15 to 25 ft. long jacking shaft. Shaft depth is determined by a variety of factors including anticipated soil and groundwater conditions, installation length, depth of cover and other factors. The lateral limits of the jacking shaft are selected to accommodate a reaction wall for the retractable hydraulic jacks, the excavation support system for the sidewalls and floor of the shaft, and the equipment and personnel needed in the shaft during tunneling. Intermediate Jacking Stations Dependent on ground conditions, pipe diameter, type of equipment used and crew experience, microtunneling drive lengths up to about 1,500 feet are feasible without the need for intermediate jacking stations (IJS). An IJS is a fabricated steel cylinder fitted with hydraulic jacks, which is incorporated into a pipeline between two specially fabricated pipe segments (see adjacent image for a typical assembly). Its function is to provide additional thrust in order to overcome skin friction and distribute the jacking forces over the pipe. IJSs are utilized when jacking forces exceed the capacity of the main jacks, the maximum allowable stress on the pipe or thrust block reaction load in the jacking shaft. Upon completion of the microtunneling drive, the operational components of the IJS are removed by personnel entry thereby allowing pipe string closure. Microtunneling standards Figure 49 - Intermediate Jacking recommend a minimum casing ID size of 39 inches if an IJS is used for Station construction. Of note is that OSHA confined space entry requirements will need to be adhered to. The use of an IJS is assumed as risk mitigation measure in this feasibility study given the microtunnel installation length and the limited ground conditions information. 4.3 Horizontal Directional Drill HDD is a pipe installation method that involves drilling a guided borehole, referred to as the pilot hole, through the ground along a predetermined path from an entry point to an exit point. For larger pipes, a small diameter pilot hole is drilled, and then enlarged by one or more passes of a reamer to a diameter typically about 1.5 times the finished pipe diameter. Throughout the pilot hole, drilling, and reaming process soil cuttings are removed from the borehole and borehole stability is maintained by a continually circulated drilling fluid (typically bentonite slurry). A variety of pipe materials can be installed using HDD methods, including steel, HDPE and PVC pipe. The pipe is assembled by fusing/welding pipe sections to form a continuous pipe of a length sufficient to span the distance from the entry point to the exit point. The pipe integrity is tested and the pipe is pulled back through the borehole in one continuous operation, if practical, to limit the risk of the pipe becoming stuck during pullback. The pipe can be assembled in segments and welded/fused in the field during pull back, but at an elevated risk of the pipe becoming stuck in the borehole and/or increased pull time and damage to the pipe. The Figure 50 illustrates the sequence of HDD. 4-4 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Figure 50 - Typical HDD Operation An advantage of HDD is its steering capability. Gradual changes in horizontal and vertical alignment can be accommodated. The maximum radius of curvature is dependent on the diameter and material of the pipe. For steel pipe, the typical allowable maximum radius of curvature in feet is 100 times the diameter of pipe in inches. Multiple changes in alignment and shorter-radius changes increase the risk of the pipe becoming stuck during pullback and/or damage to the pipe during installation. However, if an obstruction is encountered during pilot hole construction, the drill head can be pulled back and guided around the obstacle during pilot hole drilling, provided the change in alignment will not adversely impact pipeline pullback. Portions of the river crossing alignments are expected to encounter soft clay soils, which could cause steering difficulties. The risk associated with steering can be mitigated during design, and by utilizing appropriate steering heads during construction. HDD systems are typically launched from the ground surface so no jacking or receiving shafts are required. Therefore, the setup time is shorter compared to that of a microtunneling operation. Excavated materials, or “cuttings”, are suspended in the circulated drilling slurry. Slurry laden with excavated soil is passed through centrifuge desanding units to separate soil from the slurry before re-circulation. In general, there is less excavated material to manage with HDD compared to other trenchless methods. 4-5 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Bore entry and exit distance from the river will be a function of available space and site constraints (seawall, piles). “Starter casings” are optional driven casings which can be installed at the HDD entry and exit locations to limit risk of hydrofracture, if cover or fluid loss are a concern, and provide advantage by isolating soils near the surface, if contamination is a concern. HDD pipe installation may include a single carrier/product pipe, or a two-pipe carrier/product pipe and casing pipe system. Either option can include addition of a starter casing. In a single pipe installation the carrier pipe is designed to provide strength sufficient to withstand pulling forces and abrasion incurred during installation. A two pipe system will include carrier pipe, casing pipe, spacers, and backfill material in the annular space. A two pipe system is substantially more expensive. Expense is a result of adding a second pipe, spacers, fill, and labor, but also as it upsizes all aspects of the HDD operations. A larger reamed hole requires larger equipment, greater volume drilling fluids, greater volume spoils for disposal, and greater risk of release of drilling fluids due to pressure required to maintain a larger bore diameter. Staging Areas Staging areas are required on both ends of the HDD reach. Space requirements for each staging area depend on the phase of the work being conducted and the size of the drill rig. During drilling of the pilot hole most activity occurs at the location of the drill rig. The rig size required for HDD drilling is based on the following criteria: Size of HDD rig Pipe Size Range Depth of Pipe Range Bore Length Range Mini-HDD 2 in. to 25 in. Less than 30 ft. Less than 600 ft. Midi-HDD 12 in. to 25 in. 30 ft. to 75 ft. 600 ft. to 900 ft. Maxi-HDD 26 in. to 60 in. 75 ft. to 200 ft. Up to 10,000 ft. Table 2 – Rig Size Based on HDD Characteristics Anticipated bore lengths for the potential HDD alignments discussed below range from about 1,600 ft. to over 3,000 ft. Based on anticipated bore lengths and associated depth of pipe cover, it appears likely that maxi-HDD rig is most appropriate for the project. The staging area at the bore entry would likely be approximately 150 ft. by 250 ft. while a much smaller staging would be required at the pilot hole exit location. During reaming operations, an approximately 25 ft. by 50 ft. staging area might be required at the exit location to allow tools to be changed and for access by a vac-truck used to recover drilling fluid that may discharge from the bore exit. The following images illustrate typical entry and exit staging areas for HDD operations. 4-6 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Figure 51 - Typical Bore Entry Staging Figure 52 - Typical Pipe Side Staging The required staging area during HDD pull-back operations is a long linear right-of-way large enough to allow make-up of the entire length of pipe to be pulled into the bore. The pull-back staging area is usually at the bore exit, but can be at either end of the alignment depending on space limitations. If pull-back is performed on the bore entry side of the drill operation, the drill rig will need to be relocated from the bore entry side to the bore exit side prior to pipe pullback. The staging area should be in the range of the total 4-7 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY pipe length plus approximately 100 feet with an approximately 25 foot wide right-of-way. It appears that there is ample room on the Lynn side of project for pull-back staging. There are also opportunities for pull-back staging on the Revere side of the alignments. There are certain geometric constraints that impact selection of entry and exit point locations and associated staging areas. Considerations for minimum and maximum bore entry and exit angles, minimum radius of curvature for the bore and minimum depth of cover must be considered when selecting the minimum distance between pilot hole entry and exit points and, in turn, minimum distance between staging areas. Typically the entry and exit angles should be in the range of 8 to 12 degrees such that the pipe does not require lifting above approximately 12 feet for entry into the bore. Typical allowable maximum radius of curvature (in feet) for steel pipe is 100 times the nominal pipe diameter (in inches). Inadvertent Return of Drilling Fluids to the Environment Inadvertent return of drilling fluids to the environment is a risk of trenchless installation methods which use drilling fluids. Inadvertent return of drilling fluid to the environment may be characterized as a “frac out” or a “hydrofracture”. “Frac out” refers to an event where drilling fluid is released during drilling through a preferential seepage path along piers, piles, loose gravel, rocks or improperly backfilled test borings. “Hydrofracture” refers to an event where drilling fluid pressure overcomes the overburden pressure to release into the environment. Risk of release can be mitigated through appropriate subsurface exploration, design requirements, and construction methods. Subsurface investigations should be performed to identify a detailed soil bottom profile and characterize the physical properties of soils above and near the drill path. The design cover depth specified should be appropriate for anticipated drilling fluid pressure and subsurface conditions. An example depth of cover for this crossing might be around 30-feet. Requiring a starter casing at entry and exit locations can reduce risks of release in the shallowest portion of the HDD pipe installation. Drilling fluids will be designed based on the soil characteristics indicated in subsurface explorations. The contractor should have a contingency plan and be prepared to mitigate risk in the event of a release. Mitigating risk would include monitoring drilling fluids and adjusting chemical makeup and drill advancement rate. Monitoring can assist in identifying and remedying events where soil cuttings are not being conveyed sufficiently and fluid pressure is building-up. The contractor’s contingency plan should include adequate response training for staff and maintaining materials, equipment, and resources required to respond to a release event. 4.4 Replace On Bridge The General Edwards Bridge was designed and built in 1934. The water main suspended from the bridge is a 20” diameter steel pipe with a 1/2” wall thickness. Water main changes to 30” diameter steel in the bridge support towers and the tunnel shafts (navigation channel crossing). The water main was installed as part of the original bridge construction. The pipe is supported by the bridge structure in the approach spans, travels through the west side towers at piers 5 and 6, then crosses the fender system to the pipe tunnel shaft entrances. The water main/pipe is directly supported by a radius cut beam section which sits on top of the original bridge pipe support beams. There are no pipe rollers installed on the structure, so the pipe slides along the radially cut beam section. The pipe was originally designed to expand and contract at the designated pipe expansion joints each with associated stabilizer anchor frames fixed to the pipe and to the girder webs. 4-8 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY In December 2015, Green International Affiliates performed a visual inspection of the exposed length of the existing pipe, supports and end connections throughout the bridge approach spans, tower transition areas, and pipe tunnel entrance shafts. This inspection results were summarized in a memorandum “Task 2.1.2, Water Main Condition Findings,” prepared by Green International Affiliates and dated February 25, 2016. The conclusion of field reconnaissance was that the water main in the bridge approach spans is in poor to serious condition with pitted surfaces and evidence of three historic pipe ruptures. Laboratory analysis on pipe and bridge support coatings and insulation revealed heavy metals and asbestos, as detailed in the memorandum “Hazardous Building Materials Investigation Services” dated June 29, 2016. The tunnel shaft exposed pipe areas were identified in poor condition. Pipe supports and support beams through the approach spans were found to be in poor condition. During inspection cracks at the welded connection of the expansion joint stabilizer supports and girder webs were identified in spans 5, 9, and 11. These deficiencies were reported to MassDOT. Since it seemed the Section 56 water main stabilizer supports were compromising the integrity of the bridge girders, MassDOT requested the MWRA to perform an analysis of the pipe support system in order to cut the fixed stabilizer supports and pipe to eliminate longitudinal forces on the bridge girders, while ensuring a stable pipe support system would remain in place. The subsequent inspection included the in-depth hands-on inspection of the previously identified welds of the longitudinal frames to the girder webs, as well as the identification of any other welds associated with the support or stabilization of the MWRA ’s water main. Review of scope required to satisfy MassDOT’s concern over longitudinal forces apparently imparted by the water main system on the bridge girders is not included in this study. Removal and replacement of pipe on the bridge would include cutting and removing the existing water main above river level and replacement with a new steel or ductile iron water main essentially in the same location. Water main in tunnels and tunnel shafts have not been inspected. Per discussion with the MWRA, similar tunnel shafts have been observed in poor condition. The tunnel and tunnel shafts could be rehabilitated with a structural liner or replaced. For a comprehensive long-lasting solution, Weston & Sampson presents replacing the existing tunnel shaft with a new 180-foot tunnel shaft installed via microtunneling. On the bridge, pipe support beams would need to be removed and replaced where conditions require (34 deteriorated supports identified out of 117 total supports). A substitute for the fixed stabilizer frames (7 identified - attached adjacent to the pipe expansion joints) would need to be configured to secure the main but allow for expansion and contraction. It is possible the owner of the bridge, MassDOT, would require complete bridge structural analysis to determine the impact of the proposed water main replacement on the existing bridge. If the MWRA wished to upsize the water main then structural analysis would almost certainly be required. Removal and replacement of pipe on the bridge will require handling and disposal of existing pipe insulation which contains asbestos, and handling and disposal of existing pipe coatings which contain asbestos and heavy metals. Asbestos abatement must be performed in accordance with EPA and Massachusetts regulations. A Massachusetts licensed asbestos abatement contractor will be required to remove asbestos containing materials scheduled for removal. As the new pipe will likely be required to occupy a similar corridor as the existing pipe, asbestos containing materials need to be removed before new pipe installation proceeds. The handling and disposal of materials containing heavy metals must be performed in accordance with the health and safety measures outlined in OSHA regulations. The possibility of future replacement of the General Edwards Bridge should be weighed in the decision over whether to mount a replacement pipe on the bridge. The Federal Highway Administration National Bridge Inventory database indicates that the last inspection of the General Edwards Bridge was performed in June 2014 (presumably secured by the Owner, MassDOT) and deck, superstructure, and 4-9 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY substructure condition ratings were “5”, “5”, and “4” respectively. A structurally deficient bridge is one for which the deck, superstructure, or substructure is rated 4 or less, on a scale of 1-9 (9 being “excellent” and zero being “imminent failure”). In addition to condition deficiencies, another driver of bridge replacement might be local interest for aesthetic betterments. The General Edwards Bridge area is considered the gateway to the Lynn Municipal Harbor area, where an expansive plan for high-end residential, commercial, and marina development is underway. If the bridge was replaced, a replacement bridge might be constructed in the space immediately east of the bridge, where a bridge existed prior to the 1934 construction of the General Edwards Bridge. Bridge replacement would require replacement of the water main again, at least within the limits of the bridge superstructure. 4.5 Typical Profile for River Crossing Methods Depth of utility installation for each river crossing method would be determined in design. For a general comparison between methods, a typical profile rendering has been prepared and is attached in Appendix H. The figure shares a conceptual depth of utility installation for each method overlaid on boring data from the General Edwards Bridge record drawings. 4-10 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 4.6 Pipe Installation Method Summary Table 3 summarizes general advantages, disadvantages, and risks associated with the pipe installation methods discussed herein.

Installation methods including open trench river crossing, horizontal directional drilling, microtunneling, and removal and replacement on the bridge were considered. Section 6 generally describes each pipe installation route alternative identified. 5.1 Overview Eight (8) route alternatives were identified and characterized. Full sized plans showing all-routes over an existing conditions plan, and all-routes over an orthophoto, are attached in Appendix D. A reduced depiction of all-routes over orthophoto is shown in Figure 53 on the following page. River crossing routes alternatives can be grouped in one of four geographic areas relative to the General Edwards Bridge: • East of the Bridge (Route 1, Route 2, Route 3, Route 7): This area provided accessible paths for open trench and microtunneling pipe installation at a modest distance from the bridge. Space constraints between the shore and a proposed development required HDD to be shifted farther east to find adequate space for staging areas and pipe string construction. River crossings to the far east required longer river crossing and on-land pipe installation. • Abutting the Bridge (Route 4, Route 5): Included routes immediately adjacent to the existing bridge corridor. This area provided for more direct route alignments, but passed through the layout of existing and historic structures in the area. • West of Bridge (Route 6): This area required long trenchless pipe installation lengths and substantial over land pipe installation. Pipe installation via horizontal direction drill most appropriate for this area due to long river crossing lengths. • On Bridge (Route 8): Installed under the bridge and in a tunnel, in an alignment approximately congruous that of the existing water main. Land acquisition and easement requirements were estimated for each alternative. In this section, estimated easements are identified for each route by Parcel ID, Owner, Location, and Easement Type. “Temporary” easements are those required for the construction duration only. “Permanent” easements are those required for long-term pipeline occupation of a space. The MWRA may choose to purchase land instead of securing permanent easements. Appendix K has a detailed tabulation of land acquisition and easements with more details including assessed values for buildings, features, and land. Property value and perceived depreciation value were relevant factors in Weston & Sampson’s estimation of probable cost of land acquisition. Permits required for each alternative are described herein. A detailed tabulation of permits for all alternatives is presented in the Permit Matrix attached in Appendix J. The matrix indicates general comment on the context for determination of applicability. 5-1 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Figure 53 – Routes over Orthophoto 5.2 Route 1A –Open Trench A prospective route for open trench pipe installation is shown in Appendix I Figure 3A. The prospective route for open trench pipe installation is the same as that proposed for microtunneling (shown on Appendix I Figure 3B). The trench alignment does not necessarily need to be a straight line. The horizontal alignment can be adjusted to avoid existing features. The degree of adjustment is dependent on the flexibility of the pipe. The open trench pipe installation route shown on Figure 3A is approximately 1,250-feet long and extends from shore adjacent to Rice Avenue, in Revere, to parcels east of the Lynnway in Lynn. Over-land cut & cover pipe installation would be required in Lynn (private parcels) and Revere (Rice Avenue) to connect the river crossing pipe to the existing MWRA Section 56 water main in the Lynnway. Uncertainties include dredged sediment contamination and related impacts to costs and environmental permitting, as well as tidal currents across the proposed alignment. The alignment could be moved further east if currents become an issue. The length of the crossing would be greater but risks of sediment disturbance may be less. 5-2 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Dredging activities and pipe assembly and placement are typically completed from barges on the river. There will need to be an on-shore staging area to store pipe and anchorage materials, equipment used on the barges, and possibly for dredged material storage and handling. The proposed route passes through parcels owned by the Point of Pines Yacht Club and WMI Lynn LLC (Joseph O’Donnell). Rice Avenue in Revere is a publicly accepted way. The barges are fitted with anchor piles that can be lowered into the river bottom to maintain a stable work position. Barges are maneuvered by tug boats. The pipe installation barge is usually equipped with a ramp or slide that guides the pipe and prevents excessive deflection of joints or bending during installation. As the barge is advanced, the pipe slides down the ramp and into the trench in a controlled manner. Pipe assembly either by welding steel, fusing HDPE or making up the Ductile Iron joints is accomplished on the pipe barge ahead of the ramp. The pipe barge(s) are generally long enough to allow for several joints to be made during deployment of assembled sections so the operation is more-or-less continuous. If there is room available on-shore, the full length of pipe can be assembled on one bank and pulled into position in the trench using a combination of tugboat, barge, divers, and winching from the opposite shore. Weighted collars can be added to the pipe as installation progresses.

Finished pipeline performance and risk criteria were evaluated to yield a composite rating score for each alternative. A summary of ratings earned by each route alternative, as well as a detailed tabulation of observations and facts contributing to the rating, is presented in Appendix L. Conceptual cost and schedule were estimated for each alternative, as presented in Appendix M and Appendix N. The ranking score, conceptual cost, and conceptual schedule together provide a basis for comparative evaluation of route alternatives. 6.1 Composite Ranking Each route alternative was evaluated with respect to finished pipeline (as-built) performance and various implementation-related risk factors. The screening criteria were established to capture the relative advantage or risk of each route-alternative. Each criterion was assigned a score one to five, with scores applied as follows: 1 - Very Low Risk / Strong Advantage 2 - Low Risk / Advantage 3 - Medium Risk / Neither an advantage or a disadvantage 4 - High Risk / Disadvantage 5 - Very High Risk / Strong Disadvantage The sum of ratings applied to Pipeline Performance and Program Risks criteria established the composite, or total, rating. Criteria did not always include alternatives rated with a score of one or five. This was the case where the difference in advantageousness or risk was more appropriately weighted with a narrower rating spread. The lowest composite rating was ranked the highest from a technical advantageousness perspective. Appendix L includes a summary of ratings applied for performance and risk criteria and a tabular detail of the observations and facts contributing to the rating score applied. The narratives that follow describe the evaluation criteria and the factors that contributed to high and low rankings applied. 6.1.1 Pipeline Performance Pipeline performance criteria included Access for Maintenance, Protection Against Damage, and Hydraulics. These criteria captured the relative advantage or disadvantage of the finished solution after the system was successfully installed and in-operation. Useful service life was not evaluated as each installation option can provide for a pipeline useful life significantly greater than 50 years, with failure more likely a function of material specification and factors outside of MWRA control than route alternative and installation method. Access For Maintenance “Access For Maintenance” captured the advantage in accessibility of the finished pipeline for operations and maintenance activities. The lowest rating (1-strongest advantage) was applied where installed pipe was generally accessible through paved public ways by the MWRA with equipment and labor maintained in-house. The highest rating (5-strong disadvantage) was applied where the river crossing pipe and on-land pipe posed accessibility issues. 6-1 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Protection Against Damage “Protection Against Damage” captured the risk of damage from outside forces due to pipe location or configuration. The lowest rating (2-low risk) was applied where the pipe was confidently protected from known risks that might be incurred by aging infrastructure, environmental factors, and human influences. The highest rating (5-very high risk) was applied where pipe was most exposed to risk by aging infrastructure, environmental factors, and human influences. Hydraulics “Hydraulics” captured the advantage in finished pipeline hydraulics. The lowest rating (3-neither an advantage or disadvantage) was applied where the alternative provided for pipe sizing at the discretion of the MWRA and a variety of advantageous pipe materials. The highest rating (5- strong disadvantage) was applied where the alterative would likely limit pipe size and/or material due to requirements of the method or location. 6.1.2 Program Risks Program Risks included Permitting Approval Difficulty, Technical Complexity, Construction Risk, Environmental Risk, Impact on Abutters & Motorists, Easements & Land Acquisition, and MassDOT/DCR Support. These criteria captured the relative risk associated with implementing a route alternative. Permitting Approval Difficulty “Permitting Approval Difficulty” captured the relative rigor associated with permitting other alternatives. The lowest rating (2-advantage) was applied where typical permits required of construction in this low elevation coastal project area were required. The highest rating (5-strong disadvantage) was applied where the most rigorous and risky permitting obligations were required of an alternative, especially where the permits would include risk of denial or overly burdensome requirements due to disadvantageous environmental risk compared to alternatives or other factors (ie MEPA EIR). Permits estimated to be required for each route are listed in Appendix J, Permit Matrix. Technical Complexity “Technical Complexity” captured the relative planning and engineering rigor required to responsibly engineer and execute the proposed scope. “Scope Complexity” considered factors related to scale of scope, facets of scope, scope alignment with geologic and site conditions, and coordination of work (among others). “Potential Conflicts” considered existing and historic structures that would require accommodation and drive complexity in engineering design and construction coordination. The lowest rating (3-neither an advantage or a disadvantage) was applied where the team observed moderate technical complexity compared to other alternatives. The highest rating (5-strong disadvantage) was applied where the team observed most rigorous technical complexity compared to other alternatives. Construction Risk “Construction Risk” captured the estimated risk that will remain in the construction phase with typical risk mitigation applied in design and construction. Construction risk can result from factors relevant to other criteria, such as Technical Complexity, Environmental Risk, and Impact on Abutters & Stakeholders. The lowest rating (3-medium risk) was applied where the team 6-2 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY observed moderate construction risk. The highest rating (5-very high risk) was applied where the team observed very high construction risk. Environmental Risk “Environmental Risk” captured the estimated risk to the environment by a proposed alternative. Receptors considered included habitats, water quality, and species of concern. Risk associated with remediation of hazardous/contaminated materials encountered also considered. The lowest rating (2-low risk) was applied where the team observed relatively low environmental risk. The highest rating (5-very high risk) was applied where the team observed very high environmental risk. Impact on Abutters and Motorists “Impact on Abutters and Motorists” captured the scope and scale of impact due to construction operations on abutters and motorists. Noise, aesthetics, reduction in service in roadways, and detours were considered. These impacts were considered with respect to duration, breadth of impact, and sensitivity of impacted interests. The lowest rating (2-advantage) was applied where the team observed modest impact to abutters and motorists compared to other alternatives. The highest rating (5-strong disadvantage) was applied where the team observed significant impact to abutters and motorists compared to other alternatives. Easements & Land Acquisition “Easements & Land Acquisition” captured the rigor associated with land acquisition and easements compared to alternatives. The lowest rating (1-strong advantage) was applied where minimal expense, complexity, and risk is estimated associated with new land acquisition and easements. The highest rating (5-strong disadvantage) was applied where significant expense, complexity, and risk is estimated associated with new land acquisition and easements. MassDOT/DCR Support “MassDOT/DCR Support” captured how well an alternative aligned with the apparent interests of MassDOT and DCR. Interests of each organization included maintenance of service within roadways of their jurisdiction, and limiting risk incurred by the Project on their future operation, maintenance and/or replacement. The lowest rating (2-advantage) was applied where an alternative was estimated to be viewed favorably by MassDOT and DCR. The highest rating (4- disadvantage) was applied where an alternative was estimated to be viewed unfavorably by MassDOT and DCR. 6.2 Probable Cost Screening-level cost estimates were prepared to allow for comparison of probable cost among route alternatives. The team sought consistency in approach and accuracy appropriate for the application. The approach included itemizing work in a manner that was readily estimated by the project team, measuring quantities, and applying engineering judgement, by qualified team members, to estimate unit and lump sum prices. Conceptual cost estimates for each alternative were prepared and submitted in June 2016, then subsequently revised. Screening-level cost estimates and assumptions are presented in Appendix M. 6-3 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Expense categories included in screening cost estimates included Engineering, Land Acquisition and Easements, Construction, and Contingency: • Engineering expense included contract professional services furnished for engineering design, bidding, permitting, land acquisition, construction administration, and resident representation. Engineering design, bidding, construction administration, and resident representation services were estimated by identifying a typical labor rate and monthly labor utilization, then extending monthly resources expenditure to task duration, as indicated in Section 6.3. This approach was then then checked versus typical expense ratios for engineering services compared to construction cost. Permitting and Land Acquisition/Easement expense was separately estimated based on detailed study by-route, described in Section 5 and the Appendices. The average ratio engineering to construction expense was 27%. • Land Acquisition and Easements value was estimated as described in Section 5.1, and as detailed in Appendix K. Land acquisition and easements was estimated on a case-by-case basis, and was not assigned as a percent of construction cost. • Construction scope was itemized into substantive work scopes, measured, and estimated by qualified members of the project team based on professional judgement and project experience. Detailed backup for unit prices was not prepared for screening-level cost estimates. Work itemization included river crossing scopes (fixed and per foot), over land pipe installation (per foot), appurtenances, surface restoration, hauling and disposal of surplus excavated material, mobilization and incidentals, and uniformed officers for traffic control. Estimates accounted for markup and overhead associated with a general contractor managing specialty scopes performed by a subcontractor. At the time of screening-level cost estimation, costs were modeled assuming 24-inch diameter water main would be installed in the project area. • Contingency was included in the sum of twenty five percent (25%) of estimated construction, engineering, and land acquisition expense, per the MWRA’s recommendations for feasibility study cost estimation. The Engineering News Record (“ENR”) 20 Cities Construction Cost Index (“CCI”) value for June 2016 is 10,337. The ENR Boston CCI for June 2016 is 13,159. Conceptual costs were escalated to an ENR 20 Cities CCI index value approximately 11,000. 6.3 Schedule Screening-level schedule estimates were prepared to allow for comparison of probable schedule duration among route alternatives. The team sought consistency in approach and accuracy appropriate for the application. Conceptual schedule estimates for each alternative were prepared in June 2016, then subsequently revised. Complete itemized schedules for each route alternative are attached in Appendix N. Schedule tasks included Procurement of a Consultant, Preliminary Design, Final Design, Permitting, Bid Ready Documents, Land Acquisition and Easements, Bidding and Award, and Construction. • Procurement of a Consultant will result in securing contract engineering services from a consultant. The task is estimated to require about 6-months for all alternatives. MWRA notes that an additional 3-months may be required, for a total of 9-months. The extended period is represented in detailed review of schedule for the recommended alternatives in Section 7 of this report. 6-4 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY • Preliminary Design was typically estimated about 8-months, and will include survey, subsurface exploration, base map development, and a preliminary design report. Duration for MWRA review and comment was included. Preliminary design is the first phase of contract engineering services. • Final Design includes iterative submittal of advancing drawings and contract documents and MWRA review. 8-months was typically estimated for final design. Final design follows preliminary design. • Permitting duration was estimated for each alternative based on permits identified for each route alternative in Section 5 of this report. The Permitting period was estimated to begin midway through Final Design as initial contract documents provided sufficient information to begin some permitting obligations. The net duration of Permitting was typically driven by long duration permits which require Final Design provisions incorporated. • Bid Ready Documents follows Final Design and will incorporate revisions per permit, land acquisition, and stakeholder requirements. Bid Ready Documents concluded after conclusion of Permitting and Land Acquisition and Easements tasks. • Land Acquisition and Easements involves negotiation of easements with project area land owners. Abutters should also be canvassed during this period. Land Acquisition and Easements should begin as soon as practical, and are modeled to start concurrent with Preliminary Design. • Bidding and Award is estimated to require 6 months. This task will follow completion of Bid Ready Documents, and result in a secured construction contractor. • Construction involves implementation of water main installation and is the final phase of the project. Task duration was estimated as the sum of associated activities, including mobilization, river crossing pipe installation, over land pipe installation, connections to the existing system, water main testing and disinfection, surface restoration, and demobilization. The duration of active construction operations varied from 9 to 11 months depending on alternative. Mobilization was typically allowed an additional 3-months. 6-5 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 6.4 Results Table 6 summarizes composite rating, probable costs, and construction duration for the route alternatives reviewed, sorted by composite ranking with highest rated first. Cost and schedule information presented is per screening-level estimates, and have not been superseded with detailed estimates performed for the recommended alternatives. A detailed tabulation of observations and facts contributing to the rating score is presented in Appendix L. Conceptual cost and schedule estimates are detailed in Appendix M and Appendix N.

The open trench river crossing alternative was comparable in cost to HDD options, but included greater environmental risk, greater permitting difficulty, and a longer schedule duration. The alternative for pipe replacement on the bridge scored less favorably due to reduced protection against damage, hydraulic limitations, greater technical complexity, and greater construction risk. Relocation of Section 56 to a dedicated corridor will provide protection from weather exposure above grade and eliminate reliance on aging MassDOT bridge infrastructure. Based on composite ranking, cost, and schedule, HDD Route 3 and Route 7 are the top ranked alternatives. Each route shares drill entry at Hanson Street in Lynn. The routes have different drill exit locations, with Route 3 exiting near the end of the Point of Pines on Rice Avenue, and Route 7 exiting near the Point of Pines Yacht Club off Rice Avenue. An overview of differentiating factors among routes Route 3 and Route 7 is as follows: • Route 3 –Requires greater over-land pipe installation to connect to the existing main (2,900 feet) and is a relatively longer river-crossing route (2,500 feet). These factors contribute to it being the higher cost option. The location of crossing is at the broadest point in the river mouth which will reduce opportunity for scour of overlying earth by tidal and river flows over time. Risk of unknown historic piles along Route 3 is viewed as lower than along Route 7 since it is less likely that historic pile supported structures are present along Route 3 compared to Route 7. However, additional permitting may be required for Route 3 to due to habitat for a threatened bird species. This route may impact residential abutters in the Point of Pines area more significantly due to longer overland pipe installation and bore exit pit located squarely in Rice Avenue. Easements will be required with Point of Pines Beach Association, The City of Revere, WMI Lynn LLC, and Massachusetts Electric Company. Pipe string construction will require agreement with 6-6 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Massachusetts Electric Company (NGrid) to occupy the entire length of their parcel during pipe string construction. • Route 7 – Requires less over-land pipe installation to connect to the existing main (1,700 feet) but a slightly longer river-crossing route (2,700 feet). The combined impact results in Route 7 being considered slightly less costly than Route 3. However, Route 7 is perceived to have higher technical complexity and greater construction and post-construction risk because the alignment is subparallel to and therefore crosses a greater length of the Lynn seawall. This means there is greater risk of conflict between the HDD bore and the piles supporting the wall and wall anchorage system as compared to Route 3. There is also a risk of conflicts between the pipe bore and former electrical transmission tower foundations. Final design studies may determine that this risk is less than currently perceived depending on what information can be determined regarding the tip elevations of the existing piles. There is also a greater possibility of future risk to the pipeline if the seawall is repaired or replace, or if pile-supported marine structures are built extending out from the seawall in the future (i.e. new piles would be driven in proximity to the installed pipe). Route 7 has slightly less risk from a permitting perspective as it avoids construction near Revere’s barrier beach listed as a habitat for a threatened bird species. Easements will be required from the Point of Pines Yacht Club, The City of Revere, WMI Lynn LLC, and Massachusetts Electric Company. Pipe string construction will require agreement with Massachusetts Electric Company (NGrid) to occupy the entire length of their parcel during pipe string construction. O:\\MWRA\\2150821-Bridge Crossing FS\\C7500 File\\13 Subtasks\\3.3 Final Feasibility Study\\Feasibility Study Final Report.docx 6-7 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 7.0 RECOMMENDED PIPE REPLACEMENT ALTERNATIVES Based on composite ranking, cost, and schedule, HDD Route 3 and Route 7 are the top ranked alternatives. Each route shares drill entry at Hanson Street in Lynn. The routes have different drill exit locations, with Route 3 exiting near the end of the Point of Pines on Rice Avenue, and Route 7 exiting near the Point of Pines Yacht Club off Rice Avenue. Weston & Sampson recommends that both Route 3 and Route 7 be carried forward into preliminary design for further evaluation. 7.1 Routes and Staging HDD is the advised method for replacing the deteriorated portion of the Section 56 water main crossing the Saugus River. Based on composite ranking, cost, and schedule, HDD Route 3 and Route 7 are the top ranked alternatives. Route 3 river crossing is approximately 2,500-feet long, with 2,900-feet of over- land pipe installation. Route 7 river crossing is approximately 2,700-feet long, with 1,700-feet of over- land pipe installation. Both routes connect to the Section 56 water main in the City of Revere on the Lynnway near the ramp onto State Route 1A North, and in the City of Lynn on the Lynnway opposite Hanson Street. Conceptual plans for both routes, and expanded detail related to work limits at staging areas, are attached as Appendix O. Conceptual profiles for both routes are attached as Appendix P. The Lynn Harbor area has abundant space for horizontal directional drill staging and pipe sting construction. Staging area in Revere is much more limited. Therefore, each Route 3 and Route 7 propose drill entry staging from a location near the end of Hanson Street in Lynn. At the time of this report, it is understood that these parcels are not scheduled for development, and appear good candidates to secure temporary easements and permanent easements. Therefore, it is proposed that the two operations requiring the largest land area, pipe string construction and drill entry staging, each be performed from Lynn. As the pipe string is always pulled from the end of the hole back to the rig, staging each pipe string construction and drill entry in Lynn will require either 1) that the drill rig be relocated from Lynn to Revere to pull the pipe string after reaming, or 2) that the HDD contractor set-up a second rig at the drill exit to pull pipe. Operations in the drill entry staging area will require a minimum 3- to 4- months construction activity. Pipe sting construction in Lynn will require construction of a substantial pipe sting on a National Grid property north of Hanson Street. Operations on the site will ideally be performed from on, or immediately abutting, the Riley Way access road, to limit impact to the capped landfill inland. Cranes may be required to suspend and orient the pipe sting during the 1-day operation when the pipe is pulled into the bore hole. HDD operations can be performed from the Lynn staging area without blocking Hanson Street or the private access road, Riley Way. Typical HDD staging equipment and configuration are depicted in Figures 51 and 52 of Section 4.3. Route 3 and Route 7 differ in locations of drill exit in the City of Revere and in the angle that the alignments cross the Lynn seawall. Route 3 drill exit is near the end of Point of Pines peninsula on Rice Avenue. Route 7 drill exit is in the general vicinity of the Point of Pines Yacht Club Parking lot, Rice Avenue, and Fowler Street. The Route 3 drill exit will be within Rice Avenue, which is a two-lane local street with concrete sidewalk and a concrete retaining wall abutting. Drill exit staging area operations are more limited in area and duration than those at the drill entry staging area. Activities will include driving of a starter casing, management and monitoring of fluids, and pipe pullback. Duration of activity in the drill exit staging area is estimated to be 1-month, as detailed in the project schedule attached in Appendix S. The first 2-weeks of operations at the drill exit staging area will require typical work week construction hours. The second two weeks of operations at the drill exit staging area will require 7-1 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY continuous activity at the site. Construction operations in the Route 3 drill exit staging area will require detour of traffic around the work zone. Open trench pipe installation in Rice Avenue and Hanson Street will require typical construction work zone management for water main installation in a local street, including detour of the work zone to through-traffic during typical construction hours. All staging areas, apart from the short-duration pipe sting construction area, shall be partitioned from public access by temporary construction fences and traffic control devices. Excavations will be protected from access, plated, or backfilled each day. In the City of Lynn staging area, clearing and grubbing of trees and brush may be required. Surfaces in easements should be restored with plantings similar to existing at the conclusion of work. Surfaces in public streets should be restored curb-to-curb within the work zone. Pavement restoration should include temporary trench patch, settlement for 90- days, and curb-to-curb pavement milling and overlay. Surface restoration will result in an aesthetically pleasing new roadway surface for abutters after conclusion of work. The finished pipeline will include fused or welded water main across the river, bell and spigot water main in local streets, and connections between dissimilar systems. Anchor blocks should be installed at the connection of the fused or welded river crossing pipe to the bell and spigot pipe. Anchor blocks will restrain against separation due to thermal expansion from seasonal variations in water supply temperature. The anchoring system will be buried without evidence from the surface. Aspects of the new water main system visible from the surface at project conclusion will include cabinets for cathodic protection and manhole covers associated with valve vaults. The valve vaults will house valves for system control and air release valves to discharge air trapped in the pipeline. They will be required at each end of the river crossing, at project the extents, and at intermediate locations as required. Vehicles should be allowed to drive-over vaults, as they will be structurally rated to carry vehicle loading, but location might be coordinated to limit incidence of vehicles consistently blocking access to the vault cover. One new cabinet for cathodic protection is assumed to be required on each end of the project. The cabinet will typically be located near the property line, accessible from the roadway, and placed to avoid conflict/obstruction. The cathodic protection cabinets have an aesthetic similar to a typical traffic signal cabinets or electrical lighting cabinets. 7.2 Land Acquisition and Easements Land acquisition and easement requirements were estimated for the recommended routes. “Temporary” easements are those required for the construction duration only. “Permanent” easements are those required for long-term pipeline occupation of a space. The limit of permanent easement, and the nature of use restrictions, should be consistent with that typically required of MWRA for its pipelines. Terms of permanent easement may include prohibiting permanent construction within a distance from the pipeline, prohibiting significant change in finished grade, maintaining accessibility, and compliance with the 8M Permit program. The MWRA may choose to purchase land instead of securing permanent easements. Appendix K includes a detailed tabulation of land acquisition and easements with more details including assessed values for buildings, features, and land. Property value and perceived depreciation value were relevant factors in Weston & Sampson’s estimation of probable cost of land acquisition. Occupation of Local Streets & Tidal Flat (Route 3 and Route 7) The MWRA may need to negotiate grants of location for new permanent occupation of public lands. Over-land cut & cover pipe installation is required in Hanson Street and Rice Avenue to connect the river 7-2 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY crossing pipe to the existing Section 56 water main in State Route 1A. Hanson Street and Rice Avenue are publicly accepted ways with local jurisdiction. Also, the new pipeline passes through a City of Lynn owned tidal flat (Parcel 033-752-065). Occupation of Drill Entry & Pipe String Construction Staging Area in Lynn (Route 3 and Route 7) Temporary easement for use of WMI Lynn LLC (Parcel 034-752-077), Massachusetts Electric Co (National Grid; Parcel 034-752-075), and Capri Properties (Walmart; 034-759-003) will be required for construction staging and pipe sting construction operations. Permanent easement at WMI Lynn LLC (Parcel 034-752-077) will be required for permanent pipe occupation. • The National Grid site, as described in Section 3.5.6, has an existing closed municipal landfill site which was capped in 1986 and is not receiving waste at this time. There does not appear to be significant activity at the site since operations are closed and transmission lines are removed. Pipe sting construction could be performed adjacent to the access road in the site without putting the existing landfill systems at-risk. • The WMI Lynn LLC site is owned by the same party developing the site described in Section 3.1.10, but there are no active plans for development at this time. The proposed pipe would be located near the property line and partially within the waterfront zoning offset (200-feet per), so it is estimated that the new pipeline will incur only modest future use limitation. As the land is currently utilized, it appears a good space to secure temporary easement for HDD drill entry and general pipeline project staging. • Beyond a finished parking lot in the rear used for loading, Walmart appears to own a section of unused land which might provide some working space at the rear of the drill entry staging area. Occupation of Drill Exit Staging Area in Revere (Route 3) Permanent easement with the Point of Pines Beach Association (Parcel 14-192O-23) will be required for permanent pipe occupation of the space between Rice Avenue and the low tide line. Occupation of Drill Exit Staging Area in Revere (Route 7) Temporary easement for use of the City of Revere Pump Station parking lot (Parcel Unknown) and the Point of Pines Yacht Club parking lot (Parcel 14-192O-14A) will be required for bore exit staging. Permanent easement at the City of Revere Pump Station parking lot (Parcel Unknown) will be required for permanent pipe occupation. • The parking lot off Rice Avenue proposed for Route 7 drill exit is partially owned by the City of Revere and partially owned by the Yacht Club. The proposed Route alternative proposes permanent pipe occupation in lands owned by the City of Revere. • Temporary easement with the City of Revere and the Point of Pines Yacht Club will be required to occupy space during the horizontal directional drill. Operations will likely require occupying substantial portions of the parking lot, and into Rice Avenue during reaming and pipe-pull. Some permanent use limitations may be required at the edge of the property to comply with MWRA buffer requirements. 7.3 Permits The permit matrix attached in Appendix J indicates permits required of the recommended route alternatives. Comment and context for determination is included in the table. This list is subject to change in Preliminary Design as the engineer confirms limits of applicable resource areas, further 7-3 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY defines the scope and sequence, and agencies of jurisdiction confirm applicability. Permits required for the Preliminary Design Scope, Subsurface Exploration, are listed in Section 7.7.4. Permits or approvals that should be secured during design, and prior to bid of the construction contract, for each Route 3 and Route 7 include: • U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - General Permit, Preconstruction Notification • U.S. Environmental Protection Agency - NPDES Construction General Permit, Notice of Intent • Advisory Council on Historic Preservation - Section 106 National Historic Preserv. Act • MA Office of Coastal Zone Management - Consistency Determination • MA Department of Environmental Protection – Chapter 91 Waterways License • MA Department of Environmental Protection – Distribution Modifications for Systems • MA Highway Department – Permit to Access State Highway with Traffic Management Plan • MA Department of Conservation and Recreation – Access Permit • MA Historical Commission – Historical/Archeological Preservation Review, Project Notification Form • Massachusetts Water Resources Authority – 8(m) Permit • City of Lynn Conservation Commission – Notice of Intent • City of Revere Conservation Commission – Notice of Intent Additionally, for Route 3, the following permits should be secured during design due to work near a habitat for a threatened bird species: • National Marine Fisheries and/or US Fish and Wildlife Service – Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, Endangered Species Review • MA Division of Fisheries and Wildlife - Natural Heritage and Endangered Species, Project Review Form A Utility Related Abatement Measure (URAM) should be filed with the MA Department of Environmental Protection prior to the start of construction if soil precharacterization identifies contaminated materials in exceedance of the applicable regulatory thresholds. The MWRA should require the construction contractor to secure local Street Opening Permits with the City of Lynn and the City of Revere, and to contact Dig Safe prior to performing any excavation. 7.4 Risks and Risk Management Risks need to be considered at each stage of the Project, including planning, design, and implementation. The purpose of risk management is to assure that the project incorporates appropriate, efficient, and cost-effective measures to mitigate project related risk. Risks may be described and characterized with respect to “consequence of occurrence” and “likelihood of occurrence”. Tables 7 and 8 outline a basis for characterizing likelihood of occurrence and consequence of occurrence. 7-4 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Value Criteria Low Less than 35% chance of occurring Medium 36 – 70% chance of occurring High Greater than 71% chance of occurring Table 7: Risk Likelihood of Occurrence Scale Value Criteria Negligible Minimal consequence to the program Some potential for increase in costs Slight potential for schedule change Marginal Small reduction in program performance Cost estimate marginally exceed budget Minor slip in schedule with milestone impacted Moderate Moderate reduction in program performance Cost estimate moderately exceed budget Moderate slip in schedule that effects program Critical Goals of the program cannot be achieved Cost Estimates seriously exceed budget Unacceptable schedule slip Crisis Program can not be completed Cost estimates unacceptable exceed budget Catastrophic threat to program, operation of system or people Table 8: Consequence of Occurrence Scale Design phase (DES) and construction phase (CON) risks were evaluated for Route 3 and Route 7. A list of identified risks is included below. A detailed description of the risk, consequence, and mitigation strategy is provided in Appendix Q, along with characterization of risk likelihood of occurrence and consequence of occurrence. Risks identified and detailed were as follows: • DES-001 Commercial Abutter Concerns • DES-002 Residential Abutter Concerns • DES-003 Emergency Services Concerns • DES-004 Local and State Leadership Concerns • DES-005 Permanent Easement Acquisition • DES-006 Temporary Easement Acquisition • DES-007 Permit Acquisition • DES-008 Identification of Unsuitable Subsurface Conditions • DES-009 Identify Obstructions in Bore Path • DES-010 Contaminated Materials Identification • DES-011 Coordination with Other Activities • CON-001 Conflict with Obstruction • CON-002 Inadvertent Return of Drilling Fluids to the Environment • CON-003 Drilling Fluid Circulation Loss • CON-004 Stuck Pipeline During Pullback • CON-005 Alignment Control 7-5 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY • CON-006 Borehole Collapse • CON-007 Damage to Product Pipe • CON-008 Surface Heave • CON-009 Settlement • CON-010 Weather Conditions • CON-011 Encounter Unknown Contaminated Materials • CON-012 Equipment Reliability & Maintenance • CON-013 Abutter Concerns • CON-014 Construction Delays • CON-015 Vandalism Effective risk management will require frequent monitoring and timely mitigation. Design risk management activities should proceed as soon as practical to provide the greatest benefit. Construction risk management activities should be performed continuously during construction, and be supported by strong contract requirements and clear work/mitigation plan submittals. Key risks and risk mitigation approaches are described below. • DES-004: Local and State Leadership Concerns – The risk includes that the proposed project operations, and/or use of land, conflicts with leadership vision for the work area. The consequence of realizing the risk may include alternative route selection. To mitigate, the MWRA may inform applicable local and state leadership of the proposed scope and it’s project benefits, provide a venue for discourse over the scope of work and concerns, and incorporate measures into design that mitigate the concerns as practical. • DES-005: Permanent Easement Acquisition - The risk includes delay or failure to secure permanent easements required to rightfully occupy the proposed pipeline corridor. The consequence of realizing the risk may include alternative route selection or schedule delays. To mitigate, applicable property owners should be contacted as early as possible to ensure adequate time for acquisition of property. Early engagement would avoid investing excessive effort in an alternative that has limited chance of success. Study equitable recapitulation for permanent easements, prepare for presentation to key property owners, and administer negotiations. Critical negotiations will be with Point of Pines Beach Association and WMI Lynn LLC for Route 3. Critical negotiations will be with City of Revere and WMI Lynn LLC for Route #7. • DES-006: Temporary Easement Acquisition – The risk includes failure to secure temporary easements required on lands that would be occupied by construction operations. The consequence of realizing the risk is requisite alternative pipe string construction staging and/or pipeline routing. To mitigate, property owners should be contacted as early as possible to ensure adequate time for acquisition of temporary easement. Study equitable recapitulation for temporary easements, prepare for presentation to key property owners, and administer negotiations. Critical negotiations will be with Massachusetts Electric Co for Route 3, and Massachusetts Electric Co and Point of Pines Yacht Club for Route 7. • DES-007: Permit Acquisition – The risk includes that permit requirements may impact cost, schedule and/or approach viability. The consequence of realizing the risk is that permitting delays result in schedule slip and require provisions that increase program cost. To mitigate, incorporate into design sufficient accommodation for protecting public use of the waterways and 7-6 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY abutting recreational spaces, maintaining use of the navigable waterway, maintaining sufficient protection and contingency measures related to management of drilling fluids, and protection of natural resources including local beaches, species, and water resources. In the near term, the MWRA may introduce the proposed work to the applicable agencies of jurisdiction to open communications and receive preliminary feedback. • CON-001: Conflict with Obstruction - If the drill bit, reamer, or product pipe cannot be advanced past an obstruction, even by backing up and trying to steer around it, the impact can be significant. Typical obstructions include cobbles, boulders, wood, construction debris, and foundations. Along the proposed HDD alignment, there is potential to encounter any of these types of obstructions. In the extreme case, the HDD borehole may need to be abandoned and a new borehole drilled. Also, frac out along the piles, fouling of drilling fluids with suspended wood fibers, and impeding of forward progress is possible. Wood fibers could affect performance of the mud pumps or otherwise damage them. If an unknown obstruction is encountered during construction, the steering head can be pulled back and guided around the obstacle during pilot hole drilling, provided the change in alignment will not adversely impact pipe pullback. Execute contingency plan for mitigating inadvertent release of drilling fluids to environment (see below). The Route #7 alignment, at it’s angle to seawall, increases likelihood of conflict with the seawall piles, and reduces likelihood that course adjustment will be able to remedy a conflict. Also, the location where Route #7 enters Revere is estimated to have a higher probability to encounter unknown historic piers associated with maritime activity. • CON-002: Inadvertent Return of Drilling Fluids to the Environment - Inadvertent return of drilling fluid to the environment may be characterized as a “fracout” or a “hydrofracture”. “Frac out” refers to an event where drilling fluid is released during drilling through a preferential seepage path along piers, piles, loose gravel, rocks or improperly backfilled test borings. “Hydrofracture” refers to an event where drilling fluid pressure overcomes the overburden pressure to release into the environment. Inadvertent returns are typically encountered where the ground cover is low such as near the entry and exit pits and drilling fluid pressures are high. The consequence of realizing the risk includes release of drilling fluids to the environment, possible curtailing of drilling operations, possible cost and schedule implications of required approach adjustment and clean-up. The risk of inadvertent returns can be mitigated by providing sufficient ground cover, attentiveness to drill advance rates, proper drill fluid design and circulation, installing \"starter\" casings near the entry and exit pits to confine the drilling fluid. Subsurface exploration should inform design to limit risk of hydrofracture under the river due to insufficient depth. • CON-013: Abutter Concerns - The risk includes that abutter concerns result in vocal opponents of the project during construction. The consequence of realizing the risk is that abutter concerns result in poor public opinion of the project and delays as executive issues are addressed. To mitigate, public participation conferences may be conducted in design, pre-construction, and during construction to provide venue to hear, acknowledge, and address abutter concerns. The construction contract may also include work-hour, noise, and sequence provisions to minimize impact to abutters during construction. 7-7 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 7.5 Cost Estimate Detailed program cost estimates were prepared for Route 3 and Route 7. Detailed estimates were prepared for use establishing a program budget, therefore accuracy was critical. The approach to estimation included solicitation of price quotes from suppliers and contractors where appropriate, and modeling equipment and labor expense based on task durations outlined in Section 7.6 of this Report. The detailed tabulation of estimated program costs, as well as statement of assumptions and price backup, is attached as Appendix R. The estimates included construction, engineering, land acquisition and easements, engineering, and contingency costs: • Engineering expense included contract professional services furnished for engineering design, construction administration, and resident representation. Engineering design included subsurface exploration, survey and base map, design, permitting, and bidding. The scope and cost for subsurface exploration is detailed in Section 7.7 of this report, and is estimated at 5.5% of construction cost. Survey and base map includes land and marine survey activities plus development of a detailed base map, and is estimated at 2% of construction cost. Design includes preliminary and final design activities and is estimated at 3% of construction cost. Permitting includes acquisition of permits described in Section 7.3, and is estimated at 1% of construction cost. Bidding includes support from preparation of the final bid documents through recommendation to award of a construction contract, and is estimated at 0.5% of construction cost. Construction Administration is estimated at 5% of construction cost, and resident engineer expense is estimated at 10% of construction cost. The allocation for resident engineering was confirmed adequate to support one senior resident engineer and one junior resident engineer throughout the construction period. The ratio engineering to construction expense is 27%. • Land Acquisition and Easements was estimated as described in Section 5.1, and as detailed in Appendix K. The value of easements was estimated based on land value and estimated reduction in beneficial use, not a percent of construction cost. • Construction cost estimates were based on general contractor costs extended from task durations, estimated labor/equipment resource application by task, and applicable labor/equipment rates. Quotes were secured for supply and specialty subcontractors costs. Task durations were generally per typical production rates published for operations of this length and pipe diameter. These task durations were confirmed with a qualified HDD contractor from Houston Texas. General Contractor labor and equipment resource application, and overhead expenses, were gathered from discussions with qualified Massachusetts general contractors. General contractor labor estimates accounted-for periods requiring continuous (24-hour), and typical (8-hour), operations, as well as varying labor demands by task (full 6-person crew, or reduced 3-person crew). Labor rates were per Massachusetts Prevailing Wage. Equipment rental and operating costs were from Equipment Watch Blue Book rates. Supply costs were secured via quote from qualified supply contractors. The estimate provides for upsizing the Section 56 crossing of the Saugus River to 30” diameter, as requested by the MWRA. The estimate carries fusible PVC pipe for HDD river crossing and ductile iron pipe for open trench installation on-land. Weston & Sampson believes that the program estimate is sufficiently conservative to support selection of an alternative HDD pipe material if preferred in preliminary design, as described further in Section 7.8. Spoils disposal assumes 50% will be disposed or reused at an in-state landfill, and 50% will be disposed or reused at an out-of-state landfill. Uniformed officers for traffic control are included. 7-8 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY • Contingency is included in the sum of twenty five percent (25%) of estimated construction, engineering, and land acquisition expense, per the MWRA’s recommendations for feasibility study cost estimation. The estimate is per March 2017 construction costs. The Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index (Boston) associated with this period is 13,710.37. A summary of the program cost estimate for Route 3 is presented in Table 9. A summary of the program cost estimate for Route 7 is presented in Table 10. Description Value Construction $6,347,180 Land Acquisition & Easements $460,000 Engineering $1,713,738 Contingency (25%) $2,130,229 Grand Total: $10,651,147 Table 9 - Program Cost Estimate Route 3 Description Value Item 1 - Construction $5,884,093 Item 2 - Land Acquisition & Easements $485,000 Item 3 - Engineering $1,588,705 Item 4 – Contingency (25%) $1,989,449 Grand Total: $9,947,248 Table 10 - Program Cost Estimate Route 7 All installed pipe, fittings, and appurtenance are anticipated to have a useful life of greater than 30-years. Cathodic protection systems may require replacement over the lifecycle period, however the cost for this replacement is unsubstantial compared to overall project capital costs. Therefore, this review assumes that no substantial maintenance of the system will be required for the 30-year capital analysis period. 7.6 Schedule Estimate Detailed schedule estimates were prepared for Route 3 and Route 7. Schedule estimation included identification of program tasks, defining sequence dependencies, and estimating duration required of tasks. Task duration assumptions were based on HDD design literature and discussion with qualified service providers. Project schedules, prepared in Microsoft Project, are attached as Appendix S. Notes describing the basis for construction duration, sequence, and seasonal restrictions are also included in Appendix S. Schedule tasks included Procurement of a Consultant, Preliminary Design, Final Design, Permitting, Bid Ready Documents, Land Acquisition and Easements, Bidding and Award, and Construction. • Procurement of a Consultant will result in securing contract engineering services from a consultant. 9-months have been allowed for procurement of a consultant. • Preliminary Design was typically estimated to require 10-months, and will include survey, subsurface exploration, base map development, a preliminary design report, and preliminary 7-9 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY design plans and specification. A period for MWRA review and comment was included. Preliminary design is the first phase of contract engineering services. • Final Design includes a complete engineered set of contract drawings and contract specification. Weston & Sampson assumed that Final Design activities would begin immediately after MWRA acceptance of the Preliminary Design Report. A period for MWRA review was allowed. Final Design is estimated to require 5-months. • Bid Ready Documents incorporate revisions and requirements identified through Permitting, Land Acquisition, and stakeholder engagement. Bid Ready Documents were estimated to require 5-months and conclude 2-months following completion of Permitting. • Permitting was estimated to begin after Preliminary Design documents are reviewed, approved, and amended. The duration of the Permitting period was 11-months. The Mass DEP Chapter 91 permit was the driver of the permitting duration (9-months to process) and was sequenced after securing Conservation Commission Order of Conditions. • Land Acquisition and Easements involves negotiation of easements with project area land owners. Abutters should also be canvassed during this period. Land Acquisition and Easements should begin as soon as practical, therefore it is modeled to begin before completion of Procurement of a Consultant. The task will conclude after completing the Geotechnical, Hazardous Materials, Environmental, and Corrosion Investigation. Land Acquisition and Easements is allowed 12-months. • Bidding and Award is estimated to require 6-months. This task will follow completion of all other tasks, and result in a secured construction contractor. As constituted, the program schedule completes Bid Ready Documents too late in the 2020 season to provide for construction mobilization in 2020, therefore a 90-day period is provided between completion of Bid Ready Documents and Advertisement for Bid. Timing bid later in the season, and more proximate to the intended construction start, will result in greater interest from bidders. • Construction involves implementation of river crossing and on-land water main installation. Construction is the final phase of the project. Task duration was estimated as the sum of associated construction tasks, including mobilization, HDD river crossing pipe installation, open trench pipe installation, and surface restoration. Construction mobilization was estimated to require about 3-months. HDD site preparation was estimated to require about 42-days. HDD drilling operations were estimated to require about 14-days. HDD post-drilling operations were estimated to require about 45-days. Open trench pipe installation was estimated to require about 86-days for Route 3, and 64-days for Route 7. Given probable seasonal restrictions applicable to Route 3 work at the end of Point of Pines, it is estimated that open trench pipe installation will occur in the first half of the 2021, and HDD operations will occur in the second half of 2021. As Route 7 does not have this restriction, it is estimated that HDD will occur in the first half of the 2021, and open trench pipe installation will occur in the second half of 2021. Schedule estimates for Route 3 and Route 7 include design and permitting performed over a 24-month period from March 2018 to March 2020, and bidding and award over a 6-month period from June 2020 to December 2020. Land acquisition and easement negotiation is advised to begin as soon as practical and conclude early in design. Construction of Route 3 might be phased with pipe installation in Rice Avenue and Hanson Street in spring/summer 2021, directional drill performed in summer/fall 2021 (after a threatened bird species vacates the Point of Pines area), and surface restoration and finishing works in fall 2021. Route 3 requires construction operations from April 2021 through October 2021 to complete the scope of work (approximately 7-months). Construction of Route 7 might be phased with directional drill performed in spring 2021, pipe installation in Rice Avenue and Hanson Street in summer 2021, and 7-10 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY surface restoration in fall 2021. Route 7 requires construction operations from April 2021 through September 2021 to complete the scope of work (approximately 6-months). 7.7 Recommended Subsurface Exploration Design of an HDD installation requires reliable subsurface information along the installation route to depths sufficient to support project design and construction. Sufficient and reliable subsurface information is critical to limiting the risk of differing subsurface conditions claims during construction for protection of the interests of the project owner. The available subsurface information indicates the northern and southern land areas are formed of surficial fill layers of variable thickness and composition, overlying an organic soil layer, followed by a relatively thin sand layer and then marine clay with glacial till and bedrock. The river channel generally consists of a soft organic sediment layer of variable thickness overlying marine clay with glacial till and bedrock between 80 and 120 ft. below mudline. An investigation program is proposed to collect information to define subsurface soil conditions and identify potential for obstructions along Route 3 and Route 7 alignments. It should be noted that the recommendations presented herein are based on preliminary information. As design progresses, the recommendations should be refined appropriately. 7.7.1 Design-Phase Geotechnical Investigation Recommendations The issues to be addressed by subsurface explorations include: • Defining subsurface conditions at proposed entry and exit site locations for evaluating measures to limit risks of ground collapse, and drill fluid breakout, • Improving our understanding of subsurface conditions along potential HDD drill alignments and cut-and-cover pipeline installation alignments, • Clarifying conditions at potential HDD obstructions such as the Lynn seawall and Point-of-Pines seawall, and • Determining river bottom bathymetry and soft sediment thickness along the HDD alignments. The recommended geotechnical investigation program includes test borings, exploratory excavations, field soil index testing, and geotechnical laboratory testing as described below. HDD Bore Entry Site (Lynn Waterfront) One test boring should be drilled within the anticipated bore entry pit footprint. The entry pit footprint in this area is approximately the same for both Routes 3 and 7, so one test boring is considered sufficient. The boring should be advanced through surficial fill and organic soils using hollow stem auger drilling methods. Continuous split-spoon soil sampling should be conducted from ground surface through fill and organic soils until at least two samples are obtained in the underlying native marine clay. The remaining boring depth may be advanced using drive-and-wash casing methods with split-spoon sampling conducted through the marine clay at 5 ft. intervals of depth (standard sampling interval) until the boring encounters the underlying glacial till or bedrock. Completed boreholes should be fully backfilled by tremie grouting with cement-bentonite grout (5% cement mix). 7-11 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY A test pit excavation program should also be conducted to identify conditions at the Lynn seawall along both potential HDD routes. Available information suggests a timber bulkhead at the edge of land supported by battered piles and by horizontal tie rods connected to a deadman anchorage system approximately 30 ft. inland of the bulkhead. Lengths of piles are unknown but are likely to be between 40 and 60 ft. Depths, types and spacing of horizontal tie rods are unknown. In addition, the tie rod anchorage system type, geometry and component spacing are also unknown. The test pit excavation program should be designed and conducted to identify this type of information for inclusion on subsurface profiles so that potential interference with HDD installation can be assessed and measures designed to reduce the risk of interference during construction. Test pit excavations will need to comply with OSHA trenching regulations and should be backfilled to comply with the landowner’s requirements, which would be ascertained during final planning of the test boring and test excavation program. Assume two days in the field with a tracked excavator will be required to complete the excavation program. HDD Bore Exit Site (Revere Waterfront) One test boring should be conducted within the footprint of each conceptual bore exit pit location on the Revere waterfront side of the project (two test borings total). Each boring should be advanced through surficial fill and organic soils using hollow stem auger drilling methods. Continuous split-spoon soil sampling should be conducted from ground surface through fill and organic soils until at least two samples are obtained in the underlying native marine clay. The remaining boring depth should be advanced using drive-and-wash casing methods with split-spoon sampling conducted through the marine clay at 5 ft. intervals of depth (standard sampling interval) until the boring encounters the underlying glacial till or bedrock. Completed boreholes should be fully backfilled by tremie grouting with cement-bentonite grout (5% cement mix). The concrete seawall along the northern shore of the Point-of-Pines neighborhood likely has either a timber pile foundation or a boulder fill foundation. It is also possible there is no foundation other than native beach sand. In any event, the foundation conditions should be explored for potential interference with HDD installation as part of final design. A shallow test pit (3 to 4 ft. depth) along the land side of the blocks is recommended to access the foundation zone below the wall. Careful hand excavation below the wall from the test pit may be necessary to expose the foundation conditions. Assume one day of test pit excavation and documentation of condition will be required for this effort. Cut-and-Cover Alignments Test borings should be drilled along all cut-and-cover alignments at approximately 300 ft. spacing. The borings should be drilled using hollow-stem auger drilling methods with continuous split-spoon sampling to at least 20 ft. below grade. Completed boreholes should be fully backfilled with soil cuttings sealed with cold patch. HDD Alignments At least three test borings should be drilled along each potential HDD alignment (six test borings total) where they cross the mouth of the river. The borings should be advanced using drive-and-wash casing drilling methods from a barge-mounted drill rig. One boring should be located at approximately the center of the channel for each alignment. Two additional borings should be spaced along the remaining 7-12 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY water crossing portion of each alignment. Water boring locations should be offset approximately 20 ft. laterally from the anticipated HDD alignments. Continuous split-spoon samples should be collected from each boring within the upper 10 ft. below the river channel mudline to confirm the thickness and composition of soft sediments at each location. Thin wall tube samples (30-inch length) should be collected in the marine clay beginning at 10 ft. below mudline at 15 ft. to 20 ft. depth intervals, with split-spoon samples collected immediately before and after each tube sample and at 5 ft. depth intervals between tubes until the boring encounters glacial till or bedrock. Completed boreholes should be fully backfilled by tremie grouting with cement-bentonite grout (5% cement mix) to approximately 6 ft. below the mudline. The thin wall tube samples should be properly sealed with wax after conducting field index testing (i.e. pocket penetrometer testing, Torvane shear testing and field classification), and carefully delivered to a geotechnical laboratory for testing. Each tube sample should be opened in the laboratory, processed and tested for index properties including pocket penetrometer and Torvane testing, Atterberg limits, natural moisture content, specific gravity and unit weight determinations and grain size distribution analyses (including hydrometer analyses). It should be noted that project design should include detailed bathymetry of the river bottom and identification of the range of thickness and composition of soft sediments along the HDD alignment for evaluating minimum depth of cover for the entire alignment. This memorandum considers bathymetric sounding, sub-bottom profiling, and side-scan sonar as part of survey scope required for the project. As such, the estimated cost for those services is not included in the subtotals of Section 7.7.3, but rather in the detailed cost estimate allowance for “Survey and Basemap”. Geophysical survey for near surface obstructions (metallic objects, concrete/granite blocks) in the fill material near the HDD entry/exit area located in Lynn is included. 7.7.2 Design-Phase Environmental Investigation Recommendations Review of available files from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) identified several known state-listed disposal sites within or proximate to the Section 56 project area. The review also identified the presence of contaminated historical fill materials on the Lynn side of the Saugus River as well as a closed municipal landfill formerly operated by the City of Lynn north of the proposed HDD entry point on Hanson Street. Based on these findings, an environmental investigation should be conducted to evaluate soil and groundwater conditions and assess the extent of oil and hazardous materials (OHM) that may be encountered. The investigation should also be performed to obtain representative characterization data that will assist with soil and groundwater management planning and obtaining necessary approvals or permits from off-site soil disposal facilities or regulatory agencies overseeing groundwater treatment/discharge. The environmental investigation should be conducted concurrently with design-phase geotechnical investigations and include: • Field screening exposed soil samples for visual/olfactory evidence of contamination (i.e., staining, odors, etc.) and jar headspace using a photoionization detector (PID). • Installation of eight (8) groundwater monitoring wells to measure groundwater levels and characterize groundwater quality on the Lynn and Revere sides of the Saugus River; and • The collection of soil and groundwater samples for laboratory analysis. 7-13 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Soil and groundwater samples should be collected to representatively characterize materials that may be encountered during construction and facilitate future off-site disposal of surplus bore and excavation spoils. Specifically, soil samples should be collected from each boring, including those advanced along the HDD alignments beneath the Saugus River, at depth intervals corresponding to the anticipated depth of construction and analyzed for disposal characterization parameters in accordance with DEP’s COMM-97-001 Policy, “Reuse and Disposal of Contaminated Soil at Massachusetts Landfills”. Groundwater samples should be analyzed for all the parameters listed in Attachment III of EPA’s NPDES Remediation General Permit using the methods specified in RGP Attachment VI. 7.7.3 Subsurface Exploration Estimated Cost and Schedule Preliminary planning-level estimated ranges of costs for the explorations and laboratory testing described above, as well as the estimated engineering costs (i.e. program planning, permitting, monitoring, coordination, preparation of a geotechnical baseline report and project management) for the subsurface exploration and characterization are as follows: Description Cost Range Subsurface Explorations $ 90,000 to $110,000 Geophysics Survey $ 40,000 to $ 50,000 Geotechnical Laboratory Testing $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 Environmental Laboratory Testing $ 20,000 to $ 25,000 Geotechnical Engineering $155,000 to $180,000 Total Estimated Range: $320,000 to $385,000 From execution of contracts, the schedule for subsurface exploration is estimated as follows: Description Duration Planning, Permitting, and Coordination of Work 2-months Execution of Field Operations 1-month Laboratory Analysis 1-month Prepare Geotechnical Report 1-month Total Duration: 5-months 7.7.4 Required Permits for Subsurface Exploration Permits in the matrix related to dredging and construction in the waterway are not applicable to exploratory drilling with the purpose of sample collection (ie Army Corps 404, CZM Consistency Determination, Mass DEP Chapter 91, among others). NPDES is not applicable due to limited area impacted. As work is not being performed on the bridge, a Mass DOT Access Permit will not be required. Permits related to historic review are not applicable. The MWRA does not require their 8m Permit for exploratory borings, although they do look for notification to their permitting department. MA DEP regulation related to remedial wastes is not applicable.

This path will require a bore entry angle sufficient to pass under timber piles associated with the Lynn seawall, and steering sufficient to level the bore path in firmer blue clays above underlying softer clay and glacial till, while retaining sufficient depth of cover under the Saugus River bottom. Space for drill entry staging, and complete construction of the pipe string, appear to be available in privately parcels in the Lynn Harbor area provided easements can be secured. The Section 56 water main is in the MWRA’s High Pressure service zone which has a hydraulic grade line (HGL) of the 280 feet, relative Boston City Base (BCB) datum. At BCB elevation zero, which is approximately equivalent to mean low water level, working pressure based on HGL is estimated at 121 psi. With the proposed HDD pipe conceptually installed up to 50 feet below mean low water, the pipeline at the lowest-elevation point is estimated to have a working pressure of approximately 143 psi. During HDD installation pipe experiences a combination of tensile, bending, and compressive stresses. These installation forces must be accounted for individually and in combination. They are significantly impacted by the installation alignment, borehole conditions, and fluid conditions. In addition to installation forces, pre-installation forces and operating stresses need to be considered. Often in long installations the installation stresses can exceed the operating stresses and become the determining factor in pipe dimension design. Pipe dimension selection should be calculated during the design phase of the project based on the design pipe route and subsurface conditions. Any reference to specific pipe thickness classes or dimension ratios herein are provided for comparison purposes per vendor rule of thumb estimation based on conceptual route length, depth, and operating pressure, and will vary from actual requirements to be identified in design. Typical pipe materials used in HDD include steel, ductile iron (“DI”), high density polyethylene (“HDPE”), and fusible polyvinyl chloride (“FPVC”). These materials were screened for comparative advantage and disadvantage Section 4.7 of this report. In general plastic pipes (HDPE and FPVC) were identified as more advantageous than metal pipe (steel and DI) due to corrosion resistance, advantageous hydraulics throughout pipe lifecycle, and reduced installed costs. Where metal pipes will rely on coatings, encasement, and cathodic protection to reduce internal and external corrosion, plastic pipes do not similarly corrode in typical soil conditions. The interior profile of fused plastic pipes is smooth, and does not accumulate tuberculation on the interior. Supply cost of plastic pipe is typically less than metal pipe, and installation cost is generally less due to reduced product weight and ease of handling. 7-15 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Jointing of pipe is critical in a HDD application. HDPE, FPVC, and Steel in HDD application would utilize continuously fused or welded joints. DI in HDD application would utilize restrained joints. Most restrained joint systems have bells which protrude and effectively increase the outside diameter of the installed pipe system, which increases bore diameter. Restrained joint DI pipe systems are often used in HDD installations where space limitations preclude assembly of a complete pipe string. One-joint-at-a-time assembly of restrained joints is referred to as a “cartridge” installation method. Fused and welded joints, executed in a controlled environment, provide for great confidence in the viability of the joint, allow for ready testing, and eliminate reliance on ancillary materials, such as gaskets, for long term pipeline integrity. HDPE, FPVC, and steel, are available in standard size and material characteristics required of this potable water application. FPVC pipe of the size required by this project is specified for potable water use in ANSI/AWWA C900-16 Standard for Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Pressure Pipe and Fabricated Fittings, 4-In Through 60-In (recently superseded ANSI/AWWA C905). HDPE pipe for of the size required by this project is specified for potable water use in ANSI/AWWA C906 Polyethylene (PE) Pressure Pipe and Fittings. Underground Solutions is the sole manufacturer of their patented/proprietary fusible PVC pipe system. Their “Fusible C-905” fusible PVC pipe for potable water is available in pipe sizes 14” to 36” in a variety of standard Dimension Ratios (DR). HDPE potable water pipe and fusing systems are an open market with many manufacturers producing pipe of a broad range of sizes and dimension ratios. HDPE, FPVC, and steel have been used in numerous potable water HDD applications of same or larger diameter. Weston & Sampson summarizes herein key differences between pipe material alternatives FPVC, HDPE, and Steel, as they relate to HDD: • As summarized previously, FPVC and HDPE have greater corrosion resistance, advantageous hydraulics throughout lifecycle, and reduced installed costs compared to steel. Where steel will rely on coatings, wraps, and cathodic protection to reduce internal and external corrosion, plastic pipes do not similarly corrode in typical soil conditions. The interior profile of fused plastic pipes is smooth, and does not accumulate tuberculation on the interior. Supply cost of plastic pipe is typically less than metal pipe, and installation cost is generally less due to reduced product weight and ease of handling. • HDPE flexibility supports ease of installation. On land, the pipe string can be easily navigated around obstructions and oriented in-line with the bore path. For a 30” HDPE pipe, the minimum published radius of curvature is approximately 60-feet. For 30” FPVC it is approximately 670- feet. For 30” steel it is around 3,000-feet. FPVC pipe will require greater care to align bore path with pipe string orientation than HDPE, and steel will require significantly greater care to align relative both plastic options. Figures 1D and 2D, in Appendix O, demonstrate the maximum allowable radius of curvature overlaid on the Pipe String Staging area for Routes 3 and 7, respectively. In the bore hole, the maximum allowed deflection angle of drill rod joints will limit the radius of curvature practical of the bore hole. This will align the actual allowable bore-radius of curvature for HDPE to align more closely with that allowed by FPVC. • HDPE is resilient through the rigors of installation due to its wall thickness, tolerance for abrasion, and elasticity. Fusible PVC and steel will require greater care in handling. • Steel and FPVC have substantially greater stiffness than HDPE, which contributes to better resisting of external loads, such as earth loading should the bore hole collapse. Steel has substantially greater stiffness than each FPVC and HDPE. Estimated loadings on pipe will 7-16 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY require detailed review during design. At this time, it appears that each alternative can each be engineered to adequately accommodate anticipated loads. • HDPE and steel have better resistance to recurring surge pressures than FPVC for comparable pressure class pipe. AWWA C905 requires FPVC pipe to sustain an occasional surge pressure 1.6 times maximum working pressure rating, but does not provide for additional allowance for recurring surge pressures. AWWA C906 requires HDPE pipe to sustain an occasional surge pressure 2 times maximum working pressure rating, and 1.5 times maximum working pressure for recurring surge pressures. The design team should consider whether the Section 56 pipeline is likely to be subject to recurring surge pressures. • Some studies indicate that HDPE has inferior resistance to hydrocarbon permeability and chlorine induced oxidation. These risks may be limited given the actual subsurface conditions and wall thickness that will be required of HDD pipe installation. Each risk can be assessed during pipe selection in Preliminary Design. • FPVC has a density of 1.40, which means it will sink in most aqueous solutions, reducing friction on the top of the bore hold due to floating of the pipe. HDPE pipe has a specific gravity of 0.95 and will float in an aqueous solution. In HDD application, a floating pipe incurs friction with the top of the bore hole and increase pulling force required. • FPVC and steel have reduced wall thickness compared to HDPE, which means a smaller bore hole is required to install the same inside-dimension pipe. A larger bore diameter means additional reaming duration, additional drilling fluids required, and additional material disposal expense. Risks and expense increase with increased bore hole diameter. • HDPE and steel are more resilient to cold temperatures during installation. FPVC becomes brittle in cold temperatures and it is not advised that it be installed in winter weather temperatures. Pipe fusing and installation would need to be coordinated for a period with low risk of freezing temperatures. • FPVC and steel expand and contract less than HDPE from temperature variation and pipe stresses. This will facilitate connection of FPVC and steel to existing buried pipe at the HDD extents. Typical pipe materials used in HDD include steel, DI, HDPE, and FPVC. Final pipe material selection should be determined in the design phase of the project based on detailed evaluation of existing conditions, design stresses, and required alignment geometry. Cost estimates for Route 3 and Route 7 in Section 7.5 carry FPVC. The cost for steel and ductile iron pipe installation will be greater than FPVC. The cost for HDPE pipe installation is approximately equivalent to FPVC, and will vary depending on the dimension ratio identified required in Preliminary Design. O:\\MWRA\\2150821-Bridge Crossing FS\\C7500 File\\13 Subtasks\\3.3 Final Feasibility Study\\Feasibility Study Final Report.docx 7-17 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 8.0 CONCLUSIONS Inspection revealed that the existing Section 56 water main supported on the General Edwards Bridge is in poor to serious condition. Typical pitting on the exterior of the water main was 0.125 to 0.25 inches deep. Three (3) locations of previous pipe blowout were observed. The tower portions of the pipe were not visible for inspection due to existing insulation. Pipe extending to tunnel shafts, as well as at the top of each tunnel shaft, was observed in poor condition. Many pipe supports were observed in poor condition. The General Edwards Bridge is over 80-years old and currently rated “structurally deficient”. The water main in its existing location is exposed to risk from weather, as evidenced by current condition, and from human activities, as indicated by extensive graffiti on the water main at the north bridge abutment. Routes for river crossing were reviewed from the Saugus River confluence with the Pines River to the west, through the mouth of the Saugus River at Lynn Harbor to the east. Installation methods including open trench river crossing, horizontal directional drilling, microtunneling, and removal and replacement on the bridge were considered. River crossing routes alternatives can generally be grouped in one of four geographic areas relative to the existing bridge: • On Bridge (Route 8): Installed under the bridge and in a tunnel, in an alignment approximately congruous that of the existing water main. • Abutting the Bridge (Route 4, Route 5): Included routes immediately adjacent to the existing bridge corridor. This area provided for more direct route alignments, but incurred substantial risk of encountering piles associated with existing and historic structures in the area, including those associated with historic docks and piers, the existing railroad bridge, the demolished historic bridge, the General Edwards Bridge, and fenders associated with each historic bridge structure. • West of Bridge (Route 6): Included routes to the west of the bridge corridor. This area required long trenchless pipe installation lengths, substantial over land pipe installation, and encountered sensitive environmental receptors, developer interests, and local interests. • East of the Bridge (Route 1, Route 2, Route 3, Route 7): Included routes to the east of the bridge corridor. This area provided accessible paths for open trench and microtunneling pipe installation at a modest distance from the bridge. Space constraints between the shore and a proposed development required HDD to be shifted farther east to find adequate space for staging areas and pipe string construction. River crossings to the far east required longer river crossing and on-land pipe installation, but provided reduced risk of encountering historic obstructions and foundation structures of the Lynn Seawall. Each alternative was evaluated with respect to finished “pipeline performance” and “program risks”. Pipeline performance criteria included Access for Maintenance, Protection Against Damage, and Hydraulics, and program risks criteria included Permitting Approval Difficulty, Technical Complexity, Construction Risk, Environmental Risk, Impact on Abutters & Motorists, Easements & Land Acquisition, and MassDOT/DCR Support. Route alternatives were evaluated against criteria and assigned a score of one to five. The sum of ratings applied to pipeline performance and program risks criteria became the composite, or total, rating. Program cost and program schedule were estimated for each alternative. 8-1 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Horizontal directional drill pipe installation from Hanson Street, in the City of Lynn, to Rice Avenue, in the City of Revere, provided for the two most highly ranked alternatives (Route 3 and Route 7). The microtunneling alternative was rated favorably from a performance and risk perspective, but had the highest cost and a longer schedule duration. The open trench river crossing alternative was comparable in cost to HDD options, but included greater environmental risk, greater permitting difficulty, and a longer schedule duration. The alternative for pipe replacement on the bridge scored less favorably due to reduced protection against damage, hydraulic limitations, greater technical complexity, and greater construction risk. The two highly ranked horizontal directional drill routes each propose drill entry and pipe string construction from near Hanson Street in Lynn, but differ in their location of drill exit. Drill exit for Route 3 is near the end of the Point of Pines on Rice Avenue, and for Route 7 it is near the Point of Pines Yacht Club just off Rice Avenue. A focused comparison factors differentiating Route 3 and Route 7 is presented in Table 11. Table 11 – Comparison of Route 3 and Route 7 (Part 1) Criteria Route 3 Route 7 Pipe Length Requires a longer over-land pipe Requires a shorter over-land pipe installation (1,700-ft in Revere and 1,200- installation (500ft in Revere and 1,200-ft in ft in Lynn) and a shorter river-crossing Lynn) and a longer river-crossing (2,700- (2,500-ft). ft).

Weston & Sampson recommends that both Route 3 and Route 7 be carried forward into preliminary design for further evaluation. As detailed in Appendix Q, risks associated with obstruction by the seawall (DES-009, CON-001, CON-002), easement acquisition (DES-005, DES-006), and abutter concerns (DES-001, DES-002, DES-003, DES-004, CON- 013) will be better understood in preliminary design after execution of the recommended subsurface exploration program, engagement of abutters, and initiation of access/easement negotiation. The additional subsurface exploration required to evaluate two alternatives includes four additional borings and one additional test pit, so overall additional resource expenditure is modest. Using the preferred Route 3 program cost and schedule for program capital planning will secure a more conservative budgetary cost and schedule estimate. Each route will require land access/acquisition agreements and/or easements to provide for construction access and pipeline occupation. A summary of easement requirements is presented in Table 12. 8-3 westonandsampson.comMASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Additional Easement Type Map Parcel ID Owner Location Description Route 3 Route 7 034-752-077 WMI Lynn LLC (O'Donnell) Riley Way Permanent & Temporary 034-752-075 Massachusetts Electric Co (National Grid) Riley Way Temporary 050-752-055 Massachusetts Electric Co (National Grid) Riley Way Temporary 033-752-065 City of Lynn Marine Blvd Permanent 034-759-003 Capri Lynn Properties Ltd (Walmart) 780 Lynnway Temporary Permanent & (unknown) City of Revere (Pump Station) Rice Ave (N/A) Temporary 14-192O-14A Point of Pines Yacht Club 28 Rice Ave (N/A) Temporary Point of Pines Beach 14-192O-23 Association Inc Rice Ave Permanent (N/A) Table 12 – Probable Land Acquisition and Easements Routes 3 and 7 Schedule estimates for Route 3 and Route 7 include design and permitting performed over a 24-month period from March 2018 to March 2020, and bidding and award over a 6-month period from June 2020 to December 2020. Land acquisition and easement negotiation is advised to begin as soon as practical and conclude early in design. Construction of Route 3 might be phased with pipe installation in Rice Avenue and Hanson Street in spring/summer 2021, directional drill performed in summer/fall 2021 (after a threatened bird species vacates the Point of Pines area), and surface restoration and finishing works in fall 2021. Route 3 requires construction operations from April 2021 through October 2021 to complete the scope of work (approximately 7-months). Construction of Route 7 might be phased with directional drill performed in spring 2021, pipe installation in Rice Avenue and Hanson Street in summer 2021, and surface restoration in fall 2021. Route 7 requires construction operations from April 2021 through September 2021 to complete the scope of work (approximately 6-months). In conclusion, Weston & Sampson recommends abandoning the existing Section 56 crossing of the Saugus River and replacing it with a new river crossing, installed via horizontal directional drill, from Hanson Street in Lynn to Rice Avenue in Revere. Route 3 and Route 7 should be carried forward into preliminary design. Preliminary design activities should advance understanding of risks associated with obstructions, abutter concerns, and easements, and facilitate route selection. Open cut pipe installation will be required on land to connect the new river crossing to the existing Section 56 water main in the Lynnway. Route 3 has an estimated program cost of $10,651,147 (March 2017 ENR Boston CCI 13,710.37), requires 7-months of construction operations, and has an estimated project substantial completion date in October 2021. Route 7 has an estimated program cost of $9,947,248, requires 6- months of construction operations, and has an estimated project substantial completion date in September 2021.

        "GENERAL PROJECT INFORMATION – all proponents must fill out this section PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Describe the existing conditions and land uses on the project site: The Section 56 Pipeline Replacement is proposed to cross the Saugus River between Lynn and Revere. The proposed horizontal directional drill (HDD) route lies west (seaward) of the General Edwards Memorial Bridge. The project site that would facilitate the HDD in Lynn is located along the Lynn Harbor shoreline on filled tidelands and is a capped landfill. This site is predominately barren due to activities associated with the landfill. The parcel in Revere is a yacht club located in a residential neighborhood. The club’s parking lot would be used as the HDD exit site. Describe the proposed project and its programmatic and physical elements: MWRA's Section 56 Water Pipeline helps provide water to portions of Lynn, Lynnfield, Marblehead, Nahant, Peabody, Revere, Saugus, and Swampscott. The section of this water pipeline to be replaced was previously attached to the General Edwards Bridge over the Saugus River (which is also Lynn/Revere municipal border), but had to be removed in 2018 due to severe corrosion. MWRA now proposes to replace this section of water pipeline by installing a new section in the ground under the water of the Saugus River. This project will ensure water system redundancy and reliability for residents and businesses in these communities, which is crucial to protecting public and environmental health. This project involves the installation of approximately 4,800 feet of water pipeline, using both open-cut and trenchless underwater pipeline construction methods. Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) will be used to install the water pipeline in the ground under the water at the of mouth of Saugus River, from points in Lynn and Revere. HDD is a trenchless method of installing underground utilities particularly suited for installing pipeline beneath obstructions and minimizing surface impacts. A hole is drilled in a relatively shallow arc within which the pipe is subsequently inserted. Additional pipeline will be installed in existing roadways and paved areas in Lynn and Revere using open-cut methods to connect the underwater portion of the replacement pipeline to MWRA's existing Section 56 pipeline alignment, located in Route 1A. The objective of the project is to install a replacement water main. HDD has been selected due to its minimal surface impacts and lack of permanent alterations to the project site. The major components of the project are as follows: • Installation of 20-inch diameter water main and appurtenances, including fittings, valves, air release valves, and blow-offs in Hanson Street in Lynn, from the existing Section 56 pipeline in Route 1A to the Saugus River HDD crossing point. • Installation of a 20-inch water main (HDD Route 7) under the Saugus River using HDD methods. The HDD section of the water main is approximately 2,800 feet long. • Installation of 20-inch water main including fittings, valves, air release valves, and blow- offs in Rice Avenue in Revere, from the Saugus River HDD crossing point at the Point of Pines Yacht Club (HDD Route 7) to the existing Section 56 pipeline between the Route 1A northbound onramp and the Lynnway. • All other required work during construction, including but not limited to environmental controls, traffic management, replacement of utilities, surface restoration, road reconstruction and pavement restoration, and sidewalk reconstruction. The project is anticipated to take twelve months and is limited to the geographic extent shown in Figure 1 in Attachment A. Please see Attachment A, Section 2, for further details on the - 4 -",
        "project and its programmatic and physical elements. Please see Attachment A, Section 5, for a discussion of the project’s direct and indirect impacts. NOTE: The project description should summarize both the project’s direct and indirect impacts (including construction period impacts) in terms of their magnitude, geographic extent, duration and frequency, and reversibility, as applicable. It should also discuss the infrastructure requirements. of the project and the capacity of the municipal and/or regional infrastructure to sustain these requirements into the future. Describe the on-site project alternatives (and alternative off-site locations, if applicable) considered by the proponent, including at least one feasible alternative that is allowed under current zoning, and the reasons(s) that they were not selected as the preferred alternative: The following project alternatives were considered by the proponent during the June 2017 Feasibility Study for Section 56 General Edwards Bridge Crossing of the Saugus River. Please see Attachment M for the Feasibility Study and the Route Selection Matrix. • A “No Action” alternative would result in the Section 56 pipeline remaining out of service. This pipeline provides a necessary redundancy in the water supply system, and without it, the MWRA Northern High Service Zone is vulnerable to failure. As a result, the No-Action alternative was dismissed. • Open trench river crossing: The open trench river crossing alternative was comparable in cost to HDD options but included greater environmental risk, greater permitting difficulty, and longer schedule duration and was thus abandoned. • Microtunneling: The microtunneling alternative was rated favorably from a performance and risk perspective but was ultimately abandoned due to having the highest cost and longer schedule duration. • Removal and replacement on the General Edwards Bridge: The pipe replacement on the bridge alternative scored less favorably due to reduced protection against damage, hydraulic limitations, greater technical complexity, and greater construction risk. Additionally, the General Edwards Bridge is deemed structurally deficient by MassDOT, and the Department is planning a replacement project for this 87-year-old structure. • Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD): HDD is a pipe installation method that involves drilling a guided borehole, referred to as the pilot hole, through the ground along a predetermined path from an entry point to an exit point. This method scored favorably due to lesser environmental risk, shorter scheduling duration, and greater protection against damage. • Eight potential route alignments were identified and screened with respect to pipeline performance, program risks, cost, and schedule. Of the eight routes and the four pipeline installation methods initially considered, two replacement pipeline alignments to be installed via horizontal directional drilling (HDD) construction were selected to progress for further evaluation during preliminary project design. Both alternatives extended from the eastern end of Hanson Street in Lynn to Rice Avenue in Revere. Following the geotechnical investigation, a preferred pipeline placement was identified (Route 7) due to the less disruptive impacts on residents in the Point of Pines neighborhood. The Route 7 Alternative was ultimately deemed the preferred alternative for the project and is presented as the proposed project in this EENF. NOTE: The purpose of the alternatives analysis is to consider what effect changing the parameters and/or siting of a project, or components thereof, will have on the environment, keeping in mind that the objective of the MEPA review process is to avoid or minimize damage to the environment to the greatest extent feasible. Examples of alternative projects include alternative site locations, alternative site uses, and alternative site configurations. Summarize the mitigation measures proposed to offset the impacts of the preferred alternative: - 5 -",
        "To offset the impacts of the project, the staging area has been designated in Lynn, rather than in Revere. This decision will minimize impacts to the surrounding community as the surronding area in Revere is in a residential neighborhood, while the staging area in Lynn is commercial and mostly vacant. An erosion and sediment control plan will be implemented. This program will minimize exposed soil areas through sequencing and temporary stabilization as necessary and use structural erosion and sedimentation controls, including erosion control barriers. Details of typical controls are illustrated in Attachment D. Waste materials, debris, and trash would be cleaned from the work site at the end of each day and placed in trash barrels and/or dumpsters which would be disposed of off-site. At no time during construction is the dumping of spoils material, waste, or other debris allowed into any wetland area or other unspecified location. General construction safety procedures would be followed to prevent accidents that could result in spills, releases, or other environmental damage. Activities such as fueling operations and hot work would be monitored and conducted away from sensitive resource areas. MWRA will work with the local communities to develop appropriate traffic management plans. Mitigation for dust would include watering down of the construction access road and vehicles, as needed, especially during especially windy and dry days. To minimize noise impacts during construction, best management practices (BMPs) would include the use of mufflers on construction equipment and vehicles. Construction activities would also be limited to daylight hours. MWRA will coordinate closely with the surrounding community, including landowners, businesses, and residents, before and throughout the duration of the project. MWRA will work to minimize short-term impacts from the project during construction to the maximum extent practicable. If the project is proposed to be constructed in phases, please describe each phase: It is not proposed to construct the project in phases. MWRA will coordinate closely with the surrounding community including landowners, businesses, and residents before and throughout the duration of the project. MWRA will work to minimize short-term impacts from the project during construction to the maximum extent practicable.

The Conceptual Site Model for the closed National Grid site is presented in Section 4.2 in the closure report (Permanent Solution Statement with No conditions) and states the following about soil impacts: “The results of the investigation activities indicate that PAHs and metals are present in soil, and are likely related to a combination of fill material (including remnants of the timber bulkhead and asphalt pavement for Riley Way Extension), the former landfill, and the history of industrial activities in the immediate vicinity of the site; there are other no apparent sources for these compounds.” - 7 -",
        "Lead was detected in a sample along Rice Avenue in Revere during the sediment investigation. Subsequent testing of the sample’s material composition indicated the following material detected: Coal (moderate), Coal Ash (moderate), Wood Ash (light), and Asphalt (trace). Per MassDEP, a background concentration for lead in soil containing coal ash or wood ash associated with fill material is 600 mg/kg. As the lead level detected in this sample was below 600 mg/kg, it was concluded that these lead levels can be attributable to fill and is exempt from reporting to MassDEP. During the groundwater investigation, dissolved lead was detected in a groundwater sample (20B-14MW) along a short stretch of Rice Avenue in Revere. The level detected is above Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) reportable concentration and constituted a 120-day reportable condition per the MCP (MWRA notified the property owner of the condition). Is there an Activity and Use Limitation (AUL) on any portion of the project site? Yes ___ No ; if yes, describe which portion of the site and how the project will be consistent with the AUL: _____________________. Are you aware of any Reportable Conditions at the property that have not yet been assigned an RTN?

The second is the removal of twelve timber piles, six of which are 70 feet deep and the other six are 68 feet deep. They are tapered and thus shaped as partial cones with an upper diameter of 2 feet and a lower diameter of 0.8 feet. Will dredging impact the following resource areas? Intertidal Yes __ No; if yes, 1,900 sqft Outstanding Resource Water __Yes No; if yes, ___ sq ft Other resource area (i.e. shellfish beds, eelgrass beds) Yes __No; if yes, 1,900 sqft (coincident with the intertidal area reported above) If yes to any of the above, have you evaluated appropriate and practicable steps to 1) avoidance; 2) if avoidance is not possible, minimization; 3) if either avoidance or minimize is not possible, mitigation? Alternatives included a no-action alternative wherein the Section 56 pipeline would remain out of service. As indicated above, this pipeline provides a necessary redundancy in the water supply system, and without it, the MWRA Northern High Service Zone is vulnerable to failure. As a result, the no-action alternative was dismissed. Various construction methods and nine routes were considered as alternatives, and two were selected for geotechnical investigation. The proposed HDD route is the least disruptive to adjacent resource areas. See Attachment A for further Alternatives Analysis. If no to any of the above, what information or documentation was used to support this determination? N/A Provide a comprehensive analysis of practicable alternatives for improvement dredging in accordance with 314 CMR 9.07(1)(b). Physical and chemical data of the sediment shall be included in the comprehensive analysis. Sediment Characterization Existing gradation analysis results? Yes ___No: if yes, provide results. Gradation results are included in Attachment J. Existing chemical results for parameters listed in 314 CMR 9.07(2)(b)6? ___Yes No; if yes, provide results.

        "sediment into soil and sand. These materials will be trucked off-site. The material is expected to be suitable for use as daily cover at a nearby landfill and this will be confirmed by sampling once the material is stockpiled as it is generated. It is not expected that contamination will be detected due to the depths of the sediments and distance from surface impacts. IV. Consistency: A. Does the project have effects on the coastal resources or uses, and/or is the project located within the Coastal Zone? Yes ___ No; if yes, describe these effects and the projects consistency with the policies of the Office of Coastal Zone Management: Coastal Hazards Policy #1: This policy concerns the protection of beneficial functions provided by natural coastal landforms. This project has been designed to limit permanent surface impacts to avoid impacting any coastal landforms. Returning Section 56 to service is a necessary task to protect the water supply system that serves thousands of residents. The HDD method described herein has been assessed and determined to be the most favorable alternative to minimize impact on coastal landforms. Coastal Hazards Policy #2: This policy concerns water circulation and sediment transport. This project will have no permanent impacts that would have an adverse effect on the project site or adjacent or downcoast areas. Coastal Hazards Policy #3: This policy concerns hazards presented by projects within the coastal zone. This project will have no permanent impacts that will exacerbate (or otherwise impact) existing hazards, nor promote growth in hazard-zone or buffer areas. Coastal Hazards Policy #4: This policy concerns the relocation of structures out of coastal high-hazard areas. This section of water main previously crossed the Saugus River on the General Edwards Bridge, which is a structure in a coastal high-hazard area that is scheduled to be replaced due to structural deficiency. MWRA understands that the bridge replacement is in the planning stages and will go to bid in 2028, putting construction into 2033 (with the potential of being delayed further). The replacement of the water main via HDD methods prevents a future replacement from being built above ground in the coastal high-hazard area and thus is aligned with this policy. B. Is the project located within an area subject to a Municipal Harbor Plan? Yes __ No; if yes, identify the Municipal Harbor Plan and describe the project’s consistency with that plan: The project area is located within the area subject to the Lynn Harbor Plan [1]. Central to the Lynn Harbor Plan is the signature public waterfront park (Lynn Harbor Park), and the goal of transitioning the Lynn waterfront to a new, mixed-use neighborhood. This project will ensure water supply system redundancy and resiliency for this public park, new residences, and businesses. Permanent impacts of the project will not impair public access to areas within the water-dependent use zone. 1 https://www.lynnma.gov/cityhall_documents/planning/harbor_plan/Lynn_Municipal_Harbor_Plan_2020.pdf - 17 -",

        "CLIM ATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY SECTION This section of the Environmental Notification Form (ENF) solicits information and disclosures related to climate change adaptation and resiliency, in accordance with the MEPA Interim Protocol on Climate Change Adaptation and Resiliency (the “MEPA Interim Protocol”), effective October 1, 2021. The Interim Protocol builds on the analysis and recommendations of the 2018 Massachusetts Integrated State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP), and incorporates the efforts of the Resilient Massachusetts Action Team (RMAT), the inter-agency steering committee responsible for implementation, monitoring, and maintenance of the SHMCAP, including the “Climate Resilience Design Standards and Guidelines” project. The RMAT team recently released the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool, which is available here. The MEPA Interim Protocol is intended to gather project-level data in a standardized manner that will both inform the MEPA review process and assist the RMAT team in evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool. Once this testing process is completed, the MEPA Office anticipates developing a formal Climate Change Adaptation and Resiliency Policy through a public stakeholder process. Questions about the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool can be directed to rmat@mass.gov. All Proponents must complete the following section, referencing as appropriate the results of the output report generated by the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool and attached to the ENF. In completing this section, Proponents are encouraged, but not required at this time, to utilize the recommended design standards and associated Tier 1/2/3 methodologies outlined in the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool to analyze the project design. However, Proponents are requested to respond to a respond to a user feedback survey on the RMAT website or to provide feedback to rmat@mass.gov, which will be used by the RMAT team to further refine the tool. Proponents are also encouraged to consult general guidance and best practices as described in the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Guidelines. I. Climate Change Adaptation and Resiliency Strategies Has the project taken measures to adapt to climate change for all of the climate parameters analyzed in the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool (sea level rise/storm surge, extreme precipitation (urban or riverine flooding), extreme heat)? Yes ___ No Note: Climate adaptation and resiliency strategies include actions that seek to reduce vulnerability to anticipated climate risks and improve resiliency for future climate conditions. Examples of climate adaptation and resiliency strategies include flood barriers, increased stormwater infiltration, living shorelines, elevated infrastructure, increased tree canopy, etc. Projects should address any planning priorities identified by the affected municipality through the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) program or other planning efforts, and should consider a flexible adaptive pathways approach, an adaptation best practice that encourages design strategies that adapt over time to respond to changing climate conditions. General guidance and best practices for designing for climate risk are described in the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Guidelines. A. If no, explain why. B. If yes, describe the measures the project will take, including identifying the planning horizon and climate data used in designing project components.

        "no new impervious surface proposed. The portion of the pipeline below the Saugus River is greater than forty feet below the riverbed, and the connecting land portions of the pipeline are also below-grade predominantly in existing paved areas. Therefore, it is not anticipated that consideration of climate data is relevant in the proposed project. While the RMAT Climate Design Standards Tool was consulted, there are no applicable design recommendations that can be incorporated into this project. C. Is the project contributing to regional adaptation strategies? __ Yes No; If yes, describe. II. Has the Proponent considered alternative locations for the project in light of climate change risks? ___ Yes No A. If no, explain why. The project is a replacement of an existing water main that traversed the Saugus River between Lynn and Revere. No alternative location would meet the project objective. B. If yes, describe alternatives considered. III. Is the project located in Land Subject to Coastal Storm Flowage (LSCSF) or Bordering Land Subject to Flooding (BLSF) as defined in the Wetlands Protection Act? Yes ____No If yes, describe how/whether proposed changes to the site’s topography (including the addition of fill) will result in changes to floodwater flow paths and/or velocities that could impact adjacent properties or the functioning of the floodplain. General guidance on providing this analysis can be found in the CZM/MassDEP Coastal Wetlands Manual, available here. The only change in topography at the site is the removal of twelve timber piles from the dilapidated sea wall along the shoreline in Lynn. The deteriorating seawall does not offer the adjacent BLSF significant protection and the removal of this section is not anticipated to change floodwater flow paths and/or velocities. There are no other permanent proposed changes to the site’s topographies. 29",
        "ENV IRONMENTAL JUSTICE SECTION I. Identifying Characteristics of EJ Populations A. If an Environmental Justice (EJ) population has been identified as located in whole or in part within 5 miles of the project site, describe the characteristics of each EJ population as identified in the EJ Maps Viewer (i.e., the census block group identification number and EJ characteristics of “Minority,” “Minority and Income,” etc.). Provide a breakdown of those EJ populations within 1 mile of the project site, and those within 5 miles of the site. There are three municipalities within a 1-mile radius of the project site. These are Lynn, Revere, and Saugus. Within a 1-mile radius of the project site, there are 31 EJ block groups across three municipalities (Lynn, Revere, and Saugus). The project site is located within two block groups designated as environmental justice popultions in Lynn and Revere. One is on the basis of income and one on the basis of minority. There are 29 additional block groups designated as environmental justice populations either in whole or in part within the designated geographic area (i.e. within one mile of the project). A figure in Attachment I indicates the EJ criteria for each block group. Within a 5-mile radius, there are 255 EJ block groups across twelve municipalities (Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Lynn, Malden, Melrose, Peabody, Revere, Salem, Saugus, Swampscott, and Winthrop). A list of these populations is included in Attachment I. B. Identify all languages identified in the “Languages Spoken in Massachusetts” tab of the EJ Maps Viewer as spoken by 5 percent or more of the EJ population who also identify as not speaking English “very well.” The languages should be identified for each census tract located in whole or in part within 1 mile and 5 miles of the project site, regardless of whether such census tract contains any designated EJ populations. Within a 1-mile radius of the project site, there are five EJ block groups that meet this qualification (four in Lynn and one in Revere). The languages spoken are Spanish or Spanish Creole, Russian, Mon-Khmer Cambodian, and “Other Indic Language.” Within a 5-mile radius, there are 52 EJ block groups across eight municipalities that meet this qualification. Lists of these block groups are included as Attachment I. C. If the list of languages identified under Section I.B. has been modified with approval of the EEA EJ Director, provide a list of approved languages that the project will use to provide public involvement opportunities during the course of MEPA review. If the list has been expanded by the Proponent (without input from the EEA EJ Director), provide a list of the additional languages that will be used to provide public involvement opportunities during the course of MEPA review as required by Part II of the MEPA Public Involvement Protocol for Environmental Justice Populations (“MEPA EJ Public Involvement Protocol”). If the project is exempt from Part II of the protocol, please specify. In order to meet the needs of the “Other Indic Languages” category, the EJ Screening Form was translated into Urdu. Translated forms in all five languages (English, Spanish, Russian, Mon-Khmer Cambodian, and Urdu) were distributed to the CBO Distribution List, as well as the project municipalities and their Conservation Commissions and other stakeholders identified by MWRA. 30",
        "IV. Potential Effects on EJ Populations A. If an EJ population has been identified using the EJ Maps Viewer within 1 mile of the project site, describe the likely effects of the project (both adverse and beneficial) on the identified EJ population(s). The following impacts may affect EJ populations as well as the wider public: • Short-term impacts to traffic on Rice Avenue would impact residents on this street during the terrestrial pipeline installation. Increased activity in the vicinity of the project site, including the Point of Pines parking lot, would temporarily disrupt local traffic. • Short-term impacts to traffic on Hanson Street would impact traffic patterns in the commercial/industrial vicinity during the terrestrial pipeline installation. • Short-term impacts to air quality in the project area could result from the temporary operation of machinery associated with construction activities. Best management practices (BMPs) to control construction emissions would be implemented to minimize visible fugitive dust emissions at the property line. • Short-term impacts to noise levels in the project area would occur during construction, primarily from mechanical equipment used for construction activities. • Short-term impacts to the accessibility to what is named on Google Maps as “The Community Path of Lynn” and what appears to be a segment of a walking/biking trail that goes along the waterfront. This area would be restricted from public access due to its proximity to the project site. The project would result in the following benefits to EJ populations as well as the wider public: • MWRA's Section 56 water pipeline supplies water and provides water system redundancy to portions of Lynn, Lynnfield, Marblehead, Nahant, Peabody, Revere, Saugus, and Swampscott. The EJ populations served by this pipeline as well as the wider community will benefit from the security that this pipeline replacement will bring to the area’s water supply. B. If an EJ population has been identified using the EJ Maps Viewer within 5 miles of the project site, will the project: (i) meet or exceed MEPA review thresholds under 301 CMR 11.03(8)(a)- (b) __ Yes _X_ No; or (ii) generate150 or more new average daily trips (ADT) of diesel vehicle traffic, excluding public transit trips, over a duration of 1 year or more. ___ Yes No C.

        "ATTACHMENT A Detailed Project Description",
        "1. Introduction The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) is proposing to replace a section of its existing Section 56 water pipeline, which helps supply water to portions of Lynn, Lynnfield, Marblehead, Nahant, Peabody, Revere, Saugus and Swampscott. This critical pipeline had previously provided redundancy for the MWRA Northern High Service Zone prior to 2018, when a section crossing the Saugus River via the General Edwards Bridge was removed due to severe corrosion and upcoming bridge work. The Section 56 water main has since been inoperable, leaving the Northern High Service Zone without redundancy and thus vulnerable to failure. MWRA's Section 56 Pipeline Replacement Project will ensure water system redundancy and reliability for residents and businesses in these communities, which is crucial to protecting public and environmental health. MWRA’s Section 56 pipeline was initially constructed in 1934 and is located below Ocean Avenue, Revere Street, Revere Beach Boulevard, the State Route 1A North ramp, and North Shore Road (State Route 1A) in Revere. The pipeline continues in Lynn along the Lynnway (State Route 1A) and Broad Street, terminating at the intersection of Broad and Washington Streets. Section 56 primarily consists of 20-inch diameter cast iron pipes for most of its length. During the design phase of the project, four pipe installation methods and eight routes were considered. Two routes were selected for further geotechnical investigation and supplemental borings. As discussed further in Section 3.2, after a review of the alternatives analysis and in consultation with the Cities of Revere and Lynn, Route 7 and Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) were selected as the preferred alternatives and are presented in this EENF. 2. Project Description The following section provides a description of the project site, project goal, and major work activities that would be required to implement the preferred alternative. 2.1. Project Site Description and Background The project area includes sites on either side of the Saugus River in Lynn and Revere. The project boundaries in Revere are from the intersection of Route 1A North Shore Road “Lynnway” and Rice Avenue in Revere, along Rice Avenue and into the Point of Pines Yacht Club parking. The proposed pipeline route continues below the Lower Saugus River northeasterly towards Hanson Street in Lynn, then westerly along Hanson Street to the intersection of Route 1A Northern Shore Road “Lynnway” Hanson Street, in Lynn. The project's southerly and northerly terminus points connect to the existing Section 56 Saugus River Crossing water main on North Shore Road in Revere and the Lynnway in Lynn. The proposed pipeline route can be seen in Figure 1. Site photos can be found in Attachment C. 1",
        "Figure 1. The proposed pipeline route, including two terrestrial portions (Lynn and Revere), and the section beneath the Saugus River. The terrestrial portions of the proposed water main will join with the existing Section 56 pipeline at the ends of Hanson Street and Rice Avenue. 2",
        "2.2. Project Goal The objective of the Project is a return to service of the Section 56 water main. Without the system redundancy previously provided by this water main, the MWRA Northern High Service Zone is vulnerable to failure. This project will reinstate system redundancy for the residents and businesses supported by this water pipeline. 2.3. Proposed Design MWRA is proposing that the portion of the Section 56 water main be replaced below the riverbed of the Saugus River between Lynn and Revere. The new water main section below the Saugus River would be installed via Horizontal Direction Drilling (HDD), with an entry pit located in Lynn near the southern end of Hanson Street and an exit pit in Revere within the Point of Pines Yacht Club parking lot. Table 1 and Figure 1 depict the limits various limits of work. Table 1. Limits of Work Area City Limit of Work Purpose (sqft) Installation of terrestrial pipeline via Rice Avenue pipeline installation 4,315 traditional cut-and-cover methods with existing paved roadway. Revere Equipment staging area for horizontal HDD Exit Staging Area (Point of Pines 13,740 directional drilling pipe string exit point. Yacht Club Parking Lot) Location is a paved parking lot. Installation of terrestrial pipeline via Hanson Street pipeline installation 10,040 traditional cut-and-cover methods with existing paved roadway. Equipment staging area for horizontal directional drilling pipe string entry point. HDD Entry Staging Area 37,050 Location is vegetated and parallels Hanson Street Extension. Access route for equipment required to Lynn remove the dilapidated timber piles along the Timber Pile Removal along Lynn Shoreline 25,590 Lynn shoreline. Route is vegetated and will need to be cleared (with stumps left in place) and will be replanted following construction. Area immediately north of the horizontal directional drilling for laying out the pipe Pipe string Layout Area 56,000 string prior to deployment. This area is necessary to ensure the pipe will enter the drill hole at the correct angle. The design elements of the proposed water main installation are illustrated in the various project plans and drawings in Attachment D. The new water main marine section would be connected to the existing pipeline on North Shore Road in Revere and the Lynnway in Lynn by water main segments installed via traditional open-cut excavation. 2.3.1 Terrestrial Pipeline Segments The on-land sections of the proposed Section 56 replacement pipeline will be installed by open- cut construction, which is the most common installation method for water mains. The trench will be opened approximately seven feet wide and will largely be within the existing paved roadways. Once the trench has been excavated to the required depth, pipe bedding material is placed in the bottom of the trench prior to installation of the pipe. The pipe will be installed section by section, and then backfilled and compaction will occur. The trench length open at any 3",
        "time will be approximately twenty to thirty feet in length (i.e., not in exceedance of the length of pipe that can reasonably be installed in one day). This length is slowly and constantly moving as construction is progressed. Trenches will be properly shored or sheeted to protect against trench collapses in accordance with all Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) trenching guidelines and requirements. In the event groundwater is encountered during the installation of the terrestrial pipeline segments, pumps and/or dewatering sumps will be used to keep the trench bottom in-the-dry during pipeline installation. Dewatering effluent will either be discharged to an upland area or an existing storm drain; in both cases, the dewatering effluent will be pumped through a silt sack/catch basin insert to reduce turbidity prior to discharge. All mains will be installed with 5 feet of cover where possible. The project will comply with applicable regulations and requirements per the NPDES Construction General Permits and NPDES Dewatering and Remediation General Permits. 2.3.2 Saugus River Crossing The Hanson Street (Lynn) and Rice Avenue (Revere) on-shore alignments will be connected via a section of pipe in the ground beneath the water of the Saugus River. It is proposed that this 34-inch diameter pipe be high-density polyethylene and installed via HDD. HDD is a method of underground utility installation that entails drilling a pilot hole at a relatively shallow angle. HDD is typically employed to avoid obstacles and minimize surface impacts. The length of the pipe beneath the Saugus River will be 2,800 feet. 2.3.3 Appurtenances The proposed 20-inch ductile iron Section 56 replacement pipeline will include pipe bends, line valves, required thrust restraints, blow-offs, and air release and vacuum valves. Horizontal bends will be installed at locations where a change of direction is required that exceeds the allowable joint deflection. Vertical bends will be installed where required to deflect the pipe above or below existing utilities, such as the 18-inch drainpipe in Rice Avenue at the Lynnway and the 36-inch culvert on Rice Avenue. No existing utilities will need to be relocated. The only above-ground impacts resulting from the installation of this water main will be six manholes. 2.3.4 Dredging Dredging will result as the water main to be installed in the ground beneath the water of the Saugus River will displace a volume of sediment (approximately 94,000 cubic yards). Additionally, twelve timber piles will need to be removed from the dilapidated seawall on the Lynn shoreline as they obstruct the proposed HDD path. Because the degraded wood piles are embedded in the ground, removal thereof is considered dredging (approximately 50 cubic yards). At this point in the design, there are two scenarios for pile removal under consideration. The first would be pile removal by land, and the second would entail the use of a barge to remove the piles. The former requires a greater land disturbance (primarily the clearing of vegetation). While the second scenario offers less impact on existing environmental conditions on land, the barge will need to be supported by spuds and temporarily grounded to the ocean floor. Environmental impacts of both scenarios (i.e., greater area of clearing on land and temporary impacts to Land Under Water) are discussed herein. See Project Plans in Attachment D and Section 5.2 for further details as to the area impacted by the proposed timber pile removals. 4",
        "3. Alternatives to the Project This section summarizes the alternatives to the proposed replacement project. As noted above, the project’s purpose is to return to service the Section 56 Water Main. To meet this purpose, various pipe materials and routes were evaluated. The No Action Alternative is also discussed below. After the alternatives below were fully considered, the proposed route and HDD installation method were selected as the preferred alternative for the reasons outlined below. 3.1. No Action The no-action alternative would result in the Section 56 pipeline remaining out of service. As indicated above, this pipeline provides a necessary redundancy in the water supply system, and without it, the MWRA Northern High Service Zone is vulnerable to failure. As a result, the no- action alternative was dismissed. 3.2. Route and Installation Method Alternatives In 2017, MWRA’s consultant conducted an alternatives analysis that analyzed four pipe installation methods and nine routes for the new pipe placement. The installation methods included open trench river crossing, Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD), microtunneling, and removal and replacement on the General Edwards bridge. The microtunneling alternative was rated favorably from a performance and risk perspective but had the highest cost and longer schedule duration. The open trench river crossing alternative was comparable in cost to HDD options but included greater environmental risk, greater permitting difficulty, and longer schedule duration. The pipe replacement on the bridge alternative scored less favorably due to reduced protection against damage, hydraulic limitations, greater technical complexity, and greater construction risk. Additionally, the General Edwards Bridge is deemed structurally deficient by MassDOT, and the Department is in the planning phase of replacing this 87-year- old structure. The bid date for this project is in 2028, which puts the timeline for finishing the bridge at least five years after that (with the possibility of it being much longer). Planning to put the pipeline on the bridge would cause a significant and unacceptable delay to the pipeline replacement, which again, is necessary to ensure water supply system redundancy for several communities. The 2017 Feasibility Study can be found in Attachment M. Route alternatives were screened concerning pipeline performance, program risks, cost, and schedule. Of the nine routes initially considered, two (Routes 3 and 7) were selected to be further evaluated, which included an extensive geotechnical investigation of these two potential alignments. This work included twelve geotechnical borings, nine marine geotechnical borings, and three test pits. These geotechnical survey methods provide a better understanding of which route is less impactful to the surrounding environments. The two pipe replacement alternatives, extending from Hanson Street in the City of Lynn to Rice Avenue in the City of Revere, were designated Route 3 and Route 7. Both routes connect to the Section 56 water main in the Revere on the North Shore Road/Lynnway near the ramp onto State Route 1A North and in the Lynn on the Lynnway (State Route 1A) opposite Hanson Street. In 2020, AECOM conducted geological boring investigations along Routes 3 and 7. Although both offered feasible routes from an HDD perspective, Route 7 involves a shorter distance of open-cut trench excavation for the land portion of the connection to the existing Section 56 water pipeline in Revere and therefore is the route with less impact on the Barrier Beach System, as well as less impact on the Point of Pines community. The weighted Route Selection Matrix summarizing the scoring of Routes 3 and 7 is provided in Attachment M. Following the 5",
        "geotechnical investigation, Route 7 was identified as the preferred pipeline route due to the less disruptive impacts on the Barrier Beach System and residents in the Point of Pines neighborhood. Because both pipeline routes were under consideration at the time the geotechnical investigation was performed, Route 3 is still visible on some figures. Route 7 is the proposed Project presented in this EENF; mention of or reference to Route 3 in any supplementary documents should be disregarded with concern to the proposed project. 4. Existing Environment 4.1. Topography, Soils, and Sediment According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service soil maps, the vicinity of Hanson Street, the timber pile removal site, the HDD Entry and Staging area, and the pipe string layout area (all of which are in Lynn, Essex County) are characterized as urban land (1.5 acres) and refuse substratum Udorthents (1.9 acres). Rice Avenue and the HDD Exit Staging area are characterized as sand beach (0.1 acres), Merrimac-Urban land complex 0 to 8 percent slopes (0.4 acres), and wet substratum Udorthents (<0.1 acres). Based on the Surficial Materials Map of the Lynn Quadrangle, Massachusetts, published by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 2018, surficial geology at the project site consists of artificial fill in Lynn and portions of the Revere side of the project site. This fill consists of earth and manmade materials that have been artificially placed. In addition, beach and dune deposits are present in the Point of Pines area in Revere. These deposits are primarily composed of sand and fine gravel deposited along the shoreline by waves, currents, and wind action. Beach sand deposits are composed of moderately sorted, very coarse to fine sand, and are commonly laminated. Coarser layers may contain fine gravel particles, while finer layers may contain very fine sand and silt. 4.1.1 Site Surveys An aerial survey was performed using aerial photography by Blue-Sky Geospatial Ltd., formerly Col-East. Bluesky utilized standard aerial photography methods to prepare topographic mapping at a scale of 1-inch equals 20 feet with 1-foot contour intervals. Single beam bathymetric, sub-bottom sonar and side scan sonar surveys were performed December 14-16, 2020. The surveys were intended to map current bathymetry (bed elevations), characterize sediment stratigraphy (overburden thickness), and identify surficial bed features which might hinder other aspects of site investigations. The extent of these operations was limited to the two alternate HDD alignments (Route 3 and Route 7) under consideration at the time. Figure 2 is a bathymetric map depicting site conditions using 1.0-foot NAD83 contours. A geophysical investigation along the land portions of the HDD alignments was conducted between late December 2020 and January 2021 by Hager GeoScience, Inc. (HGI). The purpose of this investigation was to locate potential obstructions, defined by AECOM as dense sands, fine or coarse gravels, cobbles, and boulders, to a depth of 50 feet. Because of the brackish tidal environment of the survey locations, HGI selected low-frequency ground penetrating radar (LFGPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) as the methods most likely to be able to resolve obstructions and map soil strata to the depth specified, with work to be performed during the low tide window to maximize depth penetration. The survey produced GPR and ERT figures that illustrate concentrations of gravel and individual cobbles and/or boulders observed along the proposed routes. On the Lynn side, the 6",
        "GPR data illustrates a two-tier stratigraphy below the reported clay layer starting at approximately 50 feet deep (Elevation ~40 feet). A few large objects are noted in the till. A U- shaped depression was noted as a former channel. This interval may represent a drainage system along which till was washed and fines were removed, leaving behind a concentration of coarse material. On the Revere side, GPR data show scattered individual objects within the clay layer and the beginning of concentrations of coarse material in the northern end of the profile, suggesting continuation into the channel. A portion of the route GPR traverse was obstructed by wooden docks owned by the Yacht Club, resulting in a 65-foot gap in coverage. 7",

        "4.1.2 Geophysical Borings To better inform the project design with information relative to soil properties and groundwater levels, an extensive environmental soil exploration was undertaken between October 2020 and January 2021. This program included twelve landside test borings with eight monitoring well installations. All test borings and monitoring well installations were conducted in the Cities of Lynn, MA (20B-9, and 20B-10MW through 20B-13MW) and Revere, MA (20B-1, 20B-5, 20B- 14MW through 20B-17MW, and 20B-18) as noted on Figure 3Error! Reference source not found.. In general, the land side of the project site is underlain by very loose to medium-dense sand fill, which can extend to depths up to 18 feet. The existing fill is underlain by either a natural sand or a slightly organic silt, which overlies stiff to soft clay. The clay layer can extend to a depth of up to 94 feet below the existing ground surface and is underlain by glacial till. The subsurface conditions in the Saugus River generally consist of 3 to 20 feet of silty sand with few organics, overlying a stiff to very soft clay or clayey sand deposit that can extend to 69 feet below the mudline, with boulders encountered near the center of the Saugus River and the Lynn coast. The clay and/or clayey sand deposit is generally underlain by silty sand and gravel overlying glacial till and Argillite bedrock. 9",

        "Since the project site spans a large geographical area, the subsurface conditions for the two land side areas in Lynn and Revere and the HDD route across the Saugus River are summarized separately in the sections presented below. 4.1.2.1 Hanson Street, Lynn Borings performed along Hanson Street in Lynn are identified as 20B-9, 20B-10MW, 20B- 11MW, 20B- 12MW, and 20B-13MW. The following strata were encountered: • Fill - Loose to occasionally medium-dense granular fill was encountered at the ground surface of each boring, which extended to depths between 8 and 13 feet (EL. 8.3 and EL. 3.2). • Organic Silt - The fill was underlain by a very soft to stiff, slightly organic silt deposit, which extended to depths between 11 and 16 feet (EL. 8.6 and EL. 0.7). • Glaciofluvial Granular Deposit – The organic silt deposit was underlain by a medium-dense glaciofluvial granular deposit, which ranged from 9 to at least 17 feet in thickness and extended to depths between 20 and 26 feet (EL.-3.7 and EL. -8.3). • Silt - A 4-foot-thick layer of stiff silt was observed to underlie the glaciofluvial deposit in boring 20B-9, extending to a depth of 29 feet (EL. -12.3). • Marine Clay - The silt deposit encountered in boring 20B-9 and the glaciofluvial deposit in the other borings were underlain by a very soft to stiff marine clay deposit. The medium stiff and stiff clay was generally observed directly beneath the glaciofluvial or silt deposits, transitioning to a softer clay with depth. In boring 20B-9, the marine clay deposit was observed to extend to a depth of 55 feet, corresponding to EL. -39. • Glacial Till - Dense to very dense glacial till was encountered beneath the marine clay. No bedrock was encountered within this set of borings. • The groundwater depth in the borings at the time of drilling ranged between 5.0 and 9.0 feet below the ground surface. Based on several readings taken at the monitoring wells after borehole completion, the depth to groundwater has been observed to vary between 5.0 and 7.0 feet from the ground surface and is tidally influenced. 4.1.2.2 Rice Avenue, Revere Borings performed along Rice Avenue, in order from east to west, in Revere are identified as 20B-1, 20B- 14MW, 20B-15MW, 20B-18, 20B-5, 20B-16MW, and 20B-17MW: • Fill - Medium dense granular fill was encountered at the ground surface of each boring, which extended to depths between 8 and at least 17.5 feet (EL. 8.9 and EL. -1.4). • Glaciofluvial Deposit - The fill was underlain by a loose to medium-dense glaciofluvial deposit consisting mainly of sand, which ranged from 11.5 to at least 17 feet in thickness and extended to depths between 24 and at least 29 feet (EL. -8.8 and EL. -12.9). • Marine Clay - The glaciofluvial deposit was underlain by very soft to very stiff marine clay. The stiff clay was generally observed directly beneath the glaciofluvial deposit, transitioning to a softer clay with depth. • Glacial Till - The marine clay deposit extended to depths between 94 and 98.5 feet (EL. - 80.6 and EL. -82.4). Dense glacial till was encountered below the marine clay deposit. No bedrock was encountered within this set of borings. • The groundwater depth in the borings at the time of drilling ranged between 4.0 and 9.0 feet below the ground surface. Based on several readings taken at the monitoring wells after 11",
        "borehole completion, the depth to groundwater has been observed to vary between 4.0 and 9.0 feet from the ground surface and is tidally influenced. 4.1.2.3 Saugus River HDD Route (Route 7) Borings performed along Saugus River Route 7 are identified as 20B-5, 20B-6, 20B-7, 20B-8, 20B-19, 20B- 21, 20B-21A, and 20B-9: • River Sediment - Soft river sediment was encountered at the mudline of every boring. The sediment was comprised of sand and silt and extended to depths between 5 and 7 feet (EL. -5.2 and EL. -16.6). Glaciofluvial Deposit - The river sediment was underlain by a medium-dense glaciofluvial deposit of interbedded sand and clay, which extended to a depth of 7 feet below the mudline (EL. -7.0). • Marine Clay Deposit- The glaciofluvial deposit was underlain by a very soft to stiff marine clay deposit, with the stiff clay located near the top of the deposit transitioning to a softer clay with depth. This deposit extended to depths between 20 and 30 feet below the mudline (EL. -18.8 and EL. -40.0). • Gravel Deposit - The marine clay deposit was underlain by an 11.5-foot-thick deposit of very dense gravel encountered in boring 20B-21 at a depth of 23.5 feet, corresponding to EL. - 21.7. • Glaciofluvial Deposit - The gravel was underlain by a very loose to medium-dense glaciofluvial deposit, mainly consisting of sand, gravel, and clay. This deposit extended to depths between 45 and 70 feet below the mudline (EL. -45.0 and EL. -81.6). • Glacial Till - The glaciofluvial deposit was underlain by medium-dense to very dense glacial till, which extended to depths between 75 and 95 feet (EL. -74.0 and EL. -95.0). • Argillite Bedrock - Fresh, very hard Argillite (bedrock) underlaid the glacial till. The top of bedrock was encountered between elevations EL. -74.0 and EL. -95.0. 4.1.3 Sediment Quality An environmental soil sampling program was conducted in conjunction with the geotechnical exploration with the purpose of obtaining representative characterization data to assist with soil and groundwater management planning and obtaining necessary permits and approvals for off- site soil disposal facilities and regulatory agencies overseeing groundwater treatment and/or discharge. No soil above the Massachusetts Contingency Plan reportable conditions were found. The results of the soil sampling and analyses can be found in Attachment F and are discussed generally herein. All landside test borings and groundwater monitoring wells were completed with truck-mounted drill rigs operated by GeoLogic-Earth Exploration, Inc. of Norfolk, MA. The test borings were advanced using flush-jointed casing with drive and wash drilling techniques using a 4-inch drag bit. Drilling operations were conducted in conformance with ASTM standards where prudent. A driven standard split spoon (SPT) sampler was advanced to recover samples of soils. Continuous samples were collected using 2-foot split spoon samplers. The result of the soil sampling and analyses (26 samples, 2 per soil boring plus two duplicates) as pertaining to environmental standards are summarized below: • In general, PID screening results of soil sample headspaces were non-detectable or within background levels (below two parts per million per volume [ppmv]). There were low readings of 16 ppmv at 20B-10, and 4.4 ppmv and 2.1 ppm at 20B-18. 12",
        "• Very low or non-detectable levels of extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were detected in various samples, with all levels well below RCS-1 standards. No volatile petroleum hydrocarbon (VPH) levels were detected in the samples. • Various levels of total metals were detected in the samples, with all levels except one, below RCS-1 standards. Lead was detected in the 20B-14MW duplicate sample (3 – 5 ft bgs) at 350 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and at 170 mg/kg in the other sample from the same interval. The arithmetic average of the two samples is 260 mg/kg, which is above the RCS-1 lead standard of 200 mg/kg. This sample location, along Rice Avenue in Revere, is within an RCS-1 area because of residential homes within 500 ft (310 CMR 40.0361). The PLM analyses of the sample from 20B-14MW (3 – 5 ft bgs) indicated the following material detected: Coal (moderate), Coal Ash (moderate), Wood Ash (light), and Asphalt (trace). Per MassDEP, a background concentration for lead in soil containing coal ash or wood ash associated with fill material is 600 mg/kg (Table 1 of MassDEP’s Background Levels of PAHs and Metals in Soil Technical Update May 2002), and lead levels below this can be attributable to fill containing coal ash or wood ash and is exempt from reporting to MassDEP. • TCLP–lead analyses were completed on three samples, and the results are 0.83 milligrams per liter (mg/l) (20B-14MW, 3 – 5 ft bgs) to 1.8 mg/l (20B-15MW, 3 – 5 ft bgs), indicating non-hazardous. • No levels of PCBs, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and reactive cyanide and sulfide were detected in the 26 samples. • Very low or non-detectable levels of semi-VOCs or polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) contained with the EPH analyses were detected in various samples. Except for one compound, all levels are below RCS-1 standards. The PAH acenaphthene was detected at a level of 5.3 in the 10 – 12 ft bgs sample from 20B- 12MW (Lynn), which is slightly greater than the RCS-1 standard of 4 mg/kg, but below the RCS-2 standard of 3,00 mg/kg. The sample location is in a RCS-2 area based upon the S-2 definition in the MCP (310 CMR 40.0361), and therefore does not constitute a reportable condition. • Although there were no reportable conditions above the Massachusetts Contingency Plan, a small portion of the project area is currently regulated under the MCP. The site in question is a closed National Grid MCP disposal site on Riley Way Extension (Release Tracking Number [RTN] 3-0032437). The Conceptual Site Model for the closed National Grid site states the following about soil impacts: “The results of the investigation activities indicate that PAHs and metals are present in soil, and are likely related to a combination of fill material (including remnants of the timber bulkhead and asphalt pavement for Riley Way Extension), the former landfill, and the history of industrial activities in the immediate vicinity of the site; there are other no apparent sources for these compounds.” As of 2014, the status of the site is “Permanent Solution with No Conditions.” The only work proposed in that area of the site would be the pipe string laydown area, which would not entail ground disturbance. 13",
        "4.2. Wetland Resource Areas An off-site wetlands investigation included the consultation of various sources regarding the topography, wetlands, and floodplains in and around the proposed project area. Off-site resources consulted included the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic map, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Hazard Layer, the MassDEP wetlands and hydrologic connection MassGIS data overlay, National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) MassGIS overlay, and the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) Program MassGIS layer. An AECOM wetland scientist (PWS) conducted onsite resource area delineations to identify regulated resource areas present, and the top of Coastal Beach in both Revere and Lynn in particular. These delineations were performed on May 14, 2020 and were in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (Technical Report Y-87-1; ACOE 1987) and Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Northcentral and Northeast Region (USACE 2012), the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (WPA) regulations (310 CMR 10.00), and MassDEP’s publication entitled “Applying the Massachusetts Coastal Wetlands Regulations” published August 2017. Per this manual, a subsequent desktop delineation was performed to identify the top of Coastal Bank in Lynn. Wetland resource areas protected under the Massachusetts Wetland Protection Act (MA WPA) and implementing regulations (301 CMR 10.00) that are present at the site include Coastal Beach, Coastal Dune/Barrier Beach Complex, Coastal Bank, 200-foot Riverfront Area, and Bordering Land Subject to Flooding (which coincides with the FEMA designated 100-year Floodplain). In addition, the 100-foot Buffer Zone to various resource areas is present. The boundary of these resource areas is illustrated in Figures 2A and 2B in Attachment B. The location of Coastal Bank in Lynn was determined using 1-foot site contours and according to the Coastal Manual. A field visit on March 10th, 2023, confirmed actual field conditions. For the purposes of the coastal bank delineation, the scope of analysis was within 100 feet of the project area. The CZM Coastal Manual indicates that the “coastal bank begins at the toe of the coastal bank slope, whether other coastal wetland resources end….The landward edge (or top) of the coastal bank is generally the top of, or the first major break in, the face of the coastal bank”. The lower boundary of Coastal Bank was defined as the upper boundary of Coastal Beach, as flagged in the field. Top of Coastal Bank is determined by the following scenario (Scenario D) from the Coastal Manual: “A ‘top of coastal bank’ will fall below the 100-year flood elevation and is the point where the slope ceases to be ≥10:1.”. This DEP Bank Policy figure illustrating Scenario D is shown in Figure 4 and was selected as the most applicable scenario to the site conditions because Coastal Bank confines Land Under the Ocean at the site, but Land Subject to Coastal Zone Flowage extends well inland and is not confined by Coastal Bank. 14",
        "Figure 4. Scenario D from the Coastal Manual. No Bordering Vegetated Wetland (BVW) is present within the limits of work (as indicated by the MassDEP Wetland data layer and confirmed during on-site wetland delineation). Bordering Land Subject to Flooding (BLSF) is present at nearly the entire project site. BLSF boundaries are illustrated in Figure 2A in Attachment B. No aquatic vegetation was seen around the base of the timber piles during a site visit in March 2023. 4.3. Fisheries and Wildlife No fisheries data are available for the Saugus River, and no evidence suggests any commercial fisheries are located near the project site. However, the Saugus River is mapped by the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries as a diadromous fish migratory habitat for the following species: alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), white perch (Morone americana), and Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod). Anecdotal evidence suggests that striped bass (Morone saxatilis), winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) may be present in the area (Fishbrain.com, April 2023). The Saugus River is mapped as a diadromous fish migratory habitat by the National Marine Fisheries Services for the species listed in Section 4.3. (above). Additionally, NOAA Fisheries maps this area as Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for species including Atlantic surfclam (Spisula solidissima), Bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), Silver Hake (Merluccius bilinearis), Little Skate (Leucoraja erinacea), Atlantic Mackerel (Scomber scombrus), Yellowtail flounder (Pleuronectes ferruginea), among others. The area is also mapped as Highly Migratory Species EFH for Bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias). 15",
        "Recreational fishing occurs adjacent to the project site on both sides of the river. The Revere side of the river crossing is used as a yacht club and boat dock. A fishing pier is located at the mouth of the Saugus River in Lynn. The pier was closed from public access in the past several years for repairs, and it remains unclear whether it is open to the public at this time. Wildlife that may be present in the area includes ubiquitous species present in the North Coast watershed, including the gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and New England cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus transitionalis). The area provides appropriate habitat for many types of common bird species as well. 4.4. Threatened and Endangered Species Based on a review of the most recent Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) mapping, the project area overlaps with Priority Habitat of the Piping Plover, (Charadrius melodus) on the beach in Revere. Based on information available on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) website, there are no land-based endangered species or critical habitats known to occur in the project area. A threatened species, the Northern Long-eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis), has the potential to occur throughout Massachusetts, including the project area. However, there are no known maternity roost trees in the region, and the nearest known winter hibernacula is more than 8 miles from the project site. Thus, neither preparation of a Biological Assessment nor further consultation with USFWS under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is required. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) website was reviewed for Section 7 threatened and endangered species. It was determined that there were no critical habitats in the project area for the species listed. The species listed on the NMFS website are: large whales, sea turtles, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Gulf of Maine, Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus), and shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum). 4.5. Historic Structures or Districts and Archaeological Sites A terrestrial and underwater assessment of the entire study area's archaeological sensitivity was conducted before the geotechnical investigation in 2021. This included the review of historical boring logs and bathymetric data collected for the project. Archaeological monitoring and recordation of the geotechnical borings and test pits provided information regarding subsurface conditions and preservation potential for archaeological resources. No archaeological resources have been previously identified within the project area. Consultations with the Massachusetts Board of Underwater Archaeological Resources (BUAR) and the Massachusetts Historical Commission (MHC) occurred prior to the field program. Following the field program, the report was sent to BUAR, who then provided confirmation of their concurrence with the reported results and conclusions. Documentation of this consultation can be found in Attachment E. Certain terrestrial borings indicated the potential for archaeological resources. Archaeological monitoring of trench excavation will be performed, for which an amended State Archaeologist Permit will be obtained in coordination with MHC. If archaeological resources are observed, work will halt and appropriate protocols will be followed. 16",
        "As for the marine potential for archaeological resources, background research did not identify any historical properties in or directly adjacent to the HDD corridors. In addition, both geophysical surveys did not record potential previously sub-aerially exposed landforms. Geotechnical borings did record the presence of peat fragments in two cores but it was determined that they were not in situ and likely originated from eroded peat beds outside of the project area. Engineering studies of the sediments in the HDD indicate a very low potential for frac-outs occurring during the water main installation that would migrate up the organic-rich strata or to the surface. Based on these results, no further marine archaeological investigations are recommended or required by BUAR (see communication in Attachment E). 4.6. Hydrology and Water Quality The Saugus River begins at Lake Quannapowitt in Wakefield and meanders south thirteen miles through eleven communities before emptying into the Broad Sound. Near its mouth, the river becomes the Rumney Marsh/Pine River Estuary. Tributaries include the Mill River in Wakefield, Shute Brook in Saugus, Strawberry Brook in Lynn, Town Line Brook in Revere, Malden, and Everett. The river drains a watershed of approximately forty-seven square miles, which includes several ponds, such as Breeds Pond (Lynn), Birch Pond (Lynn), Walden Pond (Lynn), Hawkes Pond (Lynn), Crystal Lake (Wakefield), and Spring Pond (Saugus). During the environmental groundwater sampling program, characteristic data was obtained to assist with groundwater management planning, obtaining necessary approvals or permits from regulatory agencies overseeing groundwater treatment/discharge, and completing any required plans for groundwater management. Groundwater sample analyses included the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Remediation General Permit (RGP) parameters list. During this investigation, dissolved lead was detected in a groundwater sample (20B-14MW) along a short stretch of Rice Avenue in Revere. The level detected is above Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) reportable concentration and constituted a 120-day reportable condition per the MCP (MWRA notified the property owner of the condition). The other results of groundwater sampling and analyses (9 samples in November 2020 and 3 samples in 2021) are summarized below. • Very low or non-detectable levels of EPH, VPH, VOCs and SVOCs, Oil and Grease (TPH) were detected in the samples, all below RCGW-2 standards. • There were non-detectable levels of PCBs in the samples. • In the 2020 samples, very low or non-detectable levels of total metals were detected in various samples, and except for two samples, all levels are below RCGW-2 standards. The total lead level of 17 micrograms per liter (ug/l) in the sample from 20B-14MW is slightly above the RCGW-2 standard of 10 ug/l. The total selenium level of 170 ug/l in the sample from 20B-15MW is above the RCGW-2 standard of 100 ug/l. The re-sampling in April 2021 indicated dissolved lead at 11 ug/l in the sample from 20B-14MW and dissolved selenium at 7.6 ug/l in the sample from 20B-15MW (below the RCGW-2 standard, which applies to dissolved levels, not total). The July 2021 dissolved lead result from the sample from 20B- 14MW was 110 ug/l. The lead condition constitutes a 120-day reportable condition per the MCP. AECOM notified MWRA via e-mail on April 14, 2021 of the April 2021 dissolved lead in groundwater reportable condition, and MWRA notified the property owners (Point of Pines Beach Association, Inc.) in a letter dated August 12, 2021. 17",
        "At the location of the proposed pipeline installation, the Saugus River has a Zone AE floodplain, as depicted in Figure 5 (and Figure 2A in Attachment B). The Base Flood Water Surface elevation (BFE) in Lynn is shown to be EL 14 feet NAVD88. In Revere, this elevation is EL 10 feet NAVD88. Figure 5. Excerpt from Flood Insurance Rate Map for Essex County (Lynn, Panel 529) and Suffolk County (Revere, Panel 29). The maps are not to scale with respect to one another. 18",
        "4.7. Air Quality The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has set a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone, as well as other pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulate matter, and lead. The USEPA establishes primary and secondary standards. While primary standards focus on public health, secondary standards concern general public welfare, such as visibility. The state regulates air quality using USEPA’s standards (310 CMR 6.00). MassDEP maintains monitoring stations throughout the state that record the highest concentration of the mean concentration of regulated air pollutants. There are two MassDEP air monitoring stations within five miles of the project site: 390 Parkland Avenue in Lynn and 31 Willow Street in Chelsea. The Lynn station monitors particulate matter (PM ) concentrations, ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and volatile organic 2.5 compounds, among other meteorological data. The Chelsea station monitors PM 2.5 concentrations. Data from these stations indicate that in 2021 there were no exceedances above the NAAQS at either station for any of the measured parameters during 2021 (MassDEP, 2022). MassDEP also regulates volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the state’s air pollution regulations also qualitatively regulate odor, by stating that no person having control of any odor- generating operations shall permit emissions therefrom which cause or contribute to a condition of air pollution (310 CMR 7.09). There were no obvious odors noted during any of the site visits. 4.8. Noise Many federal agencies use the day-night sound level to describe noise and to predict community effects from long-term exposure to noise. In addition, this noise level classification system is used to determine the appropriateness of a given use of specific land (land use compatibility) relative to the average level of environmental noise experienced at the location. Noise levels ranging from 65-75 decibels are generally compatible with residential land use. On the Revere side of the project site, the nearest residence is 10 Rice Avenue. The open-cut trench for the terrestrial pipeline will be dug approximately thirty feet away from this residence’s front door. The current noise-producing activities at the Revere site include those affiliated with recreational boating and the traffic on North Shore Road. In Lynn, the nearest residence is half a mile from the project site. The current noise-producing activities at the Lynn staging area include construction activities affiliated with the Lynn Landfill Cap Repair, an ongoing project adjacent to the proposed HDD Staging Area/Entry. 4.9. Traffic and Transportation The impacted roadways due to construction are shown in Table 2 with roadway classification and jurisdiction indicated. Route 1A: Route 1A is a multi-lane roadway that runs in the North/South direction connecting Boston in the South to Northeastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine in the North. The area of construction for this project occurs at the intersection of Route 1A and Hanson Street in Lynn, MA. This intersection is in a commercially developed area with several businesses in the immediate vicinity. Business hours are generally 7 AM to 9 PM for businesses within 1,000 feet of the area of construction. There is no parking allowed on Route 1A. The lane configuration for each approach is as follows: • Route 1A Northbound: Three through lanes. 19",
        "• Hanson Street Westbound: One left turn lane and one right turn lane. • Route 1A Southbound: Three through lanes and one southbound left turn lane. Hanson Street (Lynn): Hanson Street is approximately forty-five feet wide with one lane of traffic in each direction and two-hour parking allowed on both sides. Hanson street is a local street that provides access to two business developments from Route 1A. Hanson Street provides no connections to other roadways and is terminated on one end. At the road terminus there is a gate blocking vehicle access. There is a sidewalk on both sides of the road. Pedestrians may continue beyond the gate and access the Lynn Community Path. Rice Ave (Revere): Rice Ave ranges between approximately eighteen feet wide to twenty-two feet wide with one lane of traffic in each direction. No parking is permitted on Rice Ave. Rice Ave is a local street in a dense residential neighborhood. There is a non-continuous sidewalk on the north side of the street. Several side streets intersect with Rice Ave. These side streets are all one-way southbound roadways. The intersection of Rice Ave, Whitin Ave, and Lynnway: Lynnway is a one-way street that provides access to Rice Ave and Whitin Ave from Route 1A. Whitin Ave is a one-way street in the southbound direction. Rice Ave is a two-direction street. Vehicles entering the intersection from Rice Ave must make a left turn onto Whitin Ave. Table 2.

Aesthetic Resources/Open Space/Recreational Resources The area surrounding the proposed water pipeline installation in Revere is a residential neighborhood. The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation owns and maintains the Lynnway and North Shore Road and adjacent Right-of-Way, immediately west of the intersection between Rice Avenue and the Lynnway. This parcel of land is mapped as Article 97 Open Space on the MassGIS datalayer (MassMapper, 2023). Vegetation on the said parcel is limited to mixed herb-level grasses. See Attachment C for representative photographs of the project area). The area surrounding the proposed water pipeline installation in Lynn is primarily industrial and suspected to be entirely fill. The HDD staging area and pipe string layout are in an area restricted from public access due to an ongoing, adjacent landfill cap project. The capped landfill will be the site of a planned harbor park. As evidenced by footpaths in the vegetation and occasional trash in the vicinity of the timber pile removal site, the project site seemingly is used 20",
        "currently for passive recreation, such as walking and fishing. See Attachment C for representative photographs of the project area). 4.11. Socioeconomic Characteristics / Environmental Justice 4.11.1 Revere Socioeconomic Characteristics According to the 2017-2021 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (U.S. Census Bureau, Table DP05, ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates), the City of Revere has a population of 60,720. The racial composition of the population was 79.2 percent White, 7.0 percent Black or African American, 0.8 percent American Indian or Alaska Native, 5.7 percent Asian, 0.1 percent Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 21 percent some other race. In terms of ethnicity, 36.7 percent of the city was Hispanic or Latino. Also, according to the 2016-2020 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (Table DP05, Median Household Income in the Past 12 Months), the median household income in Revere was $64,331. The poverty rate in the city was 13 percent (Table S1701, Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months). 4.11.2 Lynn Socioeconomic Characteristics According to the 2017-2021 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (U.S. Census Bureau, Table DP05, ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates), the City of Lynn has a population of 100,233. The racial composition of the population was 58.4 percent White, 19.5 percent Black or African American, 2.0 percent American Indian or Alaska Native, 6.4 percent Asian, 0.7 percent Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and 26.4 percent some other race. In terms of ethnicity, 41.8 percent of the city was Hispanic or Latino. Also, according to the 2017-2021 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (Table DP05, Income in the Past 12 Months), the median household income in Lynn was $64,986. The poverty rate in the city was 13.6 percent (Table S1701, Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months). 4.11.3 Environmental Justice The project site is located within two block groups designated as environmental justice populations in Lynn and Revere. The Revere block group is designated an EJ community on the basis of minority and the Lynn block group on the basis of minority and income. There are 29 additional block groups designated as environmental justice populations either in whole or in part within the designated geographic area (i.e., within one mile of the project). Nine block groups are minority populations, six are minority and English isolation, three are minority and income, and eleven are minority, income, and English isolation. The EJ Screening Forms in Attachment I have maps of the populations in a one-mile radius color coded by EJ criteria. Table 3 provides a summary. The full list of Environmental Justice populations within five miles of the project site can be found in Attachment I. 21",

As shown in Table 4, Revere meets two of the criteria (Childhood Asthma ED Visits and Hearth Attack Rate), and Lynn meets two of the criteria (Childhood Asthma ED Visits and Elevated Blood Lead Presence). Saugus does not exhibit priority community environmental justice criteria, as the related health indicators are statistically significantly higher than statewide rates based on a five-year rolling average.

        "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s EJScreen Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool (Version 2.0) provides percentile rankings by census block group, compared against statewide averages, for 12 environmental indicators. The state percentile indicates what percent of the Massachusetts population has an equal or lower value, meaning less potential for exposure, risk, or proximity. The two block groups in which project activities are proposed to occur are Block Group 1, Census Tract 1705.02, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, (Revere) and Block Group 1, Census Tract 2072, Essex County, Massachusetts (Lynn). Table 6 summarizes the rankings for these two census tracts. The data suggests these two clock groups generally have higher rankings than the State Average in the indicators listed. Table 6 indicates higher potential for exposure, risk, and proximity to environmental hazards. Notably, both block groups are within the 99th state percentile for 2017 Air Toxics Cancer Risk, 96th percentile for 2017 Air Toxics Respiratory Hazard Index, and both are above the 90th percentile for RMP Facility Proximity.

Source: Based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EJScreen (Version 2.0), accessed May 3, 2023. Attachment G provides the output report generated from the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool. Based on user-provided project information and the project location, the RMAT Tool output indicates “High Exposure” preliminary climate change exposure and risk ratings for sea level rise/storm surge, extreme precipitation – urban flooding, and extreme heat. This comprises a preliminary assessment of whether the project site and the proposed project infrastructure (assets) are exposed to impacts of natural hazard events and/or future impacts of climate change. The RMAT Project Report also notes that the proposed project is within mapped environmental justice populations. While the analysis indicates “High Exposure” to risks 26",
        "related to climate change, when the replacement pipeline is finished, the pipeline will be underground and underwater. This inherent aspect of the project design mitigates risk to the infrastructure. The project will also ensure water system redundancy and increased resiliency to the impacts of climate change. 5. Impacts of Proposed Project 5.1. Topography, Soils, and Sediment In Lynn, a portion of the shoreline would be impacted during construction, which may cause the potential for short-term soil erosion and the need for minor regrading. Pre-construction activities to mitigate this potential would include the installation of erosion and sedimentation controls, as shown on Sheets C-1 and C-2 and the HDD-7 Entry Point Major Equipment Layout figure in Attachment D. The HDD Staging Area and Entry site would also need to be cleared and grubbed, which would result in surface-level soil disturbance. No soil erosion is anticipated in Revere, as both the HDD Staging and Exit site and the Hanson Street limit of work are within paved areas. The sediment dredged by the HDD drill bit to accommodate the pipeline is approximately 94,000 cubic yards. Dredged sediment will be separated onsite by a series of sieves and cyclones into soil and sand. These materials will then be trucked offsite for disposal. The material is expected to be suitable for use as daily cover at a nearby landfill and this will be confirmed by sampling once the material is stockpiled as it is generated. It is not expected that contamination will be detected due to the depths of the sediments and distance from surface impacts. In addition to the dredging related to the HDD installation, the removal of the twelve timber piles is also considered dredging. The volume of material being removed (i.e., the volume of the piles under the mudline) is 50 cubic yards. The dilapidated timber piles will be cut into pieces (to discourage their reuse) and disposed of off-site. Their deteriorated quality and the presence of creosote make the piles unsuitable for reuse on-site or otherwise. 5.2. Wetland Resource Areas The proposed project would result in temporary impacts to a variety of wetland resource areas present at the site that are protected under the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (MA WPA) and implementing regulations (310 CMR 10.00), including Coastal Dune/Barrier Beach System, Coastal Bank, Coastal Beach/Tidal Flats, 200-foot Riverfront Area, Bordering Land Subject to Flooding, and the 100-foot Buffer Zone. Table 7 summarizes the proposed impacts to these resource areas. Activities resulting in these impacts are further described below in sections organized according to which resource area is affected. As there will be impacts to resource areas on both sides of the Saugus River in two different municipalities (which will be mitigated to the extent practicable), the leftmost column in Table 7 indicates whether the resource area being impacted is in Lynn or Revere. The only permanent impacts associated with the project are the installation of six manholes (three in Lynn and three in Revere) and filling the voids left from the timber pile removal. These manholes will be installed within Rice Avenue, Hanson Street (both of which are areas that are already paved). 27",

They include the parking lot used as the HDD Staging/Exit Area and the Rice Avenue limit of work (LOW). No work will take place within the undeveloped, sandy beachfront. All work in the Barrier Beach System will be limited to paved areas (and the grassy shoulder at the western end of Rice Avenue). 5.2.2 200-foot Riverfront Area The Rice Avenue pipeline installation and the HDD Staging/Exit Area are located partially within the 200-foot Riverfront Area. As previously discussed, this terrestrial section of the pipeline will be installed via traditional cut-and-cover methods in a trench approximately seven feet wide within existing paved areas (the Point of Pines Yacht Club Parking Lot), roadway, and grassy shoulder at the western end of Rice Avenue. As the project limit of work (LOW) within the 200- oot Riverfront Area is entirely developed and paved, no clearing will be necessary. Sedimentation controls in the form of coir wattles will be installed along the perimeter of work, as shown in the attached project plans. 5.2.3 Coastal Bank A 950-square-foot section of Coastal Bank will need to be regraded in either timber pile removal scenario to facilitate equipment access to the pile removal site. The extent of the Bank that will need to be regraded has been reduced to the extent practicable and routed to avoid a large tree that appears to provide support to the bank. The regrading will include the temporary placement of geotextile reinforcement and riprap to make the slope less steep. Both the geotextile reinforcement and the riprap will be removed following construction, and the bank will be returned to preexisting conditions. These layers of protection will help prevent erosion to the bank structure and maintain its existing slope to the extent practicable. Vegetation on the coastal bank in the path that will need regrading will be cleared. Stumps of the trees and shrubs being removed will be ground to grade so that the support the roots provide to the Coastal Bank 28",
        "will remain intact. During construction, riprap would prevent sediment transport. This riprap will be removed following construction. In the long term, there will be no adverse effect on the movement of sediment from the bank. 5.2.4 Coastal Beach/Tidal Flats Work within Coastal Beach, including tidal flats, is limited to the extraction and subsequent fill of twelve timber piles from the dilapidated sea wall along the shoreline in Lynn. The area of Coastal Beach/Tidal Flat temporarily impacted by this work is 1,800 square feet. This pile removal will have no adverse effect by increasing erosion, decreasing the volume, or changing the form of the Coastal Beach or Tidal Flat. The existing dilapidated seawall provides no significant structure to the sediments or the form of the beach, and the partial removal thereof presents no adverse impact. The removal of the timber piles will not have any adverse effect on any specified habitat sites or rare vertebrate or invertebrate species. The pile removal itself will impact approximately 40 square feet and necessitate 50 cubic yards of low-density grout to be pumped into these voids. The timber piles will be excavated either by land or by barge. In either scenario, the voids left from the pile removal would be backfilled with grouting immediately following the removal. Grouting will be pumped through a tube into the hollow pipe from a pump truck. The pump truck would remain upslope of the Mean High Water line. The land removal scenario would require the piles to be removed on the upslope side of the existing Lynn timber bulkhead at low tide along the horizontal directional drilling route. The piles will be excavated at low tide and backfilled before the high tide returns during one tidal cycle. Geotextile will be placed where equipment will need to traverse the Coastal Beach to facilitate access and protect the bank from erosion. The removal by barge scenario would entail a spud barge with a large crane at a seaward position adjacent to the piles. The barge would be anchored in place by H-piles on each of the four corners, each with a surface area of 30 square inches for a total area of impact to Tidal Flats of less than one square foot. These spuds would be placed temporarily and are not anticipated to permanently alter Coastal Beach/Tidal Flats. If the work requires more than one tidal cycle, the barge will be removed from the shore to a depth that would prevent the barge from grounding. Upon the return of the high tide, the barge would be floated back in place to complete the pile extraction. 5.2.5 100-foot Buffer Zone Work within the 100-foot Buffer Zone of the Coastal Bank and Coastal Beach includes a portion of the HDD staging area (including the drill entry point), the access route to the timber bulkhead, a portion of the terrestrial pipeline installation within Hanson Street, and the pipe string laydown area. The HDD Staging Area and entry site will need to be cleared and grubbed to accommodate construction equipment. This area is vegetated primarily with phragmites and mixed grasses. Some sections include larger trees and shrubs such as Eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), white ash (Fraxinus americana), staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina), crab apple (Malus spp.), flowering pear (Pyrus calleryana), Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica), and multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora). The area will be revegetated with comparable, native plant species following all construction activities. The access route to the timber piles will also need to be cleared but not grubbed and is primarily vegetated by mixed grasses and autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata). This area will also be revegetated with comparable native plantings. As previously discussed, Hanson Street is paved, and the terrestrial pipeline installation will not 29",
        "require any clearing of vegetation. Similarly, the pipe string laydown area follows Riley Way Extension and will not require any vegetation to be cleared. 5.3. Fisheries and Wildlife As noted on the USACE New England website, Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF) recommends time of year (TOY) work restrictions in the Saugus River for the following species: alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), white perch (Morone americana), Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod), winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), and shellfish. The generic recommended DMF TOY restriction for these species is that no work occurs between February 15 and November 10. Construction period work restrictions specific to the Section 56 crossing will require consultation with the USACE and may allow work outside of the generic DMF TOY window considering that the proposed construction by HDD is not anticipated to directly impact the water column or substrate of the Saugus River. The construction noise may influence the local fish and wildlife populations in the general area. This temporary impact is necessary to install this pipeline and restore system redundancy to the communities impacted. Short-term disruption to the area during construction is not anticipated to negatively impact fish or wildlife long-term. 5.4. Threatened and Endangered Species As previously stated, the project area overlaps with Priority Habitat for the Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus). The project proposes temporary impacts to 4,000 square feet of NHESP Priority Habitat to store Point of Pines Yacht Club’s floating docks in the boating off-season. The Point of Pines Yacht Club has been storing many of these floats on the beach for several seasons under an Order of Conditions from the Revere Conservation Commission. The rest of the floats are typically stored in the parking lot, which will be unavailable due to construction activities. The total floats that need to be stored on the beach have a footprint of 4,000 square feet. The floating docks will be stored on the beach between October 1st to April 1st to avoid the sensitive range of dates for the plovers (April 1st through August 31st). They will be stacked to minimize their cumulative footprint. No work of excavation will occur in NHESP area as work will not occur on the beach and, in Revere, be limited to existing paved areas (and the grassy shoulder at the western end of Rice Avenue). While the endangered Northern Long-eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis) has the potential to occur throughout Massachusetts, there are no known maternity roost trees in the region, and the nearest known winter hibernacula are more than 8 miles from the project site. Thus, no impacts on threatened or endangered species are anticipated. 5.5. Historic Structures or Districts and Archaeological Sites The terrestrial potential for archaeological resources referenced in Section 4.5 was investigated during the geotechnical boring program with oversight from MHC and BUAR. The archaeological investigation indicated that natural stratigraphy is present under modern fill deposits within portions of the proposed water main trench along Rice Avenue in Revere. The Massachusetts Historical Commission has required that an archaeologist be present to monitor the construction of the water main installation within the Rice Avenue portion of the project. Documentation of this is provided in Attachment E. A qualified archaeologist shall be present during construction to confirm that no archaeological deposits/sites are encountered during construction activities. If a site or archaeological deposit is encountered, then the construction 30",
        "crew will be required to stop work while the archaeologist assesses the deposit based on MHC guidelines. The 2021 Archaeology Report for the project, which BUAR confirmed agreement with, concluded that there was low potential for archaeological resources present along the HDD subterranean route as well as a low potential for surface frac-outs. Based on these results, no further marine archaeological investigations are recommended or required by BUAR, and no adverse impacts to marine archaeological resources are anticipated. Please see the communication with MHC and BUAR in Attachment E for further elaboration. 5.6. Hydrology and Water Quality As the new pipeline section will be entirely underground, there will be no impact to the hydrology or the water quality of the Saugus River caused by the pipe installation by HDD methods. The potential for inadvertent returns during drilling (“frac-out”) has been considered in developing the pipe string route). Frac-outs occur when drilling fluid is released to the ground surface during HDD installation, or there is mud loss. Due to this HDD installation being beneath a river, it is virtually impossible to immediately identify a frac-out. Engineering studies of the sediments in the HDD alignment indicate a very low potential for frac-outs occurring during the water main installation that would migrate up the organic-rich strata or to the surface. A temporary steel conductor casing is planned for the entry and exit sides of the drill, specifically to reduce risks of inadvertent returns at these locations. Additionally, a site-specific frac-out management plan will be developed to best prepare for the unlikely occurrence of a frac-out during HDD activities. While the pipe installation by HDD methods is not anticipated to have any impact on the hydrology of water quality at the site, removal of the twelve timber piles along the Lynn shoreline will necessitate access to the shoreline. Due to the presumed depth of the piles, the timber pile bulkhead presents obstructions to the HDD route and must be removed to prevent a disturbance to the HDD operation. The twelve timber piles along the Lynn shoreline that will be removed are located on Tidal Flats and are regularly inundated at the base. As previously discussed, the dilapidated bulkhead provides no significant flood protection nor modulation of tidal action along the Lynn shoreline. Due to the age of the piles, it can be assumed that the treatment process utilized was creosote. Creosote is no longer allowed by environmental law except in very special cases. This is because creosote leaches from the timber structure upon which it has been applied and contaminates the adjacent soil and water. The removal of these piles will cease the creosote contamination. A turbidity curtain and floating debris boom will be placed to contain any creosote splinters or debris as the piles are removed. Several local marine pile driving firms have been contacted concerning the extraction of marine timber piles and the probability that these 90-year-old piles will break during the process. The firms indicated that extracting 60- and 70-foot-long creosoted timber piles are normally not a problem. The firms indicated that the piles tend to break in the tidal zone or just below the mudline where they have been either damaged by the sea, marine borers, or where they have deteriorated due to oxygenation. It is unlikely any piles would break and cause a greater environmental impact on the water quality than indicated herein. 5.7. Air Quality The project may increase the short-term potential for the release of pollutants to ambient air from dust associated with pipeline installation activities, as well as short-term emission releases from construction vehicles at the site. Best construction practices would be employed to reduce 31",
        "the impacts to air quality. This may include watering down of the construction access road during especially windy and dry days and reducing the idling times of construction vehicles. Due to the number of vehicles and duration of activity required to perform the work being limited, emissions are not anticipated to cause an exceedance of national or state air quality standards in the vicinity of the project site. 5.8. Noise Temporarily, increased noise levels would occur during pipeline installation activities. Factors contributing to this noise would be construction equipment and construction vehicles at the site. To minimize noise impacts during construction, best management practices (BMPs) would be implemented, including the use of mufflers on construction equipment and vehicles. 5.9. Traffic and Transportation For each of the locations listed below, MWRA will coordinate with DCR and the communities regard traffic management plans. Intersection of Route 1A and Hanson Street (Lynn): Construction at this intersection will consist of the installation of a proposed water main across Route 1A. The water main will cross along the southern approach of the intersection and then continue down Hanson Street. proposed temporary traffic control setup will involve a sequence of single-lane closures to cross the intersection. Only a single lane will be closed at any given time in either direction to maintain traffic flow along Route 1A. Temporary traffic control setups will be in place during off-peak traffic hours (overnight). This will minimize the impact to travelers on Route 1A and impacts to access points for nearby businesses. Parking restrictions and detours will not be required for this area of work. Hanson Street (Lynn): Construction on Hanson Street will consist of the installation of a proposed water main located in the southern shoulder. The proposed temporary traffic control setup will involve a sequence of shoulder closures along the south side of Hanson Street. To maintain existing driveway access points for businesses on Hanson Street, only one driveway will be blocked at any given time. Existing pedestrian facilities will be maintained, and a fence will be provided on the edge of the sidewalk. Temporary traffic control setups will be in place during off-peak traffic hours (6 pm to 6 am). Parking restrictions and detours will not be required for this area of work. Rice Ave (Revere): Construction on Rice Ave will consist of the installation of a proposed water main located outside the roadway in the grass strip on the north side of Rice Avenue. There is approximately 250’ of proposed water main located within the roadway near the intersection of Rice Ave and Whitin Ave (northwest of the yacht club). The proposed temporary traffic control setup at the intersection of Whitin Ave and Rice Ave will involve narrowing the roadway and maintaining all existing traffic movements. Construction vehicles and equipment will be located off the roadway on the north side of Rice Ave to provide a minimum of one travel lane. The section of water main installation on Rice Ave between Whitin Ave and Fowler Ave will require a short section of alternating one-way traffic with a police officer to direct vehicles during construction hours. The roadway will be covered with steel plates at the end of each work shift so that no alternating one-way setup will be required during off-peak hours. No further traffic control setups are required. 32",
        "5.10. Aesthetic Resources/Open Space/Recreational Resources During construction, there would be aesthetic impacts in the immediate vicinity of Rice Avenue, Hanson Street, the HDD Staging Areas, and the timber pile removal site. In the long term, the area would return to its current aesthetics. As identified in Section 4.9. DCR owns and maintains the verge between the Lynnway and North Shore Road, immediately west of the intersection between Rice Avenue and the Lynnway. MWRA is working with MassDCR to determine Article 97 applicability. In Lynn, the area that appears to be used for passive recreation will be restricted from public access during construction activities. Following activities, the area would return to its current aesthetics. 5.11. Socioeconomic Characteristics / Environmental Justice As discussed in Section 4.11.3, the Project Site is within two environmental justice populations, and the project’s DGA is either in whole or in part within twenty-nine additional environmental justice populations. The EJ Screening Forms in Attachment I have maps that show EJ block groups within the DGA and are color-coded by EJ criteria. The complete list of environmental justice block groups within five miles of the project site can also be found in Attachment I. The project site is within two environmental justice block groups, those being Block Group 1, Census Tract 2072 (Lynn) and Block Group 1, Census Tract 1705.02 (Revere). Because the proposed project would return to service the Section 56 water main, the primary long-term benefit to both EJ and non-EJ populations of this project would be water supply system redundancy and reliability. A reliable water supply system protects public health and environmental health. The project would also have beneficial short-term effects on the economy due to a temporary increase in construction-related jobs, increasing employment opportunities for the construction workforce, and increasing revenues of local businesses and government generated from construction activities and workers. However, any increase would be temporary, lasting only for the duration of the construction The following impacts may affect environmental justice populations as well as the wider public and will be mitigated to the maximum extent practicable: • Short-term impacts to traffic on Rice Avenue would impact residents on this street during the installation of the pipeline in the roadway. Increased activity in the vicinity of the project site, including the Point of Pines parking lot, would temporarily disrupt local traffic. • Short-term impacts to traffic on Hanson Street would impact traffic patterns in the commercial/industrial vicinity during the installation of the pipeline in the roadway. • Short-term impacts on air quality in the project area could result from the temporary operation of machinery associated with construction activities. Best management practices (BMPs) to control construction emissions would be implemented to minimize visible fugitive dust emissions at the property line. • Short-term impacts to noise levels in the project area would occur during construction, primarily from mechanical equipment used for construction activities. • Short-term impacts to the access to the Community Path of Lynn and a segment of a walking/biking trail that goes along the waterfront. This area would be restricted from public access due to its proximity to the project site. 33",
        "These impacts are not expected to disproportionately impact EJ populations. The project would result in the following benefits to environmental justice populations as well as the wider public: • MWRA's Section 56 Water Pipeline provides water to residents and businesses in the cities of Revere and Lynn. This project will ensure water system redundancy and reliability, which is crucial to protect both public health and environmental health. Replacement of this pipeline will ensure continued water supply for consumption, fire protection, and sanitation. The EJ populations served by this pipeline, as well as the wider community, will benefit from the security that this pipeline replacement will bring to the area's water supply. As discussed in Section 4.11.3, Attachment G provides the output generated from the RMAT Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool. The RMAT Tool output indicates “High Exposure” preliminary climate change exposure and risk ratings for sea level rise/storm surge, extreme precipitation – urban flooding, and extreme heat, and notes that the proposed project is within a mapped environmental justice population. As previously discussed, once the construction is complete, the project will be underground. This inherent aspect of the project design mitigates risk to the infrastructure. The project will also ensure water system redundancy and increased resiliency to the impacts of climate change. 6. Cumulative Impacts Any planned large projects in the area of the Saugus River Crossing that would occur around the same time as the proposed pipeline installation have the potential to interact with the proposed project, and, as such, are evaluated here for potential cumulative impact. The following projects have been identified as large-scale projects that will be occurring in the area in the same timeframe as the proposed river crossing: • Lynn Landfill Cap Repair – The Lynn Landfill is a 22-acre site along the Lynn Harbor Shoreline (to the northeast of the proposed project site). The cap repair project seeks to ameliorate the landfill, which had been capped prior to Massachusetts enacting more stringent regulations. Coordination with this project includes citing the Lynn HDD Staging and Entry Area appropriately. • Lynn Harbor Park – Following the Lynn Landfill Cap Repair, the City of Lynn (in partnership with the Massachusetts EOEEA) will develop a harbor park on the same site. At this point in time, the project has documented site conditions, put forth a conceptual plan, and is now undergoing a stakeholder engagement process. It is anticipated that work on the harbor park will begin in the next two to three years. The Lynn Harbor Park will be situated to the northwest of the Saugus River Crossing staging area and Hanson Street pipeline installation, such that the projects’ impacts will not directly overlap with one another. Only the proposed pipe string layout area extends far north enough to potentially overlap with construction activities for the Harbor Park. Coordination between the two projects will be required. The pipe string layout area (and the majority of the project area) are in Land Subject to Coastal Storm Flowage (LSCSF, coincident with the FEMA 100-Year Floodplain). If these two projects end up occurring simultaneously, temporary impacts to this resource area may be increased. Additionally, construction traffic in the area could be heightened. • Lynn Harbor Property LLC – This is a proposed 550-unit residential development adjacent to the project area in Lynn on the site of the former Lynnway Mart. The project underwent 34",
        "MEPA review between 2019 and 2021. MWRA is aware of the project intends to be closely coordinating with the project proponent. 7. Mitigation Erosion and sedimentation controls would be employed, including installing coir wattles downslope limits of grading, to minimize the potential for offsite sedimentation and erosion. Details of typical controls are illustrated on Sheets C-1 and C-2 in Attachment D. In the event a barge will be used to extract the timber piles along the Lynn shoreline, bottoming out will be avoided by floating the barge further from the shoreline as low tide approaches. A turbidity curtain will be installed around the perimeter of the pile removal work. Temporary devices and structures to control erosion and sedimentation in and around the site would be properly maintained at all times and removed and properly disposed of as soon as the site is stabilized following activities to rectify impacts, but no later than November 1, three full growing seasons following the completion of site activities. Stockpiles of sediment will be surrounded by erosion controls. Any sediment collected by these devices would be removed and placed in an upland location in a manner that prevents erosion and transport to any waterway or wetland resource area. A frac-out plan will be prepared by the contractor and submitted to the local Conservation Commissions before construction activities commence. A traffic management plan will be prepared in consultation with DCR and the two communities to mitigate temporary traffic disruption. Waste materials, debris, and trash would be cleaned from the work site at the end of each day and placed in trash barrels and/or dumpsters which would be disposed of off-site. At no time during construction is the dumping of spoils material, waste, or other debris allowed into any wetland area or other unspecified location. Concrete debris from demolition would be removed from wetland resource areas and stockpiled in the upland staging area while awaiting proper disposal. General construction safety procedures would be followed to prevent accidents that could result in spills, releases, or other environmental damage. Activities such as fueling operations and hot work would be monitored and conducted away from sensitive resource areas when possible. As indicated above, mitigation for dust would include watering down the construction access road and vehicles, as needed, especially during especially windy and dry days, and reducing the idling times of construction vehicles. To minimize noise impacts during construction, best management practices (BMPs) would include mufflers on construction equipment and vehicles. 8. Required Permits MWRA will coordinate closely with the local communities throughout the duration of the project to keep surrounding residents, businesses, and community organizations apprised of information regarding the project. The following permits/approvals are anticipated to be needed to implement the proposed project: Local Permits • Order of Conditions from the Lynn Conservation Commission under the Massachusetts Wetland Protection Act and the City of Lynn General Wetland Protection By-Law (following submission of a Notice of Intent) 35",
        "• Order of Conditions from the Revere Conservation Commission under the Massachusetts Wetland Protection Act and City of Revere Code of Ordinances Chapter 16.04 (Wetlands Protection) (following submission of a Notice of Intent) • City of Lynn Highway Engineering Department Street Opening Permit • City of Revere Highway Engineering Department Street Opening Permit State Permits • Consistency Determination from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management • MassDEP Chapter 91 Waterways License • MassDEP Distribution Modifications for systems • MassDOT Permit to Access State Highway • Department of Conservation and Recreation Access Permit • Massachusetts Historical Commission Section 106 Review • Division of Fisheries and Wildlife Natural Heritage and Endangered Species • Massachusetts Water Resources Authority Section 8(m) permit • Amended or new Massachusetts State Archaeology Permit • Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) review thresholds require an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the alteration of 10 acres or more of any “other” wetlands (301 CMR 11.03(3)(1)(a) if a state Permit is required. As noted above, the proposed project would require multiple state permits. Although direct, permanent wetland impacts will not exceed 10 acres of alteration of any “other” wetlands, two MEPA thresholds are exceeded by this project. They are as follows: - 11.03(3)(b)(1)(e): “New fill or structure of Expansion of existing fill or structure, except a pile-supported structure in a velocity zone or regulatory floodway.” - 11.03(3)(b)(1)(a): this review threshold is met when a permit is required for the alteration of coastal dune, barrier beach or coastal bank. Because the project area is located within the Designated Geographic Area (DGA) around an Environmental Justice Population, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required per 301 CMR 11.06(7)(b).

        "Scoring Rationale - Project Exposure Score The purpose of the Exposure Score output is to provide a preliminary assessment of whether the overall project site and subsequent assets are exposed to impacts of natural hazard events and/or future impacts of climate change. For each climate parameter, the Tool will calculate one of the following exposure ratings: Not Exposed, Low Exposure, Moderate Exposure, or High Exposure. The rationale behind the exposure rating is provided below. Sea Level Rise/Storm Surge This project received a \"High Exposure\" because of the following: Located within the predicted mean high water shoreline by 2030 Exposed to the 1% annual coastal flood event as early as 2030 Historic coastal flooding at project site Extreme Precipitation - Urban Flooding This project received a \"High Exposure\" because of the following: Maximum annual daily rainfall exceeds 10 inches within the overall project's useful life No historic flooding at project site No increase to impervious area Existing impervious area of the project site is between 10% and 50% Extreme Precipitation - Riverine Flooding This project received a \"Not Exposed\" because of the following: No historic riverine flooding at project site The project is not within a mapped FEMA floodplain [outside of the Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM)] Project is more than 500ft from a waterbody Project is not likely susceptible to riverine erosion Extreme Heat This project received a \"High Exposure\" because of the following: 30+ days increase in days over 90 deg. F within project's useful life Less than 10% of the existing project site has canopy cover Located within 100 ft of existing water body No increase to the impervious area of the project site No tree removal Scoring Rationale - Asset Preliminary Climate Risk Rating A Preliminary Climate Risk Rating is determined for each infrastructure and building asset by considering the overall project Exposure Score and responses to Step 4 questions provided by the user in the Tool. Natural Resource assets do not receive a risk rating. The following factors are what influenced the risk ratings for each asset. Asset - Return to service of the Section 56 Water Main that supplies potable water to for the MWRA Northern High Service Zone. Primary asset criticality factors influencing risk ratings for this asset: Asset can be inaccessible/inoperable more than a week after natural hazard event without consequences Loss/inoperability of the asset would have regional impacts The infrastructure provides services to populations that reside within Environmental Justice neighborhoods or climate vulnerable populations. Inoperability of the asset would not be expected to result in injuries Inoperability may moderately impact other facilities, assets, or buildings, but is not expected to affect their ability to operate There are no hazardous materials in the asset Page 2 of 12",
        "Project Climate Resilience Design Standards Output Climate Resilience Design Standards and Guidance are recommended for each asset and climate parameter. The Design Standards for each climate parameter include the following: recommended planning horizon (target and/or intermediate), recommended return period (Sea Level Rise/Storm Surge and Precipitation) or percentile (Heat), and a list of applicable design criteria that are likely to be affected by climate change. Some design criteria have numerical values associated with the recommended return period and planning horizon, while others have tiered methodologies with step-by-step instructions on how to estimate design values given the other recommended design standards. Asset: Return to service of the Section 56 Water Main that supplies Infrastructure potable water to for the MWRA Northern High Service Zone. Sea Level Rise/Storm Surge High Risk Target Planning Horizon: 2070 Intermediate Planning Horizon: 2050 Return Period: 50-yr (2%) LIMITATIONS: The recommended Climate Resilience Design Standards for the Sea Level Rise / Storm Surge Design Criteria are based on the user drawn polygon and relationships as defined in the Supporting Documents. The projected values provided through the Tool are based on the Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM) outputs as of 9/13/2021, which included GIS-based data for three planning horizons (2030, 2050, 2070) and six return periods (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%). These values are projections based on assumptions as defined in the model and the LiDAR used at the time.

The projected Total Precipitation Depth values provided through the Tool are based on the climate projections developed by Cornell University as part of EEA's Massachusetts Climate and Hydrologic Risk Project, GIS-based data as of 10/15/21. For additional information on the methodology of these precipitation outputs, see Supporting Documents. While Total Precipitation Depth & Peak Intensity for 24-hour Design Storms are useful to inform planning and design, it is recommended to also consider additional longer- and shorter-duration precipitation events and intensities in accordance with best practices. Longer-duration, lower-intensity storms allow time for infiltration and reduce the load on infrastructure over the duration of the storm. Shorter-duration, higher-intensity storms often have higher runoff volumes because the water does not have enough time to infiltrate infrastructure systems (e.g., catch basins) and may overflow or back up during such storms, resulting in flooding. In the Northeast, short-duration high intensity rain events are becoming more frequent, and there is often little early warning for these events, making it difficult to plan operationally. While the Tool does not provide recommended design standards for these scenarios, users should still consider both short- and long-duration precipitation events and how they may impact the asset.

No Is this project being submitted as part of a regulatory review process or permitting? Yes Brief Project Description: MWRA is proposing the replacement of the portion of the Section 56 water main below the riverbed of the Saugus River between Lynn and Revere to restore water supply redundancy. This section previously crossed the river via General Edwards Bridge and was removed from the system in 2019 due to severe corrosion. The section installed via HDD would tie into the existing water main via sections of water main installed by traditional cut and cover methods along Hanson Street and Rice Avenue in Lynn and Revere, respectively. Project Submission Comments: The purpose of this project is a return to service of an existing water main. A portion that previously crossed the Saugus River via the General Edwards Bridge was removed in 2019. Since then, the water supply system of the MWRA Northern High Service Zone has had no redundancy and has been vulnerable to failure. Because the replacement must tie into the existing pipeline, relocation of this project is not possible. Additionally, the entire project will be underground, with the only surface impacts being six manholes with existing paved roadways. Considerations regarding climate exposure are not particularly relevant to this project.

Y/N/ unknown Estimated GHG emissions of conditioned spaces (click Not applicable. here for GHG Estimation tool) Project Description 1. Provide a brief project description, including overall size of the project site and square footage of proposed buildings and structures if known. The Massachusetts Water Resource Authority (MWRA) is proposing to replace a section of its existing Section 56 water pipeline. Section 56 provides water service to the cities of Lynn and Revere. The section of this water pipeline to be replaced was previously attached to the General Edwards Bridge over the Saugus River (which is also Lynn/Revere municipal border) but had to be removed in 2018 due to severe corrosion. MWRA now proposes to replace this section of water pipeline by installing a new section of water pipeline under the water of the Saugus River, using both open-cut and trenchless underwater pipeline construction methods. MWRA’s Section 56 Water Pipeline Replacement Project will ensure water system redundancy and reliability for residents and businesses in these communities, which is crucial to protecting public and environmental health. After the construction is complete, the only existing surface impacts will be approximately six manholes, which will be flush with the paved surfaces of Rice Avenue in Revere and Hanson Street in Lynn and/or in a grassy traffic island at the entrance to North Shore Road in Revere. Specific project activities include: • Installation of a 20-inch water main under the Saugus River using horizontal 1",
        "directional drilling (HDD) methods. • Installation of a 20-inch water main, including fittings, valves, air release valves, and blow-offs in Rice Avenue in Revere, from the Saugus River HDD crossing point at the Point of Pines Yacht Club to the existing Section 56 pipeline between the Route 1A northbound on-ramp and the Lynnway. • Installation of 20-inch diameter water main and appurtenances, including fittings, valves, air release valves, and blow-offs in Hanson Street in Lynn, from the existing Section 56 pipeline in Route 1A to the Saugus River HDD crossing point at the end of Hanson Street/Riley Way Extension • Installation of environmental controls and traffic management, replacement of utilities, surface restoration, road reconstruction/pavement restoration, and sidewalk reconstruction. • The removal of twelve timber piles from the deteriorated seawall on the Lynn shoreline. • Temporary staging/HDD entry/exit pits at the Point of Pines Yacht Club parking lot in Revere and at the end of Hanson Street/Riley Way Extension in Lynn. The total area of temporary disturbance is 2.9 acres. There are no proposed permanent above-ground buildings or structures. 2. List anticipated MEPA review thresholds (301 CMR 11.03) (if known) • 301 CMR 11.03(3)(b)(1)(e), which states: “New fill or structure or Expansion of existing fill or structure, except a pile-supported structure, in a velocity zone or regulatory floodway.” • 301 CMR 11.03(3)(b)(1)(a), regarding “alteration of coastal dune, barrier beach or coastal bank.” 3. List all anticipated state, local and federal permits needed for the project (if known) MA WPA Notice of Intent (Order of Conditions anticipated from Revere and Lynn) MassDEP 401 Water Quality Certification Mass CZM Coastal Zone Consistency Determination MWRA 8M Permit MassDOT Street Opening Permit, Revere MassDOT Street Opening Permit, Lynn MassDCR Construction Access Permit Massachusetts Historical Commission Project Notification Form (PNF) and National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 Compliance US Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 and 408 Permits Chapter 91 Massachusetts Public Waterfront Act License 4. Identify EJ populations and characteristics (Minority, Income, English Isolation) within 5 miles of project site (can attach map identifying 5-mile radius from EJ Maps Viewer in lieu of narrative) Within 5 miles of the project site, there are EJ block groups with the following characteristics: Minority; Income; English isolation; Minority and income; Minority and English isolation; Income and English isolation; Minority, Income, and English isolation. The attached map shows the 5-mile radius from the EJ Maps Viewer. 2",
        "5. Identify any municipality or census tract meeting the definition of “vulnerable health EJ criteria” in the DPH EJ Tool located in whole or in part within a 1-mile radius of the project site There are three municipalities in part within a 1-mile radius of the project site. These are Lynn, Revere, and Saugus. • Lynn meets two of the Vulnerable Health EJ Criteria: Lead Poisoning (29 BLL >= ug/dL Prevalence per 1,000) and Asthma ED Visits (130 per 10,000). For these two criteria, the rate or prevalence in Lynn is greater than 110% the rate or prevalence for the state as a whole. • Revere also meets two Criteria: Heart Attack (30%) and Asthma ED Visits (111 Visits per 10,000). For these two criteria, the rate or prevalence in Revere is greater than 110% the rate or prevalence for the state as a whole. • Saugus does not exceed any of the four Vulnerable Health EJ Criteria. For all four criteria, the rate or prevalence in Saugus is less than 110% the rate or prevalence for the state as a whole. 6. Identify potential short-term and long-term environmental and public health impacts that may affect EJ Populations and any anticipated mitigation The following impacts may affect EJ populations as well as the wider public: - Short-term impacts to traffic on Rice Avenue would impact residents on this street during the installation of pipeline in the roadway. Increased activity in the vicinity of the project site, including the Point of Pines parking lot, would temporarily disrupt local traffic. - Short-term impacts to traffic on Hanson Street would impact traffic patterns in the commercial/industrial vicinity during the installation of pipeline in the roadway. - Short-term impacts to air quality in the project area could result from the temporary operation of machinery associated with construction activities. Best management practices (BMPs) to control construction emissions would be implemented to minimize dust and emission. - Short-term impacts to noise levels in the project area would occur during construction, primarily from mechanical equipment used for construction activities. Noise impacts will be minimized to the extent feasible through measures including preventing unnecessary vehicle idling. - Short-term impacts to public access to the Community Path of Lynn and a segment of adjacent waterfront walking/biking trail during construction. These impacts are not expected to disproportionately impact EJ populations. 7. Identify project benefits, including “Environmental Benefits” as defined in 301 CMR 11.02, that may improve environmental conditions or public health of the EJ population The project would result in the following benefits to EJ populations as well as the wider public: - MWRA's Section 56 Water Pipeline provides water to residents and businesses in the cities of Revere and Lynn. This project will ensure water system redundancy and reliability, which is crucial to protecting public and environmental health. Replacement of this pipeline will ensure continued water supply for consumption, fire protection, and sanitation. The EJ populations served by this pipeline, as well as the wider community, will 3",
        "benefit from the security that this pipeline replacement will bring to the area's water supply. 8. Describe how the community can request a meeting to discuss the project, and how the community can request oral language interpretation services at the meeting. Specify how to request other accommodations, including meetings after business hours and at locations near public transportation.

Это Линн, Ревир и Саугус. • Линн соответствует двум критериям экологической справедливости для уязвимого здоровья населения: Отравление свинцом (уровень свинца в крови 29 >= мкг/дл, распространённость на 1000 человек) и посещения отделения неотложной помощи в связи с астмой (130 на 10 000 человек). По этим двум критериям уровень или распространённость в Линне более чем на 110% превышает уровень или распространённость в штате в целом. • Ревир также соответствует двум критериям: Сердечный приступ (30%) и посещения отделения неотложной помощи в связи с астмой (111 посещений на 10 000 человек). По этим двум критериям уровень или распространённость в Ревире более чем на 110% превышает уровень или распространённость в штате в целом. • В Саугусе не превышен ни один из четырёх критериев экологической справедливости для уязвимого здоровья населения. По всем четырём критериям уровень или распространённость в Саугусе меньше, чем 110% от уровня или распространённости в штате в целом. 6. Определите потенциальное краткосрочное и долгосрочное воздействие на окружающую среду и общественное здоровье, которое может затронуть население с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости, и любые предполагаемые меры по минимизации такого воздействия. Следующие виды воздействия могут затронуть население с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости, а также более широкую общественность: - Краткосрочное воздействие на движение транспорта по Райс Авеню затронет 3",
        "жителей этой улицы во время прокладки водопроводных труб на проезжей части. Повышенная активность вблизи участка проекта, включая стоянку у яхт-клуба «Пойнт оф Пайнс», может временно нарушить местное движение. - Краткосрочное воздействие на движение транспорта по Хэнсон Стрит повлияет на схему движения в близлежащем коммерческом/промышленном районе во время прокладки водопроводных труб на проезжей части. - Может иметь место краткосрочное воздействие на качество воздуха в районе выполнения проекта из-за временной работы техники в связи со строительными работами. Для контроля строительных выбросов будут применяться передовые методы управления (BMP), чтобы минимизировать пыль и выбросы. - Во время строительства будет иметь место краткосрочное воздействие на уровни шума в районе выполнения проекта, в основном от механического оборудования, используемого для строительных работ. Шумовое воздействие будет сведено к минимуму, насколько это возможно, при помощи конкретных мер, включая предотвращение ненужного простоя транспортных средств. - Краткосрочное воздействие на доступ населения к Общественной тропе Линна и участку прилегающей пешеходной/велосипедной дорожки на набережной во время строительства. Ожидается, что эти виды воздействия не окажут непропорционального влияния на население с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости. 7. Определите преимущества проекта, включая «Преимущества для окружающей среды», согласно определению, приведённому в CMR, раздел 301, 11.02, которые могут улучшить экологические условия или общественное здоровье населения с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости В результате проекта будут достигнуты следующие преимущества для населения с особыми требованиями к экологической справедливости, а также для более широкой общественности: - «MWRA, участок 56, проект по замене водопроводных труб» предоставляет водоснабжение для жителей и предприятий в городах Ревир и Линн.

Proporcione una breve descripción del proyecto, incluyendo el tamaño total del sitio del proyecto y las áreas en pies cuadrados de las estructuras y los edificios propuestos, si se conocen. Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), que es a autoridad de recursos hídricos de Massachusetts, propone sustituir una sección de su actual tubería de agua de la Sección 56. La Sección 56 suministra agua a las ciudades de Lynn y Revere. La sección de esta tubería de agua que se reemplazará estaba previamente unida al Puente General Edwards sobre el Río Saugus (que también es frontera municipal entre Lynn y Revere), pero tuvo que ser retirada en 2018 debido a una severa corrosión. MWRA ahora propone reemplazar esta sección de tubería de agua instalando una nueva sección de tubería de agua bajo el agua del Río Saugus, utilizando métodos de construcción de tuberías submarinas tanto a cielo abierto como sin zanjas. El proyecto de reemplazo de la tubería de agua de la Sección 56 de la MWRA asegurará la redundancia y confiabilidad del sistema de agua para los residentes y las empresas de estas comunidades, lo cual es crucial para proteger la salud pública y ambiental. Una vez finalizada la construcción, los únicos impactos superficiales existentes serán aproximadamente seis pozos de registro que quedarán al ras de las superficie pavimentada de Rice Avenue en Revere y Hanson Street en Lynn y/o en una isla de tráfico con césped a la entrada de North Shore Road en Revere. 1",
        "Entre las actividades específicas del proyecto se incluyen: • Instalación de una tubería principal de agua de 20 pulgadas (50 cm) bajo el Río Saugus utilizando métodos de Perforación Direccional Horizontal (HDD). • Instalación de una tubería principal de agua de 20 pulgadas (50 cm), incluyendo accesorios, válvulas, válvulas de purga de aire y purgadores en Rice Avenue en Revere, desde el punto de cruce de la HDD del Río Saugus en el club de yates Point of Pines hasta la tubería existente de la Sección 56 entre la rampa de acceso en dirección norte de la Route 1A y Lynnway. • Instalación de una tubería principal de agua de 20 pulgadas (50 cm) de diámetro y sus accesorios, incluyendo válvulas, válvulas de purga de aire y purgadores en Hanson Street en Lynn, desde la tubería existente de la Sección 56 en la Route 1A hasta el punto de cruce de la HDD del Río Saugus al final de Hanson Street/Riley Way Extension. • Instalación de controles ambientales y gestión del tráfico, reemplazo de servicios públicos, restauración de la superficie, reconstrucción del camino/restauración del pavimento y reconstrucción de las aceras. • Retirada de doce pilotes de madera del malecón deteriorado en la costa de Lynn. • Fosos temporales de entrada/salida de la HDD en el aparcamiento del club de yates Point of Pines en Revere y al final de Hanson Street/Riley Way Extension en Lynn. El área total de perturbación temporal es de 2.9 acres (1.17 hectáreas). No se proponen edificios ni estructuras permanentes sobre el suelo. 2.

        "4. Identifique las poblaciones y características de Justicia Ambiental (Environmental Justice (EJ)) (minorías, ingresos, aislamiento del inglés) en un radio de 5 millas (8 km) del lugar del proyecto (se puede adjuntar un mapa que identifique el radio de 5 millas (8 km) desde el visualizador de mapas EJ Maps Viewer en lugar de la descripción). Dentro de un radio de 5 millas (8 km) del sitio del proyecto, hay grupos de bloques de Justicia Ambiental (EJ) con las siguientes características: Minoría; Ingresos; Aislamiento del Inglés; Minoría e Ingresos; Minoría y Aislamiento del Inglés; Ingresos y Aislamiento del Inglés; Minoría, Ingresos y Aislamiento del Inglés. El mapa adjunto muestra el radio de 5 millas (8 km) del visualizador EJ Maps Viewer. 5. Identifique con la herramienta DPH EJ Tool cualquier municipio o tramo censal que cumpla con la definición de \"criterios de Justicia Ambiental de salud vulnerable\" y que esté ubicado total o parcialmente dentro de un radio de 1 milla (1.6 km) del sitio del proyecto. Hay tres municipios que están en parte dentro de un radio de 1 milla (1.6 km) del lugar del proyecto. Estos son Lynn, Revere y Saugus. • Lynn cumple con dos de los criterios de Justicia Ambiental de salud vulnerable: Envenenamiento por plomo (29 BLL >= ug/dL de Prevalencia por cada 1,000) y Visitas al Departamento de Urgencias (ED) por Asma (130 por cada 10,000). Para estos dos criterios, la tasa o prevalencia en Lynn es superior al 110% de la tasa o prevalencia en el estado en su conjunto. • Revere también cumple dos criterios: Ataque cardíaco (30%) y Visitas al Departamento de Urgencias por Asma (111 visitas por cada 10,000). Para estos dos criterios, la tasa o prevalencia en Revere es superior al 110% de la tasa o prevalencia para el estado en su conjunto. • Saugus no excede ninguno de los cuatro Criterios de Justicia Ambiental de Salud Vulnerable. Para los cuatro criterios, la tasa o prevalencia en Saugus es inferior al 110% de la tasa o prevalencia para el estado en su conjunto. 6. Identifique los posibles impactos ambientales y de salud pública a corto y largo plazo que puedan afectar a las poblaciones de Justicia Ambiental y cualquier mitigación anticipada Los siguientes impactos pueden afectar a las poblaciones de Justicia Ambiental así como al público en general: - Los impactos a corto plazo en el tráfico en Rice Avenue afectarían a los residentes de esta avenida durante la instalación de la tubería en el camino. El aumento de la actividad en las inmediaciones del sitio del proyecto, incluyendo el aparcamiento de Point of Pines, perturbaría temporalmente el tráfico local. - Los impactos a corto plazo sobre el tráfico en Hanson Street afectarían a los patrones de tráfico en la vecindad comercial/industrial durante la instalación de la tubería en el camino. - Podría haber impactos a corto plazo en la calidad del aire en el área del proyecto por el funcionamiento temporal de la maquinaria utilizada en las actividades de construcción. Se aplicarían las mejores prácticas de gestión (BMP) para controlar las emisiones de la construcción con el fin de minimizar el polvo y las emisiones. - A corto plazo, habría un impacto en los niveles de ruido en la zona del proyecto durante la construcción, principalmente por los equipos mecánicos utilizados para las actividades de construcción. Los impactos sonoros se minimizarán en la medida de lo posible con medidas que incluyan la prevención de la actividad innecesaria de los motores en ralentí de los vehículos. - Impactos a corto plazo en el acceso público al Sendero Comunitario de Lynn y a un segmento del sendero adyacente para peatones y ciclistas a orillas del agua durante la construcción. 3",
        "No se espera que estos impactos afecten de manera desproporcionada a las poblaciones de Justicia Ambiental. 7. Identifique los beneficios del proyecto, incluyendo los \"Beneficios Ambientales\", tal como se definen en la norma 301 CMR 11.02, que pueden mejorar las condiciones ambientales o la salud pública de la población de Justicia Ambiental El proyecto traería consigo los siguientes beneficios para las poblaciones de Justicia Ambiental, así como para el público en general: - La tubería de agua de la Sección 56 de la MWRA suministra agua a los residentes y negocios de las ciudades de Revere y Lynn. Con este proyecto se asegurará la redundancia y fiabilidad del sistema de agua, que es crucial para proteger la salud pública y ambiental. Al reemplazar esta tubería se asegurará el suministro continuo de agua para el consumo, la protección contra incendios y el saneamiento. Las poblaciones de Justicia Ambiental que recibirán servicio por esta tubería, así como la comunidad en general, se beneficiarán por la seguridad que este reemplazo de tuberías dará al suministro de agua para la zona. 8. Describa cómo puede la comunidad solicitar una reunión para debatir el proyecto y cómo puede solicitar servicios de interpretación oral en la reunión. Especifique cómo solicitar otros ajustes, incluyendo reuniones fuera del horario laboral y en lugares cercanos al transporte público. Para solicitar ajustes, envíe un mensaje por correo electrónico o llame a: Katie Ronan, MWRA (617) 788-1177 katherine.ronan@mwra.com 4",

The Traffic Assessment and Control memo provides a comprehensive investigation and evaluation of all traffic related aspects of the Project. This includes: • Traffic impacts associated with temporary traffic control setups. • Construction vehicle routes. • Impacts to on street parking. • Construction work hour restrictions. Project Description The Section 56 Main Saugus River Crossing is a water main replacement project over the Saugus River between Lynn and Revere Massachusetts. The proposed water main will cross Route 1A at the intersection of Hanson Street and Route 1A then run parallel to Hanson Street on the south side. The water main will then cross the Saugus River at the end of Hanson Street (Lynn, MA) and connect to Rice Ave (Revere, MA). The water main will run parallel to Rice Ave on the north side and connect to the existing water main near the intersection of Whitin Ave and Lynnway. A figure of the proposed water main location is shown in Figure 1. 1/9",
        "Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Figure 1 – Proposed Water Main Location AECOM 2/9",
        "Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Description of Roadways The impacted roadways due to construction is shown in Table 1 with roadway classification and jurisdiction indicated. Route 1A: Route 1A is a multi-lane roadway that runs in the North/South direction connecting Boston in the South to Northeastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine in the North. The area of construction for this project occurs at the intersection of Route 1A and Hanson Street in Lynn, MA. This intersection is located in a commercially developed area with several businesses in the immediate vicinity. Business hours are generally 7AM to 9PM for businesses within 1,000 feet of the area of construction. There is no parking allowed on Route 1A. The lane configuration for each approach is as follows: • Route 1A Northbound: Three through lanes. • Hanson Street Westbound: One left turn lane and one right turn lane. • Route 1A Southbound: Three through lanes and one southbound left turn lane. Hanson Street: Hanson Street is approximately forty-five feet wide with one lane of traffic in each direction and two-hour parking allowed on both sides. Hanson street is a local street that provides access to two business developments from Route 1A. Hanson Street provides no connections to other roadways and is terminated on one end. At the road terminus there is a gate blocking vehicle access. There is a sidewalk on both sides of the road. Pedestrians may continue beyond the gate and access the Lynn Community Path. Rice Ave: Rice Ave ranges between approximately eighteen feet wide to twenty-two feet wide with one lane of traffic in each direction. No parking is permitted on Rice Ave. Rice Ave is a local street in a dense residential neighborhood. There is a non-continuous sidewalk on the north side of the street. Several side streets intersect with Rice Ave. These side streets are all one-way southbound roadways. Intersection of Rice Ave, Whitin Ave and Lynnway: Lynnway is a one-way street that provides access to Rice Ave and Whitin Ave from Route 1A. Whitin Ave is a one-way street in the southbound direction. Rice Ave is a two-direction street. Vehicles entering the intersection from Rice Ave must make a left turn on to Whitin Ave. Table 1.

A description of work, proposed traffic control setup, proposed working hours, parking restrictions, and detours for each impacted roadway are described in the following sections. Intersection of Route 1A and Hanson Street (Lynn, MA) Construction at this intersection will consist of installation of a proposed water main across Route 1A. The water main will cross along the southern approach of the intersection then continue down Hanson Street. AECOM 3/9",
        "Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Proposed traffic control setup: The proposed temporary traffic control setup will involve a sequence of single lane closures to cross the intersection. Only a single lane will be closed at any given time in either direction to maintain traffic flow along Route 1A. Proposed working hours: Temporary traffic control setups will be in place during off-peak traffic hours (overnight). This will minimize the impact to travelers on Route 1A and impacts to access points for nearby businesses. Parking restrictions and detours: Parking restrictions and detours will not be required for this area of work. Hanson Street (Lynn, MA) Construction on Hanson Street will consist of installation of a proposed water main located in the southern shoulder. Proposed traffic control setup: The proposed temporary traffic control setup will involve a sequence of shoulder closures along the south side of Hanson Street. To maintain existing driveway access points for businesses on Hanson Street, only one driveway will be blocked at any given time. Existing pedestrian facilities will be maintained, and a fence will be provided on the edge of the sidewalk. Proposed working hours: Temporary traffic control setups will be in place during off-peak traffic hours (6pm to 6am). Parking restrictions and detours: Parking restrictions and detours will not be required for this area of work. Rice Ave (Revere, MA) Construction on Rice Ave will consist of installation of a proposed water main located outside the roadway in the grass strip on the north side of Rice Avenue. There is approximately 250’ of proposed water main located within the roadway near the intersection of Rice Ave and Whitin Ave (northwest of the yacht club). Proposed traffic control setup: The proposed temporary traffic control setup at the intersection of Whitin Ave and Rice Ave will involve narrowing the roadway and maintaining all existing traffic movements. Construction vehicles and equipment will be located off the roadway on the north side of Rice Ave to provide a minimum of one travel lane. The section of water main installation on Rice Ave between Whitin Ave and Fowler Ave will require a short section of alternating one- way traffic with a police officer to direct vehicles during construction hours. The roadway will be covered with steel plates at the end of each work shift, so that no alternating one-way setup will be required during off-peak hours. No further traffic control setups are required for HDD Route 7. Special consideration if HDD Route 3 is selected In the instance that HDD Route 3 is selected, the installation of a water main along the full length of Rice Ave will require additional setup for traffic control with detours. The proposed temporary traffic control setup along Rice Ave will involve a sequence of eastbound traffic closures. Equipment and vehicles will be located on the north side of Rice Ave (in the westbound travel lane) and westbound traffic will be shifted to the south side of Rice Ave in the eastbound travel lane. Traffic will move in the westbound direction only for each work area. Segments will be short enough to maintain existing driveway and side street access. For every segment of construction, detour signage will be provided at the nearest upstream side street to re-route traffic down the side street and to Rice Ave westbound. Pedestrian sidewalks will be maintained through the duration of construction. Figure 2 below shows a typical work setup along Rice Ave with Rice Ave WB traffic shifted and Rice Ave EB traffic detoured down the nearest upstream side street. AECOM 4/9",
        "Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Figure 2 - Typical Rice Ave EB Detour Additionally, equipment staging at the end of Rice Ave will be required to install the water main across the Saugus River. Figure 3 below depicts the necessary equipment locations and space requirements to install the pipe across the Saugus River. This setup is only required for a short duration but will require a partial road closure and detour. Approximately five residences will lose vehicle access to their driveway and will require temporary off-site parking. Residents will need to access their home via the sidewalk from the off-site parking location. Construction schedules will be communicated in advance to these residences, so that they may plan accordingly. AECOM 5/9",
        "Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Figure 3 - Equipment Staging for HDD Route 3 AECOM 6/9",
        "Memo Section 56 Replacement Saugus River Crossing Proposed working hours: Construction activities will take place during daytime hours (8am to 5pm). Parking restrictions: There is currently no parking allowed on Rice Ave. This will be strictly enforced during construction to allow activities to take place. Detours: A detour will be required if HDD Route 3 is selected and provided for each segment of construction along Rice Ave as needed. Vehicles will be rerouted down a side street off Rice Ave and directed to make a left at the end of the street to Rice Ave and continue on Rice Ave WB until their destination. At the HDD-3 Exit Point, residential traffic will be rerouted for off-site parking. The standard temporary traffic control details that will be utilized during construction have been attached at the end of this memo. Construction Vehicle Access Construction vehicles are needed to remove debris from the site and to deliver new construction materials as the project proceeds. The impact of construction traffic in the peak hours is expected to be marginal due to off-hour deliveries and debris load-out. Truck activity is expected to be uniform for each area of construction work hours. In the case where HDD Route 7 is selected, construction vehicle access will be straightforward and construction vehicles will be able to drive to the construction site directly with little impact to surrounding residents. Construction vehicles will be able to have enough room to maneuver at the Point of Pines Yacht Club and thereby limit the need for specific routes for construction vehicles. Special consideration if HDD Route 3 is selected In the event HDD Route 3 is selected, AECOM is requiring trucks use specific routes to access each work zone. A truck circulation plan is provided in Figure 4 that depicts the truck routes. These selected truck routes are based upon: • The directionality of side streets. • The narrow width of Rice Ave and inability of trucks to reverse direction. It is anticipated that all trucks arriving at the work site on Rice Ave will not be able to reverse direction. For this reason, arrival routes will have two categories: trucks arriving from the west and trucks arriving from the east (Figure 4 Green Routes). Trucks arriving on Rice Ave from the west: • Make a left on to Lynnway from Route 1A exit ramp • Make right on to Rice Ave Trucks arriving on Rice Ave from the east: • Make a left on to Lynnway from Route 1A exit ramp • Make a right on to Whitin Ave • Make a left on to Rice Ave Similarly, it is anticipated that departing trucks will not be able to reverse direction. For this reason, departing routes will have two categories: trucks departing Rice Ave and going west and trucks departing Rice Ave and going east (Figure 4 Red Routes). Westbound trucks departing Rice Ave: • Continue on Rice Ave • Turn left to Whitin Ave • Turn Right to Rice Ave • Turn Right to Chamberlain Ave • Turn to Route 1A AECOM 7/9",

        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) Section 56 water transmission main supplies meters in the City of Revere and the City of Lynn, and provides service to the Northern High Service Zone communities of Lynn, Nahant, Swampscott and Marblehead. The 20-inch diameter steel water transmission main has been taken out-of-service at its crossing of the Saugus River due to a history of leaks and bursts. The MWRA wishes to evaluate options to restore reliable water transmission through Section 56 at its crossing of the Saugus River. The MWRA secured Weston & Sampson to perform a feasibility study to evaluate rehabilitation and replacement alternatives for a future capital improvements project. The Weston & Sampson project team, including sub consultants McMillen Jacobs Associates and Green International Affiliates, performed feasibility study services from December 2015 to May 2017. Tasks included field reconnaissance, review of existing conditions records, evaluation of installation methods and route alternatives, screening and ranking of alternatives, and detailed study of the two highly ranked route alternatives. The team coordinated progress with the MWRA through memoranda detailing work progress and periodic project meetings. Field reconnaissance and pipe inspection revealed that the existing pipe and pipe supports are generally in poor condition. The existing conditions review identified known environmental releases in the area, subsurface conditions near the bridge alignment, general nature of historic and existing structures, applicable resource area limits, abutters, and development interests in the project area. Eight (8) potential pipe replacement route alignments were identified in the project area. Four (4) pipe installation methods were considered, including open trench river crossing, horizontal directional drilling, microtunneling, and removal and replacement on the bridge. Route alternatives were screened with respect to pipeline performance, program risks, cost, and schedule. Screening and ranking identified two highly rated horizontal directional drilling (HDD) pipe replacement alternatives extending from Hanson Street in the City of Lynn to Rice Avenue in the City of Revere (Route 3 and Route 7). The microtunneling alternative was rated favorably from a performance and risk perspective, but had the highest cost and a longer schedule duration. The open trench river crossing alternative was comparable in cost to HDD options, but included greater environmental risk, greater permitting difficulty, and a longer schedule duration. The pipe replacement on bridge alternative scored less favorably due to reduced protection against damage, hydraulic limitations, greater technical complexity, and greater construction risk. Weston & Sampson recommends that Route 3 and Route 7 be carried forward into preliminary design. Both HDD routes shares drill entry on Hanson Street in Lynn. Route 3 has drill exit near the end of the Point of Pines on Rice Avenue, and Route 7 has drill exit near the Point of Pines Yacht Club off Rice Avenue. Route 3 is viewed as having less risk of conflict with known and unknown structures due to its orientation relative to the Lynn Seawall and other obstructions, as well as its location outside of the historically developed areas inside the mouth of the Saugus River, among other advantages. Route 7 is of lower cost and lower construction duration, among other advantages. Risks associated with obstruction by the seawall, easement acquisition, and abutter concerns will be fully evaluated and better understood in preliminary design after execution of the recommended subsurface exploration program, engagement of abutters, and initiation of access/easement negotiation. Route 3 has an estimated program cost of $10,651,147, requires 7-months of construction operations, and has an estimated project completion date in October 2021. Route 7 has an estimated program cost of $9,947,248, requires about 6-months of construction operations, and has an estimated project completion date in September 2021.

        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 1.0 INTRODUCTION The MWRA wishes to evaluate the most feasible, cost-effective, methodology for replacing the Section 56 water main where it crosses the Saugus River on the General Edwards Bridge between the City of Revere and the City of Lynn, Massachusetts. Weston & Sampson was retained under Contract 7500, Engineering Services to Conduct Feasibility Study for Section 56 General Edwards Bridge Crossing of the Saugus River (the Project), to perform professional services in support of this goal. 1.1 General Section 56 at the General Edwards Bridge was constructed in 1934. The water main is buried 20-inch diameter cast iron pipe in its approaches to the bridge in the City of Revere (Revere Beach Boulevard and the Lynnway) and the City of Lynn (the Lynnway). The water main crosses the Saugus River supported by the General Edwards Bridge superstructure, except through the navigation channel, where the Figure 1 – Overview of Section 56 water main passes below the existing navigation channel via a tunnel. The buried 20-inch diameter cast iron pipe in streets transitions to 20- inch diameter flanged steel pipe on the General Edwards Bridge and 30-inch diameter steel pipe at the tunnel system. Section 56 supplies water to residential, commercial and industrial properties in Revere and Lynn, and provides redundancy for Sections 27 and 91 that service the Northern High Service Zone communities of Lynn, Nahant, Swampscott and Marblehead. Section 56 has experienced several leaks and bursts, with a considerable number at the bridge crossing, where the above-grade portions of the pipe have experienced severe corrosion. Section 56 is currently shutdown at meter 126 because of the leaks and bursts. Section 27 and Section 91 cross the Saugus River north of its confluence with the Pines River. Section 26 is currently out of service at the Salem Turnpike river crossing. 1.2 Purpose The MWRA wishes to restore reliable water transmission through Section 56 at its crossing of the Saugus River. This feasibility study was to evaluate pipe rehabilitation and replacement alternatives and recommend the most favorable alternative that meets the MWRA’s long term goals for reliable water system performance in the project area. Alternatives evaluation was to include water main replacement 1-1 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY on the bridge, open trench water main installation, and water main installation via trenchless installation methods. Alternatives were evaluated for technical feasibility, estimated costs, potential environmental impacts, permit requirements, easement/land acquisition requirements, potential utility conflicts, traffic impacts, connections to the existing pipe, installation of valves and other appurtenances and estimated construction schedule. The results of this study are intended to be used to guide the design of the Section 56 water main replacement. The project does not address replacing existing below-grade portions of Section 56 in Revere or Lynn. 1.3 Project Team The Project team included Weston & Sampson as the engineering lead and McMillen Jacobs Associates and Green International Affiliates as subconsultants. Weston & Sampson’s organization and management approach for was intended to maximize the expertise brought by each team member. A Quality Assurance and Quality Control Manual was prepared to detailed staff organization and role responsibility. The majority of work was provided by Weston & Sampson from their headquarters in Peabody, Massachusetts. Support evaluating trenchless technology options was provided by McMillen Jacobs Associates from their Burlington Massachusetts office. Inspection of the existing Section 56 water main, and support of the on bridge pipe replacement alternative, was provided by Green International Affiliates, from their Westford Massachusetts office. 1.4 Schedule Overview The Project Notice to Proceed was issued on December 4, 2015. Field reconnaissance began on December 14, 2015, and concluded with a memorandum dated February 25, 2016. Review of existing records was performed in the first quarter of 2016. Memoranda summarizing environmental and geotechnical records review were submitted in April 2016. Installation methods and route alignments were evaluated in the first and second quarters of 2016. A draft memorandum summarizing installation methods and route alternatives was submitted in April 2016. Screening and ranking of alternatives was performed in the second quarter of 2016 and Figure 2- General Edwards Bridge North Elevation results were submitted in July 2016. A workshop was held in September 2016 to discuss installation methods, route alternatives, and screening and ranking. In the months following the workshop, various meetings with stakeholders were conducted. In November 2016, revised route alternatives and screening and ranking memoranda were finalized. The MWRA authorized Weston & Sampson to proceed with a detailed review of the recommended alternative in January 2017. The MWRA expanded the scope of detailed review in February 2017 via contract Task Order 3. Detailed review deliverables were submitted in March 2017. This Final Report was submitted in June 2017. 1-2 westonandsampson.com",

        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 2.0 EXISTING BRIDGE AND PIPELINE Field reconnaissance and pipeline inspection were performed at the General Edwards Bridge as part of the Project. Inspection revealed that the existing Section 56 water main supported on the General Edwards Bridge is in poor to serious condition. Typical pitting on the exterior of the water main was 0.125 to 0.25 inches deep. Three (3) locations of previous pipe blowout were observed. Pipe extending to tunnel shafts, as well as at the top of each tunnel shaft, were observed in poor condition. Many pipe supports were observed in poor condition. 2.1 Overview The General Edwards Memorial Bridge, L‐18‐ 015(4D7), (the Bridge) was built in 1934 and is a bascule bridge (also referred to as a drawbridge). The Bridge spans the Saugus River between the City of Lynn and the City of Revere. The south abutment of the Bridge is in the City of Revere and the north abutment is in the City of Lynn. The Bridge is part of Massachusetts State Route 1A and has been under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) since 2009, when it was transferred from Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) jurisdiction. Massachusetts State Route 1A North is named “the Lynnway” north of the General Edwards Bridge in Lynn, and “North Shore Road” south of the General Edwards Bridge in Revere. Massachusetts State Route 1A is a multi-lane Figure 3- Orthophoto of General Edwards Bridge arterial roadway and provides regional connection along the shoreline between East Boston/Revere to the south and Swampscott/Salem to the north. The Lynnway is under DCR jurisdiction and North Shore Road is under MassDOT jurisdiction. The Section 56 water main at the Saugus River crossing was built when the bridge was constructed. The pipe is mounted on the under- side of the bridge and is a 20” diameter flanged steel pipe with 1/2” wall thickness. The pipe is supported by the bridge structure in the spans approaching the bascule. In these spans, the Figure 4 - Typical Configuration of Pipe, Support Beams, pipe rests on radially cut I-beams welded to and Timber Plank Walkway 2-1 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY bridge support beams. There are no pipe rollers associated with this system, so the pipe can slide within each radially cut beam section. At the movable leaf of the bascule bridge, bends orient the water main to within the bridge towers, across bridge fenders, and into the tunnel system, as shown in Figure 5, Tunnel Plan 1934. 2.2 Pipeline Inspection The Section 56 water main on the General Edwards Bridge was inspected by Green International in December 2015 as part of the feasibility study. Access to the structure was gained by using an under-bridge inspection unit (a “snooper” truck) and ladders at the bridge ends. The MWRA inspection was performed December 14, 15, 16, and 23, 2015. Green International Affiliates performed a subsequent inspection as part of a MassDOT inspection contract on January 28 and 29, 2016. The remainder of report Section 2.2 is taken from the Green International Affiliates memorandum to Weston & Sampson titled “Water Main Condition Findings”, dated February 25, 2016. Green International Affiliates performed a hands‐on inspection of the entire exposed length of the existing water main, its supports and end connections throughout the bridge approach spans, the tower transition areas, and the water pipe tunnel entrance shafts. They compared available record plan information with what was found and measured in the field. Areas of deterioration were identified on a framing plan from the applicable record drawings, as attached in Appendix B. Figure 5 - Tunnel Plan 1934 At the time of the inspection, material samples were taken by the Green International Affiliates inspection team and an MWRA welding crew in the form of steel pipe coupons, insulation samples and bridge steel and pipe coatings. These samples, aside from the steel coupon, were taken to identify possible hazardous material content. Select photographs, sketches, and field notes from the pipeline inspection are Figure 6 – Typical Deteriorated Pipe Support and Support Beams 2-2 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY attached to this report in Appendix B. 2.2.1 Pipe in Bridge Approach Spans The water main pipe, supported by the bridge superstructure, was found to be in poor condition with three failure areas noted. There are numerous areas of damaged or removed insulation wrap in each span. The exposed steel pipe in these areas typically has rusted and pitted surfaces all around the pipe, as shown in Figure 7, Typical Exposed Pipe Condition. The typical pitted surfaces were up to 15% of the outer perimeter and up to 1/8” deep. There is a black protective tar coating (deteriorated) on the outside of the pipe. Figure 7 - Typical Exposed Pipe Condition Pipe blowout or rupture areas were found on the bridge in spans 8, 10, & 13. One rupture is shown in Figure 8, Pipe Blowout Area Span 10 with Coupon Cutout. Failure appeared to have been a result of the pipe splitting along a seam weld. There were several areas of exposed pipe where there was up to 0.25 inch deep pitting of the steel pipe over approximately 70% of the pipe perimeter. Similarly pitted areas were found at the pipe blowout/rupture locations and direct caliper measurements of 0.25 inch remaining steel thickness were taken. Figure 8 - Pipe Blowout Area Span 10 with Coupon Cutout The pipe has a series of 90-degree bends in spans 5 and 7 where the pipe turns to the west then turns into the bridge towers, as shown in Figure 9, Insulated Pipe at Bend. The insulation layer in these bend lengths of pipe was of a different material type than the main horsehair type insulation and was typically deteriorating. Figure 9 - Insulated Pipe at Bend and Twisted/Deteriorated Support Beams at Span 5 2-3 westonandsampson.com",

Both tower water main sections were found to be in satisfactory condition, as shown in Figure 10, South Tower Pipe Condition. 2.2.3 Pipe to Tunnel Shaft The pipe outside the south tower was found to have a replacement protective layer installed and the pipe was not visible for inspection. The north tower pipe was exposed and has a similar pitted condition as was found on the approach span exposed pipes, as Figure 10 - South Tower Pipe Condition shown in Figure 11, North Exposed Pipe Section to Tunnel Shaft. The tunnel shaft was inspected from the top of each shaft structure. The tunnel pipe was not inspected as part of the project. Within both tunnel shafts water was found pooling on top of the pipe and the surrounding concrete fill. The South Tunnel Shaft has an access opening cut from the concrete slab on top of the shaft, as shown in Figure 12, Inside South Tunnel Shaft. The measured top of the water surface was approximately 56” from the underside of the concrete cap slab with an average water depth of 40” to solid concrete fill. There was soft material at the east shaft with a maximum depth to solid concrete of 52” or 96” from the underside of the concrete cap to solid concrete. A sketch depicting these measurements is included in Appendix B. The North Tunnel Shaft manhole was opened but measurements were more difficult to obtain. The distance from the underside of the manhole frame to the solid concrete was found to be approximately 74” with an 8” average water depth. A maximum water depth in soft material was found to be 21”. Figure 11 – North Exposed Pipe Section to Tunnel Shaft Both pipe conditions were as expected inside the shaft area and were deteriorated similar to the other typical exposed pipe areas with 0.25” deep pitting.

        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 2.2.4 Supports and Support Beams The pipe supports and support beams were found to be in poor condition overall throughout the approach spans. Typically, when the pipe support was found to be excessively deteriorated, the correspon- ding support beam was also found to be excessively deteriorated. Four (4) specific locations in Spans 3, 5, 10, & 12 were found to have deteriorated to a point where no loads are recommended to be placed on the support beams. A total of seven (7) pipe stabilizer frames were installed in spans 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 per the 1935 design plans. Stabilizer frames were located at the pipe expansion joint flanges to maintain alignment at the joints. The stabilizer frames were positively Figure 13 - Tunnel Shaft Profile 1934 attached to the pipe itself (typically bolted to a flange) and secured to the bridge by way of welds to the adjacent girder web. All of the girder webs at the welded connections where cracked welds were found were bulged by the apparent pulling or pushing against the girder web from the stabilizer frame ends. Some of these cracked welds were found to have propagated into the girder webs in spans 5, 9, & 11, as shown in Figure 14, Cracked Girder Web Span 11. The cracked welds and girder webs were immediately brought to the attention of the MWRA and MassDOT by the project team. Subsequent inspection of the stabilizer to girder connections was performed on January 28 and 29, 2016, by Green International Affiliates through a separate contract with MassDOT. 2.2.5 Conclusions The water main in the bridge approach spans is in poor to serious condition with typical pitted surfaces 0.125 inch deep and up to 0.25 inch deep with three blowout areas.

        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 2.3 Analysis of Coatings & Insulation Inspection in December 2015 revealed pipe insulation and coatings which might contain asbestos and/or metals of concern. Under feasibility study Additional Services Task Order No. 2, Weston & Sampson collected samples of readily available deteriorated materials to test pipe coatings for asbestos and lead, pipe insulations for asbestos, and pipe support coatings for RCRA 8 metals. The intent of sampling was to inform ongoing operations and maintenance on the Section 56 water main, inform the water main replacement feasibility study so that program scope, cost, and permitting could be estimated more accurately, and to inform future water main replacement design scope of work. The remainder of Section 2.3 of this report includes excerpt from the Weston & Sampson Memorandum “Hazardous Building Materials Investigation Services”, finalized June 29, 2016, as attached to this report as Appendix C. 2.3.1 Asbestos Weston & Sampson performed the bulk sampling in the area according to methods outlined in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance document titled, \"Guidance for Controlling Asbestos- Containing Materials in Buildings\" (Document No. 560/5-85/024). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines an Asbestos-Containing Material as a material that contains greater than one percent (1%) asbestos. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection defines an Asbestos-Containing Material (“ACM”) as a material that contains greater than or equal to one percent (1%) asbestos. Asbestos in concentrations greater than or equal to one percent (1%) was detected in four (4) of the materials sampled by Weston & Sampson. The following insulations were identified as asbestos-containing materials during the investigation: • Tar paper and horsehair insulation, typical of most indoor and outdoor pipeline installation. The horsehair, while not asbestos containing itself, should be treated as part of an asbestos containing material because it is impractical to separate it from the asbestos containing tar paper. • Fibrous insulations, typically at joints, sometimes wrapped in tar paper The presence of asbestos on the property does not necessarily mean that the health of abutters or operators at the site are endangered. Asbestos fibers present a serious health hazard only when they become airborne after being released from the material in which they are bound. ACMs Figure 15 - Fibrous Insulation Sample are most likely to be disturbed during maintenance, repair, Location No 4 or renovation activities. Future pipeline rehabilitation or demolition work must address the proper handling and disposal of both the asbestos containing materials and metals (described further below) identified at the site. The generation of an asbestos abatement removal specification is recommended in order to identify acceptable means and methods of performing asbestos abatement under EPA and Massachusetts regulations. 2.3.2 Lead Lead screening of pipe coatings revealed that neither sample contained levels of lead greater than the EPA residential standard of 0.50% lead by weight. The results of the samples ranged from 0.011% lead by weight to 0.079% lead by weight. However, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration 2-6 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY (OSHA) Lead in Construction Standard 29 CFR 1926.62 considers any detectable level of lead to be a potential for exposure if dust is generated from disturbance of surfaces coated with paint containing lead. OSHA defines any detectable concentration of lead in paint as a potential lead exposure hazard to workers doing construction/demolition-type work on these surfaces as even small concentrations of lead can result in unacceptable employee exposures depending upon the method of removal and other workplace conditions. Since these conditions can vary greatly, the lead-in-construction standard was written to require exposure monitoring or the use of historical or objective data to ensure that employee exposures do not exceed the Action Level of 30 micrograms per cubic meter of air (μg/m3). The contractor must provide respiratory protection, protective work clothing and equipment, change areas, hand washing facilities, biological monitoring, and training until an exposure assessment has determined that the work activity will result in an exposure below the permissible exposure limit. Additional requirements under this standard include a written compliance program as well as record keeping. 2.3.3 Metals (RCRA-8) The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) monitors contaminants that are considered environmentally hazardous because they exhibit characteristics of corrosivity, toxicity, ignitability, or reactivity. Weston & Sampson performed metals testing of a pipe support coating for RCRA-8 metals that are commonly found in industrial coatings. “20 Time Rule” TCLP Analyte Result (mg/Kg) Analysis Threshold (mg/Kg) Arsenic ND 100 Barium 3,700 2,000 Cadmium 11 20 Chromium 1,200 100 Lead 180,000 100 Selenium 5.3 20 Silver ND 100 Mercury 1.1 4 Table 1 - RCRA-8 Metals Sample Results Barium, Chromium and Lead concentrations were greater than “20 times” their hazardous waste toxicity threshold (i.e. the 20-times rule). If pipe coatings are to be removed and disposed, Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) analyses should be performed to determine requirements. If the metal and coatings are removed as a whole component (metal with coatings still applied) and recycled, TCLP is not necessary, as bulk scrap metal items being recycled are not subject to MassDEP Hazardous Waste Regulations (310 CMR 30.202(5)f). Should any of the analytes fail TCLP analyses, the pipe support coating will be considered a hazardous waste and disposal will be governed by RCRA and MassDEP Hazardous Waste Regulations. The coating should be handled as a hazardous waste until further testing, using the TCLP analysis, confirms the waste’s toxicity characteristic results. Given that handling method impacts disposal requirements it is recommended that a project specific specification for removal and disposal of coatings containing metals be prepared to define acceptable means and methods for removal and disposal in accordance with EPA and Massachusetts regulations. Typically, metals in coatings present a health hazard only when disturbed during maintenance, repair, or renovation activities. The handling of these materials must be performed in accordance with the health 2-7 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY and safety measures outlined in OSHA regulations. Contractors should be informed prior to working when coatings containing metals exist on a work premise. Due to the presence of several of the metals in elevated concentrations, a contractor will likely be required to provide respiratory protection, protective work clothing and equipment, change areas, hand washing facilities, biological monitoring, and training until an exposure assessment has determined that the work activity will result in an exposure below the permissible exposure limit for any of the materials listed above.

        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.0 STUDY AREA The area around General Edwards Bridge has a rich and varied land use history and is subject to several ongoing development initiatives. The study area is also within various state and federal resource areas which will impact requirements of water main installation. This section of the report details the study area abutting the Section 56 crossing of the Saugus River at the General Edwards Bridge. 3.1 Site Features Site features and existing conditions will impact cost and feasibility of replacement alternatives at the Section 56 at the crossing of the Saugus River. Site features were identified in records review and field reconnaissance and compiled for presentation in the “Route Alternatives of Existing Conditions Plan”, attached in Appendix D. 3.1.1 General Edwards Bridge Condition An overview of the General Edwards Bridge was briefly described in Section 2.0 of this report. The Federal Highway Administration National Bridge Inventory (available online) indicates that the last inspection of the General Edwards Bridge was performed in June 2014 and that deck, superstructure, and substructure condition ratings were “5”, “5”, and “4”, respectively. A structurally deficient bridge is one for which the deck, superstructure, or substructure is rated 4 or less. This is based on a scale of 1 to 9, with a score of 9 being “excellent” and 0 being “imminent failure”. Therefore, the bridge is currently rated “structurally deficient”. The National Bridge Inventory identifies that the Bridge was last reconstructed in 1990, that the “Bridge is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places”, and that recommended work includes “Replacement of bridge or other structure because of substandard load carrying capacity or substandard bridge roadway geometry”. MassDOT has an open project number 608396, titled “Lynn-Revere Bridge Reconstruction”. Per an exchange between the MWRA and MassDOT in September 2016, a representative from MassDOT indicated that funds to design this project have not been secured, and that it is not likely to happen within the next 10 years. General Edwards Bridge replacement is a risk to the MWRA Section 56 water main in the existing bridge corridor. 3.1.2 Historic Wood Deck Bridge An existing wood deck bridge pre-dated the General Edwards Bridge and occupied a space immediately to the east of the exiting Bridge. Figure 17, Historic Bridge Alignment, indicates in a 1933 conceptual rendering the existing bridge immediately to the east of the proposed bridge. Similar to the General Edwards Bridge, this bridge had fenders extending laterally from the bridge alignment and likely rested on an extensive subsurface support system comprised of wooden piers.

The submarine cable is located immediately west of the Bridge in the north half of the river, then it shifts to the west of the historic railroad bridge around the middle of the river. Overhead transmission assets exist west of the submarine cable and cross the Saugus River on a diagonal. On land, electric transmission assets run north in an easement immediately behind premises west of the Lynnway. Historically, these electrical transmission Figure 19 - Historic Power Lines in Harbor Area assets crossed the Lynnway just north of the Bridge and occupied the harborfront parcels east of the General Edwards Bridge. The overhead power lines were relocated through a local, state, and private effort oriented towards taking Lynn Harbor back for beneficial use. Power line relocation from the shore was performed in 2010 with funding, in-part, by a state Massworks grant. The Lynn Harbor parcels cleared of powerlines have not been developed for alternative land use at the time of this study. 3.1.5 Lynn Fishing Pier The DCR owns and maintains a fishing pier to the east of the General Edwards Bridge referred to as Lynn Fishing Pier.

The date of construction and depth is unknown. The 1973 Fish Pier drawings indicate the wall is a timber bulkhead with horizontal tie rods to a deadman anchor wall 30-feet inland. The seawall is observed to be in poor condition, with the bulkhead washed out in many locations and evidence of resulting shoreline erosion. The Lynn Economic Development and Industrial Corporation (EDIC) indicates that there may be an effort in the future to replace a section of the seawall.

The landfill was capped in 1986 and no known alternative use of the space is ongoing. The municipal landfill resides about 150 feet from the Lynn seawall bulkhead. 3.1.11 Historic Industrial Land Use at the GE Gearworks Facility Parcels to the west of the Lynnway once comprised an industrial site owned by GE, named Gearworks. The 500,000 square foot plant was developed in 1941 and manufactured main propulsion gear boxes for destroyers, nuclear carriers, and submarines. The Gearworks plant was closed and demolished in 2011 and has remained vacant since that time. Development proposed at this property is described in Section 3.5.5. At this time, several utility-related buildings and tanks are scheduled to remain near the shoreline, and the remainder of the site is scheduled for mixed-use commercial/residential development. This site will be subject to extensive construction operations and change of use in the coming years as the development plan is executed. 3.2 Regulatory and Resource Areas The General Edwards Bridge is within a tidally influenced zone just prior to the confluence of the Saugus River and Lynn Harbor. Immediately upstream of the Bridge is the Rumney Marsh and the confluence of the Pines River and the Saugus River. The site is subject to various regulatory and resource restrictions that will impact construction operations and permit requirements. These resource areas were considered in identification of probable permits required of route alternatives. Boundaries of areas are identified in the “Route Alternatives Over Existing Conditions Plan”, attached in Appendix D, where applicable. 3-4 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 3.2.1 ACOE Navigation Channel The General Edwards Bridge area is tidally influenced and contains a US Army Corps of Engineers (“ACOE”) Federal Navigation Project (“FNP”). The Saugus River FNP has an “Authorized Project Depth” 8.0 feet below mean lower low water (MLLW) 1983-2001 Tidal Epoch. MLLW is 5.00 feet below mean sea level (MSL). The FNP through the project area is typically about 150-feet wide, though it narrows at the channel under the General Edwards Bridge. Per guidance for the Army Corps General Permit for Massachusetts “Subsurface utility lines must be installed at a sufficient depth to avoid damage from anchors, dredging, etc., and to prevent exposure from erosion and stream adjustment” and “as an absolute minimum, the bottom cover associated with the initial installation of utility lines under navigable waters and navigation channels shall be 48-inches in soil or 24-inches in rock excavation in competent rock unless specified in a written determination. These minimum bottom cover requirements for pipelines and cables shall be measured from the maximum depth of dredging Figure 26 - Excerpt NOAA Salem & Lynn Harbors to the top of the utility. The maximum depth of Map 13275 dredging, in waterways having existing Corps FNPs, is generally considered to be the authorized project depth plus any allowance for advanced maintenance and the allowable overdepth for dredging tolerances.” Sounding information from the US Army Corps last survey of the Saugus River channel (drawings dated 3/27/2008) suggests the actual depth at the center of the channel is typically 11 to 17 feet below MLLW. Given that actual channel depth, as of last sounding survey, is substantially deeper than the authorized project depth, it is likely that the actual river bottom depth plus water main cover requirements would satisfy the depth required of water main installation.

The DEP Wetlands Program delineates the Mouth of River as shown in Figure 33. This feasibility study did not include a complete environmental assessment nor delineation of resource areas. It is assumed a complete assessment and delineation will be performed in Preliminary Design prior to preparation of notices and permitting may be thoroughly informed. 3.3 Subsurface Conditions Weston & Sampson reviewed available “historical” records of subsurface conditions near the Project site. Most of the records were test boring logs provided to Weston & Sampson by the MWRA from their files. Weston & Sampson added logs of explorations conducted near the project area from previous Weston & Sampson projects in the area. The purpose of reviewing and presenting a discussion of historical exploration data was to provide the project team with a generalized understanding of subsurface conditions appropriate for a feasibility study. The information contained herein should not be interpreted as an engineering analysis of subsurface conditions for project design. 3.3.1 Historic Exploration Data The historical exploration data were collected at different times, by a variety of exploration contractors using different exploration equipment and methods. No engineering reports were available to describe how the data were collected. Weston & Sampson was not involved in collecting the majority of the information. Under these conditions, it is our opinion that placing strong emphasis on quantitative comparisons of these data sets is not appropriate and could be misleading. For example, “blow counts” shown on test borings logs may or may not represent standard penetration testing. Accordingly, we have purposely left out discussion of available blow count data from the explorations since we cannot verify that the information is indicative of SPT N-values. Another issue is lack of information on elevation datum on the logs, which suggests caution when comparing the test boring data in subsurface profiles. Nonetheless, the information is considered suitable for supporting a generalized qualitative discussion of subsurface conditions for this feasibility study. Based on initial review of the available exploration logs listed below, the project alignment can be divided into the North Bank Area (Lynn Side), the River Channel Area, and the South Bank Area (Revere Side). Explorations have been categorized according to the year drilled and the area they represent. A brief description of the explorations and sources of information are provided below. A figure indicating approximate locations of referenced borings, and the attached logs for more detailed information, are attached in Appendix E. 1934 Borings (River Channel Area) A total of 32 test borings labeled #1 through #32 were drilled for design of the existing General Edwards bridge pier foundations.

Refer to Appendix E for approximate locations of borings and the attached logs for more detailed information at specific locations. River Channel Area Based on the 1934 borings, the generalized soil profile of the River Channel Area from the mudline downward consists of approximately 5 to 20 ft. of silty SAND with varying organic content overlying approximately 30 ft. to 95 ft. of medium stiff to soft blue CLAY. The clay stratum is underlain by what appears to be dense GLACIAL TILL (sand, gravel and clay described on the logs as “hardpan”). The hardpan is typically identified in the bottom 3 ft. to 5 ft. of each boring. The upper silty SAND layer is typically 5 ft. to 10 ft. thick in borings #13 through #24 located in approximately the southern half of the river channel. The upper silty SAND was typically 5 ft. to 20 ft. thick in borings #1 through #12 located in approximately the northern half of the river channel with layer thicknesses generally increasing closer to the northern shore. Borings #1 through #5, which are near the northern shore, also encountered between approximately 2 ft. and 10 ft. of peat and organic silt underlying the upper silty SAND layer. The CLAY stratum appears to have an approximately 5 ft. to 10 ft. thick “medium blue clay” upper layer with the underlying material generally described as soft. The CLAY stratum thickness appears greatest in the northern half of the river channel with thicknesses ranging from approximately 85 ft. to 95 ft., whereas the clay thickness decreases from about 90 ft. near the center of the channel to approximately 30 ft. near the southern shore. The 1934 boring logs were presented in the form of a subsurface profile, which is attached to this memorandum. The 1973 borings encountered similar soil conditions as those encountered by the 1934 borings. However, 1973 borings B-1, B-2 and B-3 encountered between 3 ft. and 23 ft. of the upper sand layer, then penetrated into and were terminated in the clay layer between 30 ft. and 60 ft. below mudline. The 1973 boring B-4 encountered approximately 3. 5 ft. of silt and sand overlying stiff clay to about 20 ft. below grade, where the boring encountered very dense sand and gravel (GLACIAL TILL). The general stratum description on the log indicated boulders might be present in the GLACIAL TILL. This boring was terminated at 32 ft. below grade with refusal conditions encountered (100 blows of a 200 lb. hammer on an open end a-rod). North Bank Area Borings in the North Bank Area include the 1954 borings, the 1983 borings and the 2011 borings. The 1983 borings penetrated only 3.5 to 5 ft. below grade so are of limited value to the project. The 1954 borings were drilled in the Lynnway between Hanson Street and the approach ramp to the General Edwards Bridge to depths ranging from 22 ft. to 35 ft., and the 2011 borings were drilled on the Pride Kia property on the west side of the Lynnway across from Hanson Street. Thee data sets provide useful information for understanding the subsurface profile in the North Bank Area. 3-11 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Based on the 1954 and 2011 borings subsurface conditions in the North Bank Area generally consist of between approximately 10 ft. and 16 ft. of loose to medium dense SAND FILL with variable amounts of gravel, silt, cinders, ash and debris including brick fragments and miscellaneous trash. The FILL is also intermixed with and layered with ORGANIC SILT in some locations. The FILL generally overlies a naturally deposited loose to dense SAND containing varying amounts of gravel and silt to between 21 and 31 ft. bgs. Where the SAND is fully penetrated, the underlying stratum can generally be described as medium stiff to very soft CLAY with little silt and trace fine sand to the depths explored (between approximately 35 ft. and 47 ft. below grade). The CLAY consistency generally becomes softer with depth. South Bank Area Based on the 1970 Borings, the subsurface conditions in the South Bank Area consist of approximately 5 ft. to 10 ft. of SAND FILL at the ground surface. The FILL overlies variable thicknesses of naturally deposited loose to dense silty SAND. Where fully penetrated by the borings, the silty SAND extended to between approximately 25 ft. and 50 ft. below ground surface. Thin layers of Organic SILT and PEAT were noted on some of the logs near the bottom of the SAND FILL and within the native silty SAND layer. The silty SAND overlies stiff to soft silty CLAY where the silty SAND layer was fully penetrated by the borings. Where fully penetrated by the borings, the CLAY layer varied from less than 10 ft. thick to over 40 ft. thick and generally has a stiff consistency near the top of the layer, becoming softer with depth. Where the clay was fully penetrated, the underlying soils are generally medium dense to dense SILTY SAND with gravel and boulders (GLACIAL TILL). Test boring 29, which was drilled to approximately 125 ft. below grade, encountered approximately 30 ft. of organic SILT with shells from about 30 to 60 ft. below grade but did not encounter the CLAY layer and went directly into the dense GLACIAL TILL soils. The boring extended through the GLACIAL TILL to approximately 115 ft. below grade where two 5 ft. rock cores were obtained. The logs indicate the rock core recovery was only about 15 to 20 percent in the two core runs. No information was provided to indicate Rock Quality Designations. 3.4 Environmental Records Weston & Sampson obtained existing soil and groundwater data from the Project Area by reviewing available information from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) Reportable Release Database, which includes files detailing the extent of response actions conducted under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP), 310 CMR 40.0000, to address known releases of oil and hazardous materials to the environment. The review identified 14 releases within the Project area. The impacted media, contaminants of concern, completed remedial actions and regulatory status for each release are summarized in tables and figures attached in Appendix F. 3.4.1 Review of Existing MassDEP Records Review identified four reported releases on the Revere side of the Saugus River. In general, these releases were limited to small releases of petroleum products to soil and groundwater and the extent of contamination was relatively limited. While these releases achieved regulatory 3-12 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY closure under the MCP, some residual contamination in soil and groundwater exists; however, based on the data provided in historic reports, contamination is expected to be localized to areas where the releases occurred. A summary of the analytical sampling results and areas of contamination for releases on the Revere side of the Saugus River are provided in Appendix F. Our findings suggest impacted soil is present on the Lynn side of the Saugus River. Several environmental reports listed the Project Area in Lynn as an area filled with dredged sediment and municipal wastes between the 1920s and 1930s. These fill materials may extend up to 12 feet below grade and include coal, coal ash, brick, glass, wood and other debris. Based on our review of the historic reports, fill materials were identified at properties on the eastern and western sides of the Lynnway (see Figure 1 in Appendix F), including the following sites identified by address and release tracking number (RTN): • 671 Lynnway (RTN 3-15603) • 715 The Lynnway (RTN 3-13417) • 770 Lynnway (RTN 3-11033) • 777-793 Lynnway (RTN 3-4663 & 3-24567) • 715 The Lynnway (RTN 3-3329) • Harding Street LC7 (RTN 3-12511) Soil sampling indicates the fill contains concentrations of metals, semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). In addition to historic fill on the Lynn side of the Saugus River, Weston & Sampson notes there are four sites within the Project Area where non- fill related residual contamination may also exist, which has the potential to impact off-property areas. A summary of the conditions for these sites is provided below. A summary of the analytical sampling results and areas of contamination for the most significant reported releases on the Lynn side of the Saugus River are provided in Attachment B. 715 The Lynnway (3-13417) In addition to historic fill containing VOCs, SVOCs, metals and TPH, groundwater at this property was noted to contain concentrations of chlorinated VOCs, including1,2- dichloroethylene (1,2-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). VC concentrations were present at levels up to 2,000 micrograms per liter, well in excess of applicable MCP Method 1 GW-2 standards. Groundwater flow was also noted to flow south from the property towards our selected Project Area. Environmental records for this release noted that remediating the fill or contaminated groundwater was infeasible. To achieve regulatory closure, an Activity and Use Limitation (AUL) was placed on the property to restrict future excavation activities. Based on the existing data and nature of contamination documented at this site, there is the potential for this property to impact future utility construction, depending on the design and route. 3-13 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Mobil Gasoline Station, 700 Lynnway (3-4486) In 1992, faulty underground storage tank (UST) supply lines were identified to have released gasoline to soil and groundwater. The release of gasoline to groundwater resulted in a plume of gasoline constituents on the property. In situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) treatment was performed in 2005 and 2007 to address the dissolved phase groundwater plume; however, groundwater samples collected as recently as 2014 indicated elevated concentrations of volatile petroleum hydrocarbon (VPH) fractions at one location persist above applicable MCP Method 1 GW-2 standards. In 2015, the existing gas station was closed and three 10,000-gallon USTs and associated piping were removed. Following UST removal, impacted soils were excavated and approximately 1,008 tons of petroleum-impacted soils were transported for off-Site recycling. Approximately 32,000 gallons of dewatering fluids were also treated and discharged to the Lynn sewer system during the removal. Based on the site files for this release, the site is currently being evaluated for closure under the MCP but has not achieved regulatory closure. Based on the existing data, age of the release, and nature of contamination documented at this site, potential gasoline-impacted groundwater may have migrated off-Site and impacted down- gradient areas. As such, there is the potential for this release to impact future utility construction, depending on the design and route. 811 Lynnway (3-2326) In 1988, 60 cubic yards (CY) of oil-impacted soil was stockpiled on the Site. These soils were excavated during the removal of two leaking 275 gallon USTs. In 1991, these soils were prepared to be removed from the Site; however, there is no record of actual removal. Our review of the existing documentation suggests the 1988 removal of the leaking USTs may not have been in compliance with applicable MassDEP regulations. In addition, staging of petroleum impacted soils for an extended period of time may have results in impacts to soils and groundwater, which have not been evaluated. It is possible that petroleum impacts are still present at this property and could impact future utility construction depending on the final design route. 671 Lynnway (3-15603) Historic investigation of this site identified VOCs, SVOCs, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), metals, and TPH impacts in soil and groundwater. These contaminants were attributed to two sources of contamination: the historic fill prevalent in the area and historic releases of petroleum from historic aboveground and underground storage tanks. Petroleum impacts to soil and groundwater were discovered in the 1992 from the release of waste oil from an aboveground storage tank (AST) and in 1998 during the decommissioning of six USTs. Site file indicate the property also has a history as a railroad bed prior to 1880, which may be a contributing source of contamination to this site and surrounding area. An AUL was filed for the property in 2002 and requires the maintenance of asphalt barrier to prevent exposure to impacted soils/fill at this property.

In addition to metals, VOCs, SVOCs, PCBs and petroleum hydrocarbons, historic fill from the 1920 and 1930s was not analyzed for but may have included asbestos waste. Weston & Sampson also notes our review of existing soil and groundwater data is based on review of MassDEP records for sites where there have been known releases of oil and/or hazardous materials to environment. Given the proximity of the Project Area to industrial and commercial facilities, including the General Electric (GE) Aircraft Engines manufacturing plant and historic railroad operations, unknown sources of contamination may exist with the potential for additional sources of contamination, such as petroleum impacts and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are often associated with industrial/commercial and railroad activities. 3.4.3 Conclusions The information indicates historic fill is present on the Lynn side of the Saugus River. Fill is heterogeneous and historic analysis indicates it is impacted with VOCs, SVOCs, metals and TPH. The fill also included dredged sediment and municipal wastes which may have been contaminated when placed in the 1920 and 1930s. These historic fill materials were not identified on the Revere side of the Project area. In addition to historic fill, review identified potential soil and groundwater contamination from non-fill related sources, including several releases of petroleum on both the Lynn and Revere side of Saugus River and a release of chlorinated VOCs to groundwater in Lynn. Limited delineation for some of these reported releases indicates there is a potential for contamination in the Project area to impact future utility construction depending on design and location. 3.5 Stakeholders and Abutters 3.5.1 City of Lynn The northern limit of the Section 56 crossing of the Saugus River is in the City of Lynn. The City of Lynn owns local streets in the project area, including Hanson Street, a local street connecting the Lynnway to the Lynn Harbor shoreline northeast of the General Edwards Bridge. The City of Lynn considers the area east of the General Edwards Bridge (through the roundabout to Nahant) to be part of a strategic Lynn Municipal Harbor area in which they wish to promote bettered land use for the community. The interests of the City in in the area are summarized as follows (from September 2010 Municipal Harbor Plan by Sasaki): • “enhance the physical and visual connection of the larger City with its waterfront • create a unified series of public spaces along a waterfront promenade 3-15 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY • create a landmark open space within the waterfront for the staging community events and celebrations • create a mixed-use neighborhood designed to maximizes the benefits to be derived from its unique waterfront location (e.g., views and water/land interface) • ensure that the future development of the waterfront functions as an extension of, rather than a departure from, the City's existing urban fabric • configure and align development blocks so as to promote energy conservation though the siting of buildings • expand the range of transportation options available to residents through the introduction of a water-based option • coordinate the goals of the City to promote the beneficial development of its waterfront with the goals and policies of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to protect the interests of all Commonwealth citizens with regard to the use of public trust lands (i.e., tidelands)” Figure 34 - Lynn Harbor Planning Area from MHP The vision for land use was reconciled into a Lynn Municipal Harbor Plan (“MHP”) which was approved by the Commonwealth’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs in 2010. The limits of the MHP area is shown in Figure 34. The MHP provided an opportunity for local and state agencies to reconcile vision and streamline approvals and permitting required for desired land development, as summarized below (from September 2010 Municipal Harbor Plan by Sasaki): • “Enhance the responsiveness of Commonwealth agency actions to the city's land use goals and objectives, harbor conditions, and circumstances; • Ensure that tidelands licensing actions pursuant to the provisions of M.G.L.c. 91 on individual properties and projects are taken in the context of the city's objectives and goals for the development of the larger waterfront area; and • Establish development and design standards specifically tailored to respond to the conditions of Lynn Harbor and the city's objectives and goals as substitutes for the general, state-wide standards specified at 310 CMR 9.00.” The area to the east of the General Edwards Bridge is referred to as the “Gateway Zone”, as described below and conceptually rendered in Figure 35.

As the gateway to the City from points to the south, it is vital to the future of the City that the development of this area be of high aesthetic quality. To ensure that private interests will be able to derive sufficient financial returns to establish and maintain the desired quality, land uses must be of high inherent value and developed at relatively high densities. Accordingly, the Gateway Zone is envisioned to be a mixed- use neighborhood containing a variety of housing types, block configurations, and price ranges, with supporting retail, restaurants, and some office space. The majority of the office space would be located along the Lynnway, with residential buildings making up the rest of the district. Ground floor retail would be encouraged along the Lynnway, the waterfront, and other primary streets within this zone. Restaurants would be oriented towards the water to capitalize on views of the ocean, Nahant, and the Boston skyline. A typical block within this zone would have lower-rise residential building massing along the waterfront, transitioning to high-rise massing in the middle of the zone, so as to maximize waterfront views for each development. Structured parking would be internal to the block and could be created with a green roof or encouraged to support activities to lessen the heat island effect and create a more pleasing view for the residents. The \"water-dependent use zone\", as defined in the Massachusetts Waterways Regulations at 310 CMR 9.51(3)(c), within the Gateway Zone is to be reserved for such water-dependent uses as recreational marinas and a public pedestrian promenade. The marina envisioned for the mouth of the Saugus River is to incorporate the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation's existing public fishing pier, taking it out of isolation and enhancing its value to the public. The marina along the shore of the inner harbor will be created by excavating and removing part of the municipal landfill and re-establishing a watersheet in this area of filled tidelands. The pedestrian promenade along the harbor edge in the Gateway Zone is envisioned to be part of an expanded park space extending at least 200 feet inland from the water's edge.” Figure 35 - Conceptual Rendering Gateway Zone from MHP The MWRA and Weston & Sampson met with the Economic Development & Industrial Corporation of Lynn (“EDIC”) in September 2016 and the Lynn Water & Sewer Commission (“LWSC”) in October 2016 to discuss the Project and interests in the work area.

The project is described in a November 16, 2015 draft Environmental Notification Form (“ENF”) as follows: “The project is located on a ±77 acre parcel along the westerly side of the Lynnway (Route 1A) just north of the Saugus River. A 65.5 acre portion of the parcel was purchased by the Proponent for the development of a transit-oriented, residential development project with mixed-use accessory services. The remaining 11.5 acre portion of the parcel will be retained by GE and currently houses an outlying utility building and jet fuel storage tanks, utilized by the adjacent Riverworks plant. The site was previously part of Figure 39 - Lynn Gearworks Redevelopment Conceptual property owned by GE, along with Rendering October 2016 the adjacent Riverworks plant to the west, and at its peak in 1942 contained a 500,000 SF Navy gear plant with over 15,000 employees working in multiple shifts. Due to a decline in gear orders, GE sold its non-nuclear gear product line in 2009 and the Gearworks plant was closed and demolished in 2011. The proposed project is a transit-oriented residential development (TOD), which includes the construction of 1,250 residential units and a mix of ancillary retail, restaurant, and other supporting uses. In addition to the seven residential buildings, the project will include several supporting amenity buildings for use by the residents, including a 10,550 SF clubhouse, a 28,800 SF sports club, a 10,200 SF leasing / management office, and approximately 16,000 SF of complementary retail space to offer on-site service to the TOD residents, without requiring off-site trip making. Access to the site is currently provided via a signalized, full-access/egress driveway along the Lynnway (Route 1A) at the northerly end of the site, known as 19th Street. As part of the project, a secondary full-access/egress driveway is proposed at the southerly end of the site, connecting to the Lynnway (Route 1A) opposite the existing Jughandle, which will provide public access to the waterfront along Rumney Marsh and the Saugus River.” The final EIR was submitted in March 2017.

        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 4.0 RIVER CROSSING METHODS Open trench, mircotunneling and horizontal directional drilling (HDD) pipe installation methods were reviewed alongside removal and replacement on bridge. 4.1 Open Trench Marine pipeline installation across a navigable waterway via open trench dredging and pipe installation is typically conducted from barges. In typical installations, a trench is dredged to a depth sufficient for pipe installation and backfilling. The pipeline is lowered into place and the trench is typically backfilled with excavated soil. In some cases, a protective barrier such as a segmental concrete anchoring mat is placed over the backfilled pipe to reduce the risk of damage to the pipe by navigation operations. The depth and method of trench excavation is generally selected based on factors such as project size, characteristics of river bottom sediments and soils, range of water depth, and current. Softer or looser materials (generally associated with mild currents) tend to require greater excavation depths than stiffer or denser materials. The generalized soil profile of the Saugus River channel consists of several feet of organic (or marine) silty sand overlying up to 95 ft. of medium stiff to very soft blue clay. Glacial till and bedrock are present below the clay. The consistency of the clay is generally medium stiff near the top and becomes softer with depth. The materials to be dredged will depend on the final alignment and US Army Corps of Engineers depth of cover requirements. Hydraulic dredging and mechanical dredging/excavation are likely the most appropriate methods for this project. Use of a cofferdam is not viewed as practical at this site due to crossing-length, depth of channel, the navigable waterway, and tidal influence. Figure 43 shows an environmental clamshell bucket attached to an excavator supported on a platform barge in the foreground and a crane supported on a barge in the background. The excavator is suitable for relatively shallow excavation. A clamshell suspended from a crane can be used Figure 43 - Clamshell Bucket on Excavator where water depth and required excavation depth exceed the reach of a mechanical excavator. To ensure quality control during trenching, divers are typically employed with hydrographic scanners or sonar to verify trench depth and width. Trench spoil material can be stored on the river bottom adjacent to the trench if currents will allow this without undue sediment transport. Alternatively, trench spoils can be stored on the barge or transported to shore. Mechanical dredging can result in significant quantities of suspended sediments, which is particularly undesirable if there is a risk of environmental contamination along the pipeline alignment. 4-1 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Figure 44 - Hydraulic Dredge For softer bottom soil conditions and where sediment transport is a concern, methods such as hydraulic dredging can be used to limit sediment suspension and loss. The adjacent image illustrates a hydraulic dredging operation. Material to be dredged is essentially vacuumed from the channel bottom. There can be a tool or cutterhead at the intake end of the suction line to loosen the material to be dredged. The suction line then vacuums and transports the loosened material up to the barge for storage or upland Figure 45 - Barge disposal. Once the trench is excavated to the required depth, the pipeline is assembled and lowered into place from an installation barge as illustrated in the adjacent image. Pipe installed by this method can be High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Steel, Fiberglass Reinforced (FR), or Ductile Iron (DI) with flexible joints such as the Flex-Loc manufactured by American Cast Iron Pipe Company. Figure 46 - Floats Anchor collars can be added to the pipe to aid in installation and help control flotation and movement in the trench. Once the pipe is tested and placed in the trench, the trench is backfilled with the excavated material and/or imported gravel fill. Protective segmental concrete mats can be placed over all or part of the pipe for additional Figure 47 - Concrete Mats protection. 4.2 Microtunnel Microtunneling is a pipe jacking process that employs a remotely controlled, closed face tunneling shield, also commonly referred to as a Microtunnel Boring Machine (MTBM). Closed face earth pressure balanced or slurry pressure balanced shields are capable of exerting a positive pressure against the 4-2 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY excavation face to maintain face stability and prevent ground and groundwater inflow into the pipe during construction. Routine personnel entry of the pipe being jacked is not required for microtunneling. The pipe diameter range for microtunneling is generally from 10 to 136 inches, however the most common pipe diameter range for microtunneling is between 24 to 48 inches. The primary advantages of microtunneling are that the product pipe can be directly installed in a smaller ground opening and the depth of the tunnel can be adapted to the subsurface conditions. Direct installation of the product pipe by microtunneling tends to reduce the risk of loss of ground and surface settlement compared to horizontal directional drilling methods for similar sized pipe. If necessary, the vertical grade of the pipe can be lowered (deeper jacking and receiving shafts required) to avoid poor ground conditions identified along the alignment. Considerations for microtunneling pipe selection and cutter head design include soil type, strength, consistency, potential for encountering Figure 48 - Typical Microtunnel Operation obstructions and groundwater levels. Subsurface explorations along the microtunnel alignment and material laboratory testing are required to identify the design parameters. Portions of the river crossing alignments are expected to encounter soft clay soils, which can cause difficulty maintaining line and grade. The risks associated with controlling line and grade can be minimized by utilizing microtunneling equipment and pipe adaptable to the anticipated ground conditions. Utility installation using microtunneling can be executed as a one-pipe or two-pipe system. In a one- pipe system, the pipe installed via microtunneling is the final “product”, or “carrier”, pipe. In a two-pipe system, a “casing” pipe is installed via microtunnel, then a “carrier” or “product” pipe is sliplined into the casing pipe. Spacers are typically used to slipline the carrier pipe followed by backfilling the annulus space. A two-pipe system will likely to be required at this crossing. Staging Areas Staging areas are required at each end of the microtunnel reach: a jacking shaft at one end and a receiving shaft at the other end. The jacking shaft is of more substantial design consequence as this is where most of the work takes place. The adjacent image is a schematic illustration of a jacking shaft staging area. The staging area needs to be large enough to accommodate pipe delivery, storage and handling, a control cabin for guiding the MTBM, muck handling, temporary storage and disposal, shaft ventilation systems and other support equipment. The staging area configuration can be modified to accommodate available space and existing surface features and land use. The receiving shaft is generally smaller and sized to allow the tunneling shield to be lifted out by crane after tunneling is complete. 4-3 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY A typical jacking shaft staging area might require a space 18 to 24 ft. wide by 75 to 100 ft. long including space for a 10 to 15 ft. wide by 15 to 25 ft. long jacking shaft. Shaft depth is determined by a variety of factors including anticipated soil and groundwater conditions, installation length, depth of cover and other factors. The lateral limits of the jacking shaft are selected to accommodate a reaction wall for the retractable hydraulic jacks, the excavation support system for the sidewalls and floor of the shaft, and the equipment and personnel needed in the shaft during tunneling. Intermediate Jacking Stations Dependent on ground conditions, pipe diameter, type of equipment used and crew experience, microtunneling drive lengths up to about 1,500 feet are feasible without the need for intermediate jacking stations (IJS). An IJS is a fabricated steel cylinder fitted with hydraulic jacks, which is incorporated into a pipeline between two specially fabricated pipe segments (see adjacent image for a typical assembly). Its function is to provide additional thrust in order to overcome skin friction and distribute the jacking forces over the pipe. IJSs are utilized when jacking forces exceed the capacity of the main jacks, the maximum allowable stress on the pipe or thrust block reaction load in the jacking shaft. Upon completion of the microtunneling drive, the operational components of the IJS are removed by personnel entry thereby allowing pipe string closure. Microtunneling standards Figure 49 - Intermediate Jacking recommend a minimum casing ID size of 39 inches if an IJS is used for Station construction. Of note is that OSHA confined space entry requirements will need to be adhered to. The use of an IJS is assumed as risk mitigation measure in this feasibility study given the microtunnel installation length and the limited ground conditions information. 4.3 Horizontal Directional Drill HDD is a pipe installation method that involves drilling a guided borehole, referred to as the pilot hole, through the ground along a predetermined path from an entry point to an exit point. For larger pipes, a small diameter pilot hole is drilled, and then enlarged by one or more passes of a reamer to a diameter typically about 1.5 times the finished pipe diameter. Throughout the pilot hole, drilling, and reaming process soil cuttings are removed from the borehole and borehole stability is maintained by a continually circulated drilling fluid (typically bentonite slurry). A variety of pipe materials can be installed using HDD methods, including steel, HDPE and PVC pipe. The pipe is assembled by fusing/welding pipe sections to form a continuous pipe of a length sufficient to span the distance from the entry point to the exit point. The pipe integrity is tested and the pipe is pulled back through the borehole in one continuous operation, if practical, to limit the risk of the pipe becoming stuck during pullback. The pipe can be assembled in segments and welded/fused in the field during pull back, but at an elevated risk of the pipe becoming stuck in the borehole and/or increased pull time and damage to the pipe. The Figure 50 illustrates the sequence of HDD. 4-4 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Figure 50 - Typical HDD Operation An advantage of HDD is its steering capability. Gradual changes in horizontal and vertical alignment can be accommodated. The maximum radius of curvature is dependent on the diameter and material of the pipe. For steel pipe, the typical allowable maximum radius of curvature in feet is 100 times the diameter of pipe in inches. Multiple changes in alignment and shorter-radius changes increase the risk of the pipe becoming stuck during pullback and/or damage to the pipe during installation. However, if an obstruction is encountered during pilot hole construction, the drill head can be pulled back and guided around the obstacle during pilot hole drilling, provided the change in alignment will not adversely impact pipeline pullback. Portions of the river crossing alignments are expected to encounter soft clay soils, which could cause steering difficulties. The risk associated with steering can be mitigated during design, and by utilizing appropriate steering heads during construction. HDD systems are typically launched from the ground surface so no jacking or receiving shafts are required. Therefore, the setup time is shorter compared to that of a microtunneling operation. Excavated materials, or “cuttings”, are suspended in the circulated drilling slurry. Slurry laden with excavated soil is passed through centrifuge desanding units to separate soil from the slurry before re-circulation. In general, there is less excavated material to manage with HDD compared to other trenchless methods. 4-5 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Bore entry and exit distance from the river will be a function of available space and site constraints (seawall, piles). “Starter casings” are optional driven casings which can be installed at the HDD entry and exit locations to limit risk of hydrofracture, if cover or fluid loss are a concern, and provide advantage by isolating soils near the surface, if contamination is a concern. HDD pipe installation may include a single carrier/product pipe, or a two-pipe carrier/product pipe and casing pipe system. Either option can include addition of a starter casing. In a single pipe installation the carrier pipe is designed to provide strength sufficient to withstand pulling forces and abrasion incurred during installation. A two pipe system will include carrier pipe, casing pipe, spacers, and backfill material in the annular space. A two pipe system is substantially more expensive. Expense is a result of adding a second pipe, spacers, fill, and labor, but also as it upsizes all aspects of the HDD operations. A larger reamed hole requires larger equipment, greater volume drilling fluids, greater volume spoils for disposal, and greater risk of release of drilling fluids due to pressure required to maintain a larger bore diameter. Staging Areas Staging areas are required on both ends of the HDD reach. Space requirements for each staging area depend on the phase of the work being conducted and the size of the drill rig. During drilling of the pilot hole most activity occurs at the location of the drill rig. The rig size required for HDD drilling is based on the following criteria: Size of HDD rig Pipe Size Range Depth of Pipe Range Bore Length Range Mini-HDD 2 in. to 25 in. Less than 30 ft. Less than 600 ft. Midi-HDD 12 in. to 25 in. 30 ft. to 75 ft. 600 ft. to 900 ft. Maxi-HDD 26 in. to 60 in. 75 ft. to 200 ft. Up to 10,000 ft. Table 2 – Rig Size Based on HDD Characteristics Anticipated bore lengths for the potential HDD alignments discussed below range from about 1,600 ft. to over 3,000 ft. Based on anticipated bore lengths and associated depth of pipe cover, it appears likely that maxi-HDD rig is most appropriate for the project. The staging area at the bore entry would likely be approximately 150 ft. by 250 ft. while a much smaller staging would be required at the pilot hole exit location. During reaming operations, an approximately 25 ft. by 50 ft. staging area might be required at the exit location to allow tools to be changed and for access by a vac-truck used to recover drilling fluid that may discharge from the bore exit. The following images illustrate typical entry and exit staging areas for HDD operations. 4-6 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Figure 51 - Typical Bore Entry Staging Figure 52 - Typical Pipe Side Staging The required staging area during HDD pull-back operations is a long linear right-of-way large enough to allow make-up of the entire length of pipe to be pulled into the bore. The pull-back staging area is usually at the bore exit, but can be at either end of the alignment depending on space limitations. If pull-back is performed on the bore entry side of the drill operation, the drill rig will need to be relocated from the bore entry side to the bore exit side prior to pipe pullback. The staging area should be in the range of the total 4-7 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY pipe length plus approximately 100 feet with an approximately 25 foot wide right-of-way. It appears that there is ample room on the Lynn side of project for pull-back staging. There are also opportunities for pull-back staging on the Revere side of the alignments. There are certain geometric constraints that impact selection of entry and exit point locations and associated staging areas. Considerations for minimum and maximum bore entry and exit angles, minimum radius of curvature for the bore and minimum depth of cover must be considered when selecting the minimum distance between pilot hole entry and exit points and, in turn, minimum distance between staging areas. Typically the entry and exit angles should be in the range of 8 to 12 degrees such that the pipe does not require lifting above approximately 12 feet for entry into the bore. Typical allowable maximum radius of curvature (in feet) for steel pipe is 100 times the nominal pipe diameter (in inches). Inadvertent Return of Drilling Fluids to the Environment Inadvertent return of drilling fluids to the environment is a risk of trenchless installation methods which use drilling fluids. Inadvertent return of drilling fluid to the environment may be characterized as a “frac out” or a “hydrofracture”. “Frac out” refers to an event where drilling fluid is released during drilling through a preferential seepage path along piers, piles, loose gravel, rocks or improperly backfilled test borings. “Hydrofracture” refers to an event where drilling fluid pressure overcomes the overburden pressure to release into the environment. Risk of release can be mitigated through appropriate subsurface exploration, design requirements, and construction methods. Subsurface investigations should be performed to identify a detailed soil bottom profile and characterize the physical properties of soils above and near the drill path. The design cover depth specified should be appropriate for anticipated drilling fluid pressure and subsurface conditions. An example depth of cover for this crossing might be around 30-feet. Requiring a starter casing at entry and exit locations can reduce risks of release in the shallowest portion of the HDD pipe installation. Drilling fluids will be designed based on the soil characteristics indicated in subsurface explorations. The contractor should have a contingency plan and be prepared to mitigate risk in the event of a release. Mitigating risk would include monitoring drilling fluids and adjusting chemical makeup and drill advancement rate. Monitoring can assist in identifying and remedying events where soil cuttings are not being conveyed sufficiently and fluid pressure is building-up. The contractor’s contingency plan should include adequate response training for staff and maintaining materials, equipment, and resources required to respond to a release event. 4.4 Replace On Bridge The General Edwards Bridge was designed and built in 1934. The water main suspended from the bridge is a 20” diameter steel pipe with a 1/2” wall thickness. Water main changes to 30” diameter steel in the bridge support towers and the tunnel shafts (navigation channel crossing). The water main was installed as part of the original bridge construction. The pipe is supported by the bridge structure in the approach spans, travels through the west side towers at piers 5 and 6, then crosses the fender system to the pipe tunnel shaft entrances. The water main/pipe is directly supported by a radius cut beam section which sits on top of the original bridge pipe support beams. There are no pipe rollers installed on the structure, so the pipe slides along the radially cut beam section. The pipe was originally designed to expand and contract at the designated pipe expansion joints each with associated stabilizer anchor frames fixed to the pipe and to the girder webs. 4-8 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY In December 2015, Green International Affiliates performed a visual inspection of the exposed length of the existing pipe, supports and end connections throughout the bridge approach spans, tower transition areas, and pipe tunnel entrance shafts. This inspection results were summarized in a memorandum “Task 2.1.2, Water Main Condition Findings,” prepared by Green International Affiliates and dated February 25, 2016. The conclusion of field reconnaissance was that the water main in the bridge approach spans is in poor to serious condition with pitted surfaces and evidence of three historic pipe ruptures. Laboratory analysis on pipe and bridge support coatings and insulation revealed heavy metals and asbestos, as detailed in the memorandum “Hazardous Building Materials Investigation Services” dated June 29, 2016. The tunnel shaft exposed pipe areas were identified in poor condition. Pipe supports and support beams through the approach spans were found to be in poor condition. During inspection cracks at the welded connection of the expansion joint stabilizer supports and girder webs were identified in spans 5, 9, and 11. These deficiencies were reported to MassDOT. Since it seemed the Section 56 water main stabilizer supports were compromising the integrity of the bridge girders, MassDOT requested the MWRA to perform an analysis of the pipe support system in order to cut the fixed stabilizer supports and pipe to eliminate longitudinal forces on the bridge girders, while ensuring a stable pipe support system would remain in place. The subsequent inspection included the in-depth hands-on inspection of the previously identified welds of the longitudinal frames to the girder webs, as well as the identification of any other welds associated with the support or stabilization of the MWRA ’s water main. Review of scope required to satisfy MassDOT’s concern over longitudinal forces apparently imparted by the water main system on the bridge girders is not included in this study. Removal and replacement of pipe on the bridge would include cutting and removing the existing water main above river level and replacement with a new steel or ductile iron water main essentially in the same location. Water main in tunnels and tunnel shafts have not been inspected. Per discussion with the MWRA, similar tunnel shafts have been observed in poor condition. The tunnel and tunnel shafts could be rehabilitated with a structural liner or replaced. For a comprehensive long-lasting solution, Weston & Sampson presents replacing the existing tunnel shaft with a new 180-foot tunnel shaft installed via microtunneling. On the bridge, pipe support beams would need to be removed and replaced where conditions require (34 deteriorated supports identified out of 117 total supports). A substitute for the fixed stabilizer frames (7 identified - attached adjacent to the pipe expansion joints) would need to be configured to secure the main but allow for expansion and contraction. It is possible the owner of the bridge, MassDOT, would require complete bridge structural analysis to determine the impact of the proposed water main replacement on the existing bridge. If the MWRA wished to upsize the water main then structural analysis would almost certainly be required. Removal and replacement of pipe on the bridge will require handling and disposal of existing pipe insulation which contains asbestos, and handling and disposal of existing pipe coatings which contain asbestos and heavy metals. Asbestos abatement must be performed in accordance with EPA and Massachusetts regulations. A Massachusetts licensed asbestos abatement contractor will be required to remove asbestos containing materials scheduled for removal. As the new pipe will likely be required to occupy a similar corridor as the existing pipe, asbestos containing materials need to be removed before new pipe installation proceeds. The handling and disposal of materials containing heavy metals must be performed in accordance with the health and safety measures outlined in OSHA regulations. The possibility of future replacement of the General Edwards Bridge should be weighed in the decision over whether to mount a replacement pipe on the bridge. The Federal Highway Administration National Bridge Inventory database indicates that the last inspection of the General Edwards Bridge was performed in June 2014 (presumably secured by the Owner, MassDOT) and deck, superstructure, and 4-9 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY substructure condition ratings were “5”, “5”, and “4” respectively. A structurally deficient bridge is one for which the deck, superstructure, or substructure is rated 4 or less, on a scale of 1-9 (9 being “excellent” and zero being “imminent failure”). In addition to condition deficiencies, another driver of bridge replacement might be local interest for aesthetic betterments. The General Edwards Bridge area is considered the gateway to the Lynn Municipal Harbor area, where an expansive plan for high-end residential, commercial, and marina development is underway. If the bridge was replaced, a replacement bridge might be constructed in the space immediately east of the bridge, where a bridge existed prior to the 1934 construction of the General Edwards Bridge. Bridge replacement would require replacement of the water main again, at least within the limits of the bridge superstructure. 4.5 Typical Profile for River Crossing Methods Depth of utility installation for each river crossing method would be determined in design. For a general comparison between methods, a typical profile rendering has been prepared and is attached in Appendix H.

Installation methods including open trench river crossing, horizontal directional drilling, microtunneling, and removal and replacement on the bridge were considered. Section 6 generally describes each pipe installation route alternative identified. 5.1 Overview Eight (8) route alternatives were identified and characterized. Full sized plans showing all-routes over an existing conditions plan, and all-routes over an orthophoto, are attached in Appendix D. A reduced depiction of all-routes over orthophoto is shown in Figure 53 on the following page. River crossing routes alternatives can be grouped in one of four geographic areas relative to the General Edwards Bridge: • East of the Bridge (Route 1, Route 2, Route 3, Route 7): This area provided accessible paths for open trench and microtunneling pipe installation at a modest distance from the bridge. Space constraints between the shore and a proposed development required HDD to be shifted farther east to find adequate space for staging areas and pipe string construction. River crossings to the far east required longer river crossing and on-land pipe installation. • Abutting the Bridge (Route 4, Route 5): Included routes immediately adjacent to the existing bridge corridor. This area provided for more direct route alignments, but passed through the layout of existing and historic structures in the area. • West of Bridge (Route 6): This area required long trenchless pipe installation lengths and substantial over land pipe installation. Pipe installation via horizontal direction drill most appropriate for this area due to long river crossing lengths. • On Bridge (Route 8): Installed under the bridge and in a tunnel, in an alignment approximately congruous that of the existing water main. Land acquisition and easement requirements were estimated for each alternative. In this section, estimated easements are identified for each route by Parcel ID, Owner, Location, and Easement Type. “Temporary” easements are those required for the construction duration only. “Permanent” easements are those required for long-term pipeline occupation of a space. The MWRA may choose to purchase land instead of securing permanent easements. Appendix K has a detailed tabulation of land acquisition and easements with more details including assessed values for buildings, features, and land. Property value and perceived depreciation value were relevant factors in Weston & Sampson’s estimation of probable cost of land acquisition. Permits required for each alternative are described herein. A detailed tabulation of permits for all alternatives is presented in the Permit Matrix attached in Appendix J.

        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Figure 53 – Routes over Orthophoto 5.2 Route 1A –Open Trench A prospective route for open trench pipe installation is shown in Appendix I Figure 3A. The prospective route for open trench pipe installation is the same as that proposed for microtunneling (shown on Appendix I Figure 3B). The trench alignment does not necessarily need to be a straight line. The horizontal alignment can be adjusted to avoid existing features. The degree of adjustment is dependent on the flexibility of the pipe. The open trench pipe installation route shown on Figure 3A is approximately 1,250-feet long and extends from shore adjacent to Rice Avenue, in Revere, to parcels east of the Lynnway in Lynn. Over-land cut & cover pipe installation would be required in Lynn (private parcels) and Revere (Rice Avenue) to connect the river crossing pipe to the existing MWRA Section 56 water main in the Lynnway. Uncertainties include dredged sediment contamination and related impacts to costs and environmental permitting, as well as tidal currents across the proposed alignment. The alignment could be moved further east if currents become an issue. The length of the crossing would be greater but risks of sediment disturbance may be less. 5-2 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Dredging activities and pipe assembly and placement are typically completed from barges on the river. There will need to be an on-shore staging area to store pipe and anchorage materials, equipment used on the barges, and possibly for dredged material storage and handling. The proposed route passes through parcels owned by the Point of Pines Yacht Club and WMI Lynn LLC (Joseph O’Donnell). Rice Avenue in Revere is a publicly accepted way. The barges are fitted with anchor piles that can be lowered into the river bottom to maintain a stable work position. Barges are maneuvered by tug boats. The pipe installation barge is usually equipped with a ramp or slide that guides the pipe and prevents excessive deflection of joints or bending during installation. As the barge is advanced, the pipe slides down the ramp and into the trench in a controlled manner. Pipe assembly either by welding steel, fusing HDPE or making up the Ductile Iron joints is accomplished on the pipe barge ahead of the ramp. The pipe barge(s) are generally long enough to allow for several joints to be made during deployment of assembled sections so the operation is more-or-less continuous. If there is room available on-shore, the full length of pipe can be assembled on one bank and pulled into position in the trench using a combination of tugboat, barge, divers, and winching from the opposite shore. Weighted collars can be added to the pipe as installation progresses.

        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 6.0 SCREENING AND RANKING Route Alternatives were screened and ranked to provide a basis of comparative evaluation. Finished pipeline performance and risk criteria were evaluated to yield a composite rating score for each alternative. A summary of ratings earned by each route alternative, as well as a detailed tabulation of observations and facts contributing to the rating, is presented in Appendix L. Conceptual cost and schedule were estimated for each alternative, as presented in Appendix M and Appendix N. The ranking score, conceptual cost, and conceptual schedule together provide a basis for comparative evaluation of route alternatives. 6.1 Composite Ranking Each route alternative was evaluated with respect to finished pipeline (as-built) performance and various implementation-related risk factors. The screening criteria were established to capture the relative advantage or risk of each route-alternative. Each criterion was assigned a score one to five, with scores applied as follows: 1 - Very Low Risk / Strong Advantage 2 - Low Risk / Advantage 3 - Medium Risk / Neither an advantage or a disadvantage 4 - High Risk / Disadvantage 5 - Very High Risk / Strong Disadvantage The sum of ratings applied to Pipeline Performance and Program Risks criteria established the composite, or total, rating. Criteria did not always include alternatives rated with a score of one or five. This was the case where the difference in advantageousness or risk was more appropriately weighted with a narrower rating spread. The lowest composite rating was ranked the highest from a technical advantageousness perspective. Appendix L includes a summary of ratings applied for performance and risk criteria and a tabular detail of the observations and facts contributing to the rating score applied. The narratives that follow describe the evaluation criteria and the factors that contributed to high and low rankings applied. 6.1.1 Pipeline Performance Pipeline performance criteria included Access for Maintenance, Protection Against Damage, and Hydraulics. These criteria captured the relative advantage or disadvantage of the finished solution after the system was successfully installed and in-operation. Useful service life was not evaluated as each installation option can provide for a pipeline useful life significantly greater than 50 years, with failure more likely a function of material specification and factors outside of MWRA control than route alternative and installation method. Access For Maintenance “Access For Maintenance” captured the advantage in accessibility of the finished pipeline for operations and maintenance activities. The lowest rating (1-strongest advantage) was applied where installed pipe was generally accessible through paved public ways by the MWRA with equipment and labor maintained in-house. The highest rating (5-strong disadvantage) was applied where the river crossing pipe and on-land pipe posed accessibility issues. 6-1 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Protection Against Damage “Protection Against Damage” captured the risk of damage from outside forces due to pipe location or configuration. The lowest rating (2-low risk) was applied where the pipe was confidently protected from known risks that might be incurred by aging infrastructure, environmental factors, and human influences. The highest rating (5-very high risk) was applied where pipe was most exposed to risk by aging infrastructure, environmental factors, and human influences. Hydraulics “Hydraulics” captured the advantage in finished pipeline hydraulics. The lowest rating (3-neither an advantage or disadvantage) was applied where the alternative provided for pipe sizing at the discretion of the MWRA and a variety of advantageous pipe materials. The highest rating (5- strong disadvantage) was applied where the alterative would likely limit pipe size and/or material due to requirements of the method or location. 6.1.2 Program Risks Program Risks included Permitting Approval Difficulty, Technical Complexity, Construction Risk, Environmental Risk, Impact on Abutters & Motorists, Easements & Land Acquisition, and MassDOT/DCR Support. These criteria captured the relative risk associated with implementing a route alternative. Permitting Approval Difficulty “Permitting Approval Difficulty” captured the relative rigor associated with permitting other alternatives. The lowest rating (2-advantage) was applied where typical permits required of construction in this low elevation coastal project area were required. The highest rating (5-strong disadvantage) was applied where the most rigorous and risky permitting obligations were required of an alternative, especially where the permits would include risk of denial or overly burdensome requirements due to disadvantageous environmental risk compared to alternatives or other factors (ie MEPA EIR). Permits estimated to be required for each route are listed in Appendix J, Permit Matrix. Technical Complexity “Technical Complexity” captured the relative planning and engineering rigor required to responsibly engineer and execute the proposed scope. “Scope Complexity” considered factors related to scale of scope, facets of scope, scope alignment with geologic and site conditions, and coordination of work (among others). “Potential Conflicts” considered existing and historic structures that would require accommodation and drive complexity in engineering design and construction coordination. The lowest rating (3-neither an advantage or a disadvantage) was applied where the team observed moderate technical complexity compared to other alternatives. The highest rating (5-strong disadvantage) was applied where the team observed most rigorous technical complexity compared to other alternatives. Construction Risk “Construction Risk” captured the estimated risk that will remain in the construction phase with typical risk mitigation applied in design and construction. Construction risk can result from factors relevant to other criteria, such as Technical Complexity, Environmental Risk, and Impact on Abutters & Stakeholders. The lowest rating (3-medium risk) was applied where the team 6-2 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY observed moderate construction risk. The highest rating (5-very high risk) was applied where the team observed very high construction risk. Environmental Risk “Environmental Risk” captured the estimated risk to the environment by a proposed alternative. Receptors considered included habitats, water quality, and species of concern. Risk associated with remediation of hazardous/contaminated materials encountered also considered. The lowest rating (2-low risk) was applied where the team observed relatively low environmental risk. The highest rating (5-very high risk) was applied where the team observed very high environmental risk. Impact on Abutters and Motorists “Impact on Abutters and Motorists” captured the scope and scale of impact due to construction operations on abutters and motorists. Noise, aesthetics, reduction in service in roadways, and detours were considered. These impacts were considered with respect to duration, breadth of impact, and sensitivity of impacted interests. The lowest rating (2-advantage) was applied where the team observed modest impact to abutters and motorists compared to other alternatives. The highest rating (5-strong disadvantage) was applied where the team observed significant impact to abutters and motorists compared to other alternatives. Easements & Land Acquisition “Easements & Land Acquisition” captured the rigor associated with land acquisition and easements compared to alternatives. The lowest rating (1-strong advantage) was applied where minimal expense, complexity, and risk is estimated associated with new land acquisition and easements. The highest rating (5-strong disadvantage) was applied where significant expense, complexity, and risk is estimated associated with new land acquisition and easements. MassDOT/DCR Support “MassDOT/DCR Support” captured how well an alternative aligned with the apparent interests of MassDOT and DCR. Interests of each organization included maintenance of service within roadways of their jurisdiction, and limiting risk incurred by the Project on their future operation, maintenance and/or replacement. The lowest rating (2-advantage) was applied where an alternative was estimated to be viewed favorably by MassDOT and DCR. The highest rating (4- disadvantage) was applied where an alternative was estimated to be viewed unfavorably by MassDOT and DCR. 6.2 Probable Cost Screening-level cost estimates were prepared to allow for comparison of probable cost among route alternatives. The team sought consistency in approach and accuracy appropriate for the application. The approach included itemizing work in a manner that was readily estimated by the project team, measuring quantities, and applying engineering judgement, by qualified team members, to estimate unit and lump sum prices. Conceptual cost estimates for each alternative were prepared and submitted in June 2016, then subsequently revised. Screening-level cost estimates and assumptions are presented in Appendix M. 6-3 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Expense categories included in screening cost estimates included Engineering, Land Acquisition and Easements, Construction, and Contingency: • Engineering expense included contract professional services furnished for engineering design, bidding, permitting, land acquisition, construction administration, and resident representation. Engineering design, bidding, construction administration, and resident representation services were estimated by identifying a typical labor rate and monthly labor utilization, then extending monthly resources expenditure to task duration, as indicated in Section 6.3. This approach was then then checked versus typical expense ratios for engineering services compared to construction cost. Permitting and Land Acquisition/Easement expense was separately estimated based on detailed study by-route, described in Section 5 and the Appendices. The average ratio engineering to construction expense was 27%. • Land Acquisition and Easements value was estimated as described in Section 5.1, and as detailed in Appendix K. Land acquisition and easements was estimated on a case-by-case basis, and was not assigned as a percent of construction cost. • Construction scope was itemized into substantive work scopes, measured, and estimated by qualified members of the project team based on professional judgement and project experience. Detailed backup for unit prices was not prepared for screening-level cost estimates. Work itemization included river crossing scopes (fixed and per foot), over land pipe installation (per foot), appurtenances, surface restoration, hauling and disposal of surplus excavated material, mobilization and incidentals, and uniformed officers for traffic control. Estimates accounted for markup and overhead associated with a general contractor managing specialty scopes performed by a subcontractor. At the time of screening-level cost estimation, costs were modeled assuming 24-inch diameter water main would be installed in the project area. • Contingency was included in the sum of twenty five percent (25%) of estimated construction, engineering, and land acquisition expense, per the MWRA’s recommendations for feasibility study cost estimation. The Engineering News Record (“ENR”) 20 Cities Construction Cost Index (“CCI”) value for June 2016 is 10,337. The ENR Boston CCI for June 2016 is 13,159. Conceptual costs were escalated to an ENR 20 Cities CCI index value approximately 11,000. 6.3 Schedule Screening-level schedule estimates were prepared to allow for comparison of probable schedule duration among route alternatives. The team sought consistency in approach and accuracy appropriate for the application. Conceptual schedule estimates for each alternative were prepared in June 2016, then subsequently revised. Complete itemized schedules for each route alternative are attached in Appendix N. Schedule tasks included Procurement of a Consultant, Preliminary Design, Final Design, Permitting, Bid Ready Documents, Land Acquisition and Easements, Bidding and Award, and Construction. • Procurement of a Consultant will result in securing contract engineering services from a consultant. The task is estimated to require about 6-months for all alternatives. MWRA notes that an additional 3-months may be required, for a total of 9-months. The extended period is represented in detailed review of schedule for the recommended alternatives in Section 7 of this report. 6-4 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY • Preliminary Design was typically estimated about 8-months, and will include survey, subsurface exploration, base map development, and a preliminary design report. Duration for MWRA review and comment was included. Preliminary design is the first phase of contract engineering services. • Final Design includes iterative submittal of advancing drawings and contract documents and MWRA review. 8-months was typically estimated for final design. Final design follows preliminary design. • Permitting duration was estimated for each alternative based on permits identified for each route alternative in Section 5 of this report. The Permitting period was estimated to begin midway through Final Design as initial contract documents provided sufficient information to begin some permitting obligations. The net duration of Permitting was typically driven by long duration permits which require Final Design provisions incorporated. • Bid Ready Documents follows Final Design and will incorporate revisions per permit, land acquisition, and stakeholder requirements. Bid Ready Documents concluded after conclusion of Permitting and Land Acquisition and Easements tasks. • Land Acquisition and Easements involves negotiation of easements with project area land owners. Abutters should also be canvassed during this period. Land Acquisition and Easements should begin as soon as practical, and are modeled to start concurrent with Preliminary Design. • Bidding and Award is estimated to require 6 months. This task will follow completion of Bid Ready Documents, and result in a secured construction contractor. • Construction involves implementation of water main installation and is the final phase of the project. Task duration was estimated as the sum of associated activities, including mobilization, river crossing pipe installation, over land pipe installation, connections to the existing system, water main testing and disinfection, surface restoration, and demobilization. The duration of active construction operations varied from 9 to 11 months depending on alternative. Mobilization was typically allowed an additional 3-months. 6-5 westonandsampson.com",

The open trench river crossing alternative was comparable in cost to HDD options, but included greater environmental risk, greater permitting difficulty, and a longer schedule duration. The alternative for pipe replacement on the bridge scored less favorably due to reduced protection against damage, hydraulic limitations, greater technical complexity, and greater construction risk. Relocation of Section 56 to a dedicated corridor will provide protection from weather exposure above grade and eliminate reliance on aging MassDOT bridge infrastructure. Based on composite ranking, cost, and schedule, HDD Route 3 and Route 7 are the top ranked alternatives. Each route shares drill entry at Hanson Street in Lynn. The routes have different drill exit locations, with Route 3 exiting near the end of the Point of Pines on Rice Avenue, and Route 7 exiting near the Point of Pines Yacht Club off Rice Avenue. An overview of differentiating factors among routes Route 3 and Route 7 is as follows: • Route 3 –Requires greater over-land pipe installation to connect to the existing main (2,900 feet) and is a relatively longer river-crossing route (2,500 feet). These factors contribute to it being the higher cost option. The location of crossing is at the broadest point in the river mouth which will reduce opportunity for scour of overlying earth by tidal and river flows over time. Risk of unknown historic piles along Route 3 is viewed as lower than along Route 7 since it is less likely that historic pile supported structures are present along Route 3 compared to Route 7. However, additional permitting may be required for Route 3 to due to habitat for a threatened bird species. This route may impact residential abutters in the Point of Pines area more significantly due to longer overland pipe installation and bore exit pit located squarely in Rice Avenue. Easements will be required with Point of Pines Beach Association, The City of Revere, WMI Lynn LLC, and Massachusetts Electric Company. Pipe string construction will require agreement with 6-6 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Massachusetts Electric Company (NGrid) to occupy the entire length of their parcel during pipe string construction. • Route 7 – Requires less over-land pipe installation to connect to the existing main (1,700 feet) but a slightly longer river-crossing route (2,700 feet). The combined impact results in Route 7 being considered slightly less costly than Route 3. However, Route 7 is perceived to have higher technical complexity and greater construction and post-construction risk because the alignment is subparallel to and therefore crosses a greater length of the Lynn seawall. This means there is greater risk of conflict between the HDD bore and the piles supporting the wall and wall anchorage system as compared to Route 3. There is also a risk of conflicts between the pipe bore and former electrical transmission tower foundations. Final design studies may determine that this risk is less than currently perceived depending on what information can be determined regarding the tip elevations of the existing piles. There is also a greater possibility of future risk to the pipeline if the seawall is repaired or replace, or if pile-supported marine structures are built extending out from the seawall in the future (i.e. new piles would be driven in proximity to the installed pipe). Route 7 has slightly less risk from a permitting perspective as it avoids construction near Revere’s barrier beach listed as a habitat for a threatened bird species. Easements will be required from the Point of Pines Yacht Club, The City of Revere, WMI Lynn LLC, and Massachusetts Electric Company. Pipe string construction will require agreement with Massachusetts Electric Company (NGrid) to occupy the entire length of their parcel during pipe string construction.

Based on composite ranking, cost, and schedule, HDD Route 3 and Route 7 are the top ranked alternatives. Route 3 river crossing is approximately 2,500-feet long, with 2,900-feet of over- land pipe installation. Route 7 river crossing is approximately 2,700-feet long, with 1,700-feet of over- land pipe installation. Both routes connect to the Section 56 water main in the City of Revere on the Lynnway near the ramp onto State Route 1A North, and in the City of Lynn on the Lynnway opposite Hanson Street. Conceptual plans for both routes, and expanded detail related to work limits at staging areas, are attached as Appendix O. Conceptual profiles for both routes are attached as Appendix P. The Lynn Harbor area has abundant space for horizontal directional drill staging and pipe sting construction. Staging area in Revere is much more limited. Therefore, each Route 3 and Route 7 propose drill entry staging from a location near the end of Hanson Street in Lynn. At the time of this report, it is understood that these parcels are not scheduled for development, and appear good candidates to secure temporary easements and permanent easements. Therefore, it is proposed that the two operations requiring the largest land area, pipe string construction and drill entry staging, each be performed from Lynn. As the pipe string is always pulled from the end of the hole back to the rig, staging each pipe string construction and drill entry in Lynn will require either 1) that the drill rig be relocated from Lynn to Revere to pull the pipe string after reaming, or 2) that the HDD contractor set-up a second rig at the drill exit to pull pipe. Operations in the drill entry staging area will require a minimum 3- to 4- months construction activity. Pipe sting construction in Lynn will require construction of a substantial pipe sting on a National Grid property north of Hanson Street. Operations on the site will ideally be performed from on, or immediately abutting, the Riley Way access road, to limit impact to the capped landfill inland. Cranes may be required to suspend and orient the pipe sting during the 1-day operation when the pipe is pulled into the bore hole. HDD operations can be performed from the Lynn staging area without blocking Hanson Street or the private access road, Riley Way. Typical HDD staging equipment and configuration are depicted in Figures 51 and 52 of Section 4.3. Route 3 and Route 7 differ in locations of drill exit in the City of Revere and in the angle that the alignments cross the Lynn seawall. Route 3 drill exit is near the end of Point of Pines peninsula on Rice Avenue. Route 7 drill exit is in the general vicinity of the Point of Pines Yacht Club Parking lot, Rice Avenue, and Fowler Street. The Route 3 drill exit will be within Rice Avenue, which is a two-lane local street with concrete sidewalk and a concrete retaining wall abutting. Drill exit staging area operations are more limited in area and duration than those at the drill entry staging area. Activities will include driving of a starter casing, management and monitoring of fluids, and pipe pullback. Duration of activity in the drill exit staging area is estimated to be 1-month, as detailed in the project schedule attached in Appendix S. The first 2-weeks of operations at the drill exit staging area will require typical work week construction hours. The second two weeks of operations at the drill exit staging area will require 7-1 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY continuous activity at the site. Construction operations in the Route 3 drill exit staging area will require detour of traffic around the work zone. Open trench pipe installation in Rice Avenue and Hanson Street will require typical construction work zone management for water main installation in a local street, including detour of the work zone to through-traffic during typical construction hours. All staging areas, apart from the short-duration pipe sting construction area, shall be partitioned from public access by temporary construction fences and traffic control devices. Excavations will be protected from access, plated, or backfilled each day. In the City of Lynn staging area, clearing and grubbing of trees and brush may be required. Surfaces in easements should be restored with plantings similar to existing at the conclusion of work. Surfaces in public streets should be restored curb-to-curb within the work zone. Pavement restoration should include temporary trench patch, settlement for 90- days, and curb-to-curb pavement milling and overlay. Surface restoration will result in an aesthetically pleasing new roadway surface for abutters after conclusion of work. The finished pipeline will include fused or welded water main across the river, bell and spigot water main in local streets, and connections between dissimilar systems. Anchor blocks should be installed at the connection of the fused or welded river crossing pipe to the bell and spigot pipe. Anchor blocks will restrain against separation due to thermal expansion from seasonal variations in water supply temperature. The anchoring system will be buried without evidence from the surface. Aspects of the new water main system visible from the surface at project conclusion will include cabinets for cathodic protection and manhole covers associated with valve vaults. The valve vaults will house valves for system control and air release valves to discharge air trapped in the pipeline. They will be required at each end of the river crossing, at project the extents, and at intermediate locations as required. Vehicles should be allowed to drive-over vaults, as they will be structurally rated to carry vehicle loading, but location might be coordinated to limit incidence of vehicles consistently blocking access to the vault cover. One new cabinet for cathodic protection is assumed to be required on each end of the project. The cabinet will typically be located near the property line, accessible from the roadway, and placed to avoid conflict/obstruction. The cathodic protection cabinets have an aesthetic similar to a typical traffic signal cabinets or electrical lighting cabinets. 7.2 Land Acquisition and Easements Land acquisition and easement requirements were estimated for the recommended routes. “Temporary” easements are those required for the construction duration only. “Permanent” easements are those required for long-term pipeline occupation of a space. The limit of permanent easement, and the nature of use restrictions, should be consistent with that typically required of MWRA for its pipelines. Terms of permanent easement may include prohibiting permanent construction within a distance from the pipeline, prohibiting significant change in finished grade, maintaining accessibility, and compliance with the 8M Permit program. The MWRA may choose to purchase land instead of securing permanent easements. Appendix K includes a detailed tabulation of land acquisition and easements with more details including assessed values for buildings, features, and land. Property value and perceived depreciation value were relevant factors in Weston & Sampson’s estimation of probable cost of land acquisition. Occupation of Local Streets & Tidal Flat (Route 3 and Route 7) The MWRA may need to negotiate grants of location for new permanent occupation of public lands. Over-land cut & cover pipe installation is required in Hanson Street and Rice Avenue to connect the river 7-2 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY crossing pipe to the existing Section 56 water main in State Route 1A. Hanson Street and Rice Avenue are publicly accepted ways with local jurisdiction. Also, the new pipeline passes through a City of Lynn owned tidal flat (Parcel 033-752-065). Occupation of Drill Entry & Pipe String Construction Staging Area in Lynn (Route 3 and Route 7) Temporary easement for use of WMI Lynn LLC (Parcel 034-752-077), Massachusetts Electric Co (National Grid; Parcel 034-752-075), and Capri Properties (Walmart; 034-759-003) will be required for construction staging and pipe sting construction operations. Permanent easement at WMI Lynn LLC (Parcel 034-752-077) will be required for permanent pipe occupation. • The National Grid site, as described in Section 3.5.6, has an existing closed municipal landfill site which was capped in 1986 and is not receiving waste at this time. There does not appear to be significant activity at the site since operations are closed and transmission lines are removed. Pipe sting construction could be performed adjacent to the access road in the site without putting the existing landfill systems at-risk. • The WMI Lynn LLC site is owned by the same party developing the site described in Section 3.1.10, but there are no active plans for development at this time. The proposed pipe would be located near the property line and partially within the waterfront zoning offset (200-feet per), so it is estimated that the new pipeline will incur only modest future use limitation. As the land is currently utilized, it appears a good space to secure temporary easement for HDD drill entry and general pipeline project staging. • Beyond a finished parking lot in the rear used for loading, Walmart appears to own a section of unused land which might provide some working space at the rear of the drill entry staging area. Occupation of Drill Exit Staging Area in Revere (Route 3) Permanent easement with the Point of Pines Beach Association (Parcel 14-192O-23) will be required for permanent pipe occupation of the space between Rice Avenue and the low tide line. Occupation of Drill Exit Staging Area in Revere (Route 7) Temporary easement for use of the City of Revere Pump Station parking lot (Parcel Unknown) and the Point of Pines Yacht Club parking lot (Parcel 14-192O-14A) will be required for bore exit staging. Permanent easement at the City of Revere Pump Station parking lot (Parcel Unknown) will be required for permanent pipe occupation. • The parking lot off Rice Avenue proposed for Route 7 drill exit is partially owned by the City of Revere and partially owned by the Yacht Club. The proposed Route alternative proposes permanent pipe occupation in lands owned by the City of Revere. • Temporary easement with the City of Revere and the Point of Pines Yacht Club will be required to occupy space during the horizontal directional drill. Operations will likely require occupying substantial portions of the parking lot, and into Rice Avenue during reaming and pipe-pull. Some permanent use limitations may be required at the edge of the property to comply with MWRA buffer requirements. 7.3 Permits The permit matrix attached in Appendix J indicates permits required of the recommended route alternatives.

The MWRA should require the construction contractor to secure local Street Opening Permits with the City of Lynn and the City of Revere, and to contact Dig Safe prior to performing any excavation. 7.4 Risks and Risk Management Risks need to be considered at each stage of the Project, including planning, design, and implementation. The purpose of risk management is to assure that the project incorporates appropriate, efficient, and cost-effective measures to mitigate project related risk. Risks may be described and characterized with respect to “consequence of occurrence” and “likelihood of occurrence”. Tables 7 and 8 outline a basis for characterizing likelihood of occurrence and consequence of occurrence. 7-4 westonandsampson.com",

A list of identified risks is included below. A detailed description of the risk, consequence, and mitigation strategy is provided in Appendix Q, along with characterization of risk likelihood of occurrence and consequence of occurrence. Risks identified and detailed were as follows: • DES-001 Commercial Abutter Concerns • DES-002 Residential Abutter Concerns • DES-003 Emergency Services Concerns • DES-004 Local and State Leadership Concerns • DES-005 Permanent Easement Acquisition • DES-006 Temporary Easement Acquisition • DES-007 Permit Acquisition • DES-008 Identification of Unsuitable Subsurface Conditions • DES-009 Identify Obstructions in Bore Path • DES-010 Contaminated Materials Identification • DES-011 Coordination with Other Activities • CON-001 Conflict with Obstruction • CON-002 Inadvertent Return of Drilling Fluids to the Environment • CON-003 Drilling Fluid Circulation Loss • CON-004 Stuck Pipeline During Pullback • CON-005 Alignment Control 7-5 westonandsampson.com",

Design risk management activities should proceed as soon as practical to provide the greatest benefit. Construction risk management activities should be performed continuously during construction, and be supported by strong contract requirements and clear work/mitigation plan submittals. Key risks and risk mitigation approaches are described below. • DES-004: Local and State Leadership Concerns – The risk includes that the proposed project operations, and/or use of land, conflicts with leadership vision for the work area. The consequence of realizing the risk may include alternative route selection. To mitigate, the MWRA may inform applicable local and state leadership of the proposed scope and it’s project benefits, provide a venue for discourse over the scope of work and concerns, and incorporate measures into design that mitigate the concerns as practical. • DES-005: Permanent Easement Acquisition - The risk includes delay or failure to secure permanent easements required to rightfully occupy the proposed pipeline corridor. The consequence of realizing the risk may include alternative route selection or schedule delays. To mitigate, applicable property owners should be contacted as early as possible to ensure adequate time for acquisition of property. Early engagement would avoid investing excessive effort in an alternative that has limited chance of success. Study equitable recapitulation for permanent easements, prepare for presentation to key property owners, and administer negotiations. Critical negotiations will be with Point of Pines Beach Association and WMI Lynn LLC for Route 3. Critical negotiations will be with City of Revere and WMI Lynn LLC for Route #7. • DES-006: Temporary Easement Acquisition – The risk includes failure to secure temporary easements required on lands that would be occupied by construction operations. The consequence of realizing the risk is requisite alternative pipe string construction staging and/or pipeline routing. To mitigate, property owners should be contacted as early as possible to ensure adequate time for acquisition of temporary easement. Study equitable recapitulation for temporary easements, prepare for presentation to key property owners, and administer negotiations. Critical negotiations will be with Massachusetts Electric Co for Route 3, and Massachusetts Electric Co and Point of Pines Yacht Club for Route 7. • DES-007: Permit Acquisition – The risk includes that permit requirements may impact cost, schedule and/or approach viability. The consequence of realizing the risk is that permitting delays result in schedule slip and require provisions that increase program cost. To mitigate, incorporate into design sufficient accommodation for protecting public use of the waterways and 7-6 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY abutting recreational spaces, maintaining use of the navigable waterway, maintaining sufficient protection and contingency measures related to management of drilling fluids, and protection of natural resources including local beaches, species, and water resources. In the near term, the MWRA may introduce the proposed work to the applicable agencies of jurisdiction to open communications and receive preliminary feedback. • CON-001: Conflict with Obstruction - If the drill bit, reamer, or product pipe cannot be advanced past an obstruction, even by backing up and trying to steer around it, the impact can be significant. Typical obstructions include cobbles, boulders, wood, construction debris, and foundations. Along the proposed HDD alignment, there is potential to encounter any of these types of obstructions. In the extreme case, the HDD borehole may need to be abandoned and a new borehole drilled. Also, frac out along the piles, fouling of drilling fluids with suspended wood fibers, and impeding of forward progress is possible. Wood fibers could affect performance of the mud pumps or otherwise damage them. If an unknown obstruction is encountered during construction, the steering head can be pulled back and guided around the obstacle during pilot hole drilling, provided the change in alignment will not adversely impact pipe pullback. Execute contingency plan for mitigating inadvertent release of drilling fluids to environment (see below). The Route #7 alignment, at it’s angle to seawall, increases likelihood of conflict with the seawall piles, and reduces likelihood that course adjustment will be able to remedy a conflict. Also, the location where Route #7 enters Revere is estimated to have a higher probability to encounter unknown historic piers associated with maritime activity. • CON-002: Inadvertent Return of Drilling Fluids to the Environment - Inadvertent return of drilling fluid to the environment may be characterized as a “fracout” or a “hydrofracture”. “Frac out” refers to an event where drilling fluid is released during drilling through a preferential seepage path along piers, piles, loose gravel, rocks or improperly backfilled test borings. “Hydrofracture” refers to an event where drilling fluid pressure overcomes the overburden pressure to release into the environment. Inadvertent returns are typically encountered where the ground cover is low such as near the entry and exit pits and drilling fluid pressures are high. The consequence of realizing the risk includes release of drilling fluids to the environment, possible curtailing of drilling operations, possible cost and schedule implications of required approach adjustment and clean-up. The risk of inadvertent returns can be mitigated by providing sufficient ground cover, attentiveness to drill advance rates, proper drill fluid design and circulation, installing \"starter\" casings near the entry and exit pits to confine the drilling fluid. Subsurface exploration should inform design to limit risk of hydrofracture under the river due to insufficient depth. • CON-013: Abutter Concerns - The risk includes that abutter concerns result in vocal opponents of the project during construction. The consequence of realizing the risk is that abutter concerns result in poor public opinion of the project and delays as executive issues are addressed. To mitigate, public participation conferences may be conducted in design, pre-construction, and during construction to provide venue to hear, acknowledge, and address abutter concerns. The construction contract may also include work-hour, noise, and sequence provisions to minimize impact to abutters during construction. 7-7 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 7.5 Cost Estimate Detailed program cost estimates were prepared for Route 3 and Route 7. Detailed estimates were prepared for use establishing a program budget, therefore accuracy was critical. The approach to estimation included solicitation of price quotes from suppliers and contractors where appropriate, and modeling equipment and labor expense based on task durations outlined in Section 7.6 of this Report. The detailed tabulation of estimated program costs, as well as statement of assumptions and price backup, is attached as Appendix R. The estimates included construction, engineering, land acquisition and easements, engineering, and contingency costs: • Engineering expense included contract professional services furnished for engineering design, construction administration, and resident representation. Engineering design included subsurface exploration, survey and base map, design, permitting, and bidding. The scope and cost for subsurface exploration is detailed in Section 7.7 of this report, and is estimated at 5.5% of construction cost. Survey and base map includes land and marine survey activities plus development of a detailed base map, and is estimated at 2% of construction cost. Design includes preliminary and final design activities and is estimated at 3% of construction cost. Permitting includes acquisition of permits described in Section 7.3, and is estimated at 1% of construction cost. Bidding includes support from preparation of the final bid documents through recommendation to award of a construction contract, and is estimated at 0.5% of construction cost. Construction Administration is estimated at 5% of construction cost, and resident engineer expense is estimated at 10% of construction cost. The allocation for resident engineering was confirmed adequate to support one senior resident engineer and one junior resident engineer throughout the construction period. The ratio engineering to construction expense is 27%. • Land Acquisition and Easements was estimated as described in Section 5.1, and as detailed in Appendix K. The value of easements was estimated based on land value and estimated reduction in beneficial use, not a percent of construction cost. • Construction cost estimates were based on general contractor costs extended from task durations, estimated labor/equipment resource application by task, and applicable labor/equipment rates. Quotes were secured for supply and specialty subcontractors costs. Task durations were generally per typical production rates published for operations of this length and pipe diameter. These task durations were confirmed with a qualified HDD contractor from Houston Texas. General Contractor labor and equipment resource application, and overhead expenses, were gathered from discussions with qualified Massachusetts general contractors. General contractor labor estimates accounted-for periods requiring continuous (24-hour), and typical (8-hour), operations, as well as varying labor demands by task (full 6-person crew, or reduced 3-person crew). Labor rates were per Massachusetts Prevailing Wage. Equipment rental and operating costs were from Equipment Watch Blue Book rates. Supply costs were secured via quote from qualified supply contractors. The estimate provides for upsizing the Section 56 crossing of the Saugus River to 30” diameter, as requested by the MWRA. The estimate carries fusible PVC pipe for HDD river crossing and ductile iron pipe for open trench installation on-land. Weston & Sampson believes that the program estimate is sufficiently conservative to support selection of an alternative HDD pipe material if preferred in preliminary design, as described further in Section 7.8. Spoils disposal assumes 50% will be disposed or reused at an in-state landfill, and 50% will be disposed or reused at an out-of-state landfill. Uniformed officers for traffic control are included. 7-8 westonandsampson.com",

Cathodic protection systems may require replacement over the lifecycle period, however the cost for this replacement is unsubstantial compared to overall project capital costs. Therefore, this review assumes that no substantial maintenance of the system will be required for the 30-year capital analysis period. 7.6 Schedule Estimate Detailed schedule estimates were prepared for Route 3 and Route 7. Schedule estimation included identification of program tasks, defining sequence dependencies, and estimating duration required of tasks. Task duration assumptions were based on HDD design literature and discussion with qualified service providers. Project schedules, prepared in Microsoft Project, are attached as Appendix S. Notes describing the basis for construction duration, sequence, and seasonal restrictions are also included in Appendix S. Schedule tasks included Procurement of a Consultant, Preliminary Design, Final Design, Permitting, Bid Ready Documents, Land Acquisition and Easements, Bidding and Award, and Construction. • Procurement of a Consultant will result in securing contract engineering services from a consultant. 9-months have been allowed for procurement of a consultant. • Preliminary Design was typically estimated to require 10-months, and will include survey, subsurface exploration, base map development, a preliminary design report, and preliminary 7-9 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY design plans and specification. A period for MWRA review and comment was included. Preliminary design is the first phase of contract engineering services. • Final Design includes a complete engineered set of contract drawings and contract specification. Weston & Sampson assumed that Final Design activities would begin immediately after MWRA acceptance of the Preliminary Design Report. A period for MWRA review was allowed. Final Design is estimated to require 5-months. • Bid Ready Documents incorporate revisions and requirements identified through Permitting, Land Acquisition, and stakeholder engagement. Bid Ready Documents were estimated to require 5-months and conclude 2-months following completion of Permitting. • Permitting was estimated to begin after Preliminary Design documents are reviewed, approved, and amended. The duration of the Permitting period was 11-months. The Mass DEP Chapter 91 permit was the driver of the permitting duration (9-months to process) and was sequenced after securing Conservation Commission Order of Conditions. • Land Acquisition and Easements involves negotiation of easements with project area land owners. Abutters should also be canvassed during this period. Land Acquisition and Easements should begin as soon as practical, therefore it is modeled to begin before completion of Procurement of a Consultant. The task will conclude after completing the Geotechnical, Hazardous Materials, Environmental, and Corrosion Investigation. Land Acquisition and Easements is allowed 12-months. • Bidding and Award is estimated to require 6-months. This task will follow completion of all other tasks, and result in a secured construction contractor. As constituted, the program schedule completes Bid Ready Documents too late in the 2020 season to provide for construction mobilization in 2020, therefore a 90-day period is provided between completion of Bid Ready Documents and Advertisement for Bid. Timing bid later in the season, and more proximate to the intended construction start, will result in greater interest from bidders. • Construction involves implementation of river crossing and on-land water main installation. Construction is the final phase of the project. Task duration was estimated as the sum of associated construction tasks, including mobilization, HDD river crossing pipe installation, open trench pipe installation, and surface restoration. Construction mobilization was estimated to require about 3-months. HDD site preparation was estimated to require about 42-days. HDD drilling operations were estimated to require about 14-days. HDD post-drilling operations were estimated to require about 45-days. Open trench pipe installation was estimated to require about 86-days for Route 3, and 64-days for Route 7. Given probable seasonal restrictions applicable to Route 3 work at the end of Point of Pines, it is estimated that open trench pipe installation will occur in the first half of the 2021, and HDD operations will occur in the second half of 2021. As Route 7 does not have this restriction, it is estimated that HDD will occur in the first half of the 2021, and open trench pipe installation will occur in the second half of 2021. Schedule estimates for Route 3 and Route 7 include design and permitting performed over a 24-month period from March 2018 to March 2020, and bidding and award over a 6-month period from June 2020 to December 2020. Land acquisition and easement negotiation is advised to begin as soon as practical and conclude early in design. Construction of Route 3 might be phased with pipe installation in Rice Avenue and Hanson Street in spring/summer 2021, directional drill performed in summer/fall 2021 (after a threatened bird species vacates the Point of Pines area), and surface restoration and finishing works in fall 2021. Route 3 requires construction operations from April 2021 through October 2021 to complete the scope of work (approximately 7-months).

Route 7 requires construction operations from April 2021 through September 2021 to complete the scope of work (approximately 6-months). 7.7 Recommended Subsurface Exploration Design of an HDD installation requires reliable subsurface information along the installation route to depths sufficient to support project design and construction. Sufficient and reliable subsurface information is critical to limiting the risk of differing subsurface conditions claims during construction for protection of the interests of the project owner. The available subsurface information indicates the northern and southern land areas are formed of surficial fill layers of variable thickness and composition, overlying an organic soil layer, followed by a relatively thin sand layer and then marine clay with glacial till and bedrock. The river channel generally consists of a soft organic sediment layer of variable thickness overlying marine clay with glacial till and bedrock between 80 and 120 ft. below mudline. An investigation program is proposed to collect information to define subsurface soil conditions and identify potential for obstructions along Route 3 and Route 7 alignments. It should be noted that the recommendations presented herein are based on preliminary information. As design progresses, the recommendations should be refined appropriately. 7.7.1 Design-Phase Geotechnical Investigation Recommendations The issues to be addressed by subsurface explorations include: • Defining subsurface conditions at proposed entry and exit site locations for evaluating measures to limit risks of ground collapse, and drill fluid breakout, • Improving our understanding of subsurface conditions along potential HDD drill alignments and cut-and-cover pipeline installation alignments, • Clarifying conditions at potential HDD obstructions such as the Lynn seawall and Point-of-Pines seawall, and • Determining river bottom bathymetry and soft sediment thickness along the HDD alignments. The recommended geotechnical investigation program includes test borings, exploratory excavations, field soil index testing, and geotechnical laboratory testing as described below. HDD Bore Entry Site (Lynn Waterfront) One test boring should be drilled within the anticipated bore entry pit footprint. The entry pit footprint in this area is approximately the same for both Routes 3 and 7, so one test boring is considered sufficient. The boring should be advanced through surficial fill and organic soils using hollow stem auger drilling methods. Continuous split-spoon soil sampling should be conducted from ground surface through fill and organic soils until at least two samples are obtained in the underlying native marine clay. The remaining boring depth may be advanced using drive-and-wash casing methods with split-spoon sampling conducted through the marine clay at 5 ft. intervals of depth (standard sampling interval) until the boring encounters the underlying glacial till or bedrock. Completed boreholes should be fully backfilled by tremie grouting with cement-bentonite grout (5% cement mix). 7-11 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY A test pit excavation program should also be conducted to identify conditions at the Lynn seawall along both potential HDD routes. Available information suggests a timber bulkhead at the edge of land supported by battered piles and by horizontal tie rods connected to a deadman anchorage system approximately 30 ft. inland of the bulkhead. Lengths of piles are unknown but are likely to be between 40 and 60 ft. Depths, types and spacing of horizontal tie rods are unknown. In addition, the tie rod anchorage system type, geometry and component spacing are also unknown. The test pit excavation program should be designed and conducted to identify this type of information for inclusion on subsurface profiles so that potential interference with HDD installation can be assessed and measures designed to reduce the risk of interference during construction. Test pit excavations will need to comply with OSHA trenching regulations and should be backfilled to comply with the landowner’s requirements, which would be ascertained during final planning of the test boring and test excavation program. Assume two days in the field with a tracked excavator will be required to complete the excavation program. HDD Bore Exit Site (Revere Waterfront) One test boring should be conducted within the footprint of each conceptual bore exit pit location on the Revere waterfront side of the project (two test borings total). Each boring should be advanced through surficial fill and organic soils using hollow stem auger drilling methods. Continuous split-spoon soil sampling should be conducted from ground surface through fill and organic soils until at least two samples are obtained in the underlying native marine clay. The remaining boring depth should be advanced using drive-and-wash casing methods with split-spoon sampling conducted through the marine clay at 5 ft. intervals of depth (standard sampling interval) until the boring encounters the underlying glacial till or bedrock. Completed boreholes should be fully backfilled by tremie grouting with cement-bentonite grout (5% cement mix). The concrete seawall along the northern shore of the Point-of-Pines neighborhood likely has either a timber pile foundation or a boulder fill foundation. It is also possible there is no foundation other than native beach sand. In any event, the foundation conditions should be explored for potential interference with HDD installation as part of final design. A shallow test pit (3 to 4 ft. depth) along the land side of the blocks is recommended to access the foundation zone below the wall. Careful hand excavation below the wall from the test pit may be necessary to expose the foundation conditions. Assume one day of test pit excavation and documentation of condition will be required for this effort. Cut-and-Cover Alignments Test borings should be drilled along all cut-and-cover alignments at approximately 300 ft. spacing. The borings should be drilled using hollow-stem auger drilling methods with continuous split-spoon sampling to at least 20 ft. below grade. Completed boreholes should be fully backfilled with soil cuttings sealed with cold patch. HDD Alignments At least three test borings should be drilled along each potential HDD alignment (six test borings total) where they cross the mouth of the river. The borings should be advanced using drive-and-wash casing drilling methods from a barge-mounted drill rig. One boring should be located at approximately the center of the channel for each alignment.

Water boring locations should be offset approximately 20 ft. laterally from the anticipated HDD alignments. Continuous split-spoon samples should be collected from each boring within the upper 10 ft. below the river channel mudline to confirm the thickness and composition of soft sediments at each location. Thin wall tube samples (30-inch length) should be collected in the marine clay beginning at 10 ft. below mudline at 15 ft. to 20 ft. depth intervals, with split-spoon samples collected immediately before and after each tube sample and at 5 ft. depth intervals between tubes until the boring encounters glacial till or bedrock. Completed boreholes should be fully backfilled by tremie grouting with cement-bentonite grout (5% cement mix) to approximately 6 ft. below the mudline. The thin wall tube samples should be properly sealed with wax after conducting field index testing (i.e. pocket penetrometer testing, Torvane shear testing and field classification), and carefully delivered to a geotechnical laboratory for testing. Each tube sample should be opened in the laboratory, processed and tested for index properties including pocket penetrometer and Torvane testing, Atterberg limits, natural moisture content, specific gravity and unit weight determinations and grain size distribution analyses (including hydrometer analyses). It should be noted that project design should include detailed bathymetry of the river bottom and identification of the range of thickness and composition of soft sediments along the HDD alignment for evaluating minimum depth of cover for the entire alignment. This memorandum considers bathymetric sounding, sub-bottom profiling, and side-scan sonar as part of survey scope required for the project. As such, the estimated cost for those services is not included in the subtotals of Section 7.7.3, but rather in the detailed cost estimate allowance for “Survey and Basemap”. Geophysical survey for near surface obstructions (metallic objects, concrete/granite blocks) in the fill material near the HDD entry/exit area located in Lynn is included. 7.7.2 Design-Phase Environmental Investigation Recommendations Review of available files from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) identified several known state-listed disposal sites within or proximate to the Section 56 project area. The review also identified the presence of contaminated historical fill materials on the Lynn side of the Saugus River as well as a closed municipal landfill formerly operated by the City of Lynn north of the proposed HDD entry point on Hanson Street. Based on these findings, an environmental investigation should be conducted to evaluate soil and groundwater conditions and assess the extent of oil and hazardous materials (OHM) that may be encountered. The investigation should also be performed to obtain representative characterization data that will assist with soil and groundwater management planning and obtaining necessary approvals or permits from off-site soil disposal facilities or regulatory agencies overseeing groundwater treatment/discharge. The environmental investigation should be conducted concurrently with design-phase geotechnical investigations and include: • Field screening exposed soil samples for visual/olfactory evidence of contamination (i.e., staining, odors, etc.) and jar headspace using a photoionization detector (PID). • Installation of eight (8) groundwater monitoring wells to measure groundwater levels and characterize groundwater quality on the Lynn and Revere sides of the Saugus River; and • The collection of soil and groundwater samples for laboratory analysis. 7-13 westonandsampson.com",

This path will require a bore entry angle sufficient to pass under timber piles associated with the Lynn seawall, and steering sufficient to level the bore path in firmer blue clays above underlying softer clay and glacial till, while retaining sufficient depth of cover under the Saugus River bottom. Space for drill entry staging, and complete construction of the pipe string, appear to be available in privately parcels in the Lynn Harbor area provided easements can be secured. The Section 56 water main is in the MWRA’s High Pressure service zone which has a hydraulic grade line (HGL) of the 280 feet, relative Boston City Base (BCB) datum. At BCB elevation zero, which is approximately equivalent to mean low water level, working pressure based on HGL is estimated at 121 psi. With the proposed HDD pipe conceptually installed up to 50 feet below mean low water, the pipeline at the lowest-elevation point is estimated to have a working pressure of approximately 143 psi. During HDD installation pipe experiences a combination of tensile, bending, and compressive stresses. These installation forces must be accounted for individually and in combination. They are significantly impacted by the installation alignment, borehole conditions, and fluid conditions. In addition to installation forces, pre-installation forces and operating stresses need to be considered. Often in long installations the installation stresses can exceed the operating stresses and become the determining factor in pipe dimension design. Pipe dimension selection should be calculated during the design phase of the project based on the design pipe route and subsurface conditions. Any reference to specific pipe thickness classes or dimension ratios herein are provided for comparison purposes per vendor rule of thumb estimation based on conceptual route length, depth, and operating pressure, and will vary from actual requirements to be identified in design. Typical pipe materials used in HDD include steel, ductile iron (“DI”), high density polyethylene (“HDPE”), and fusible polyvinyl chloride (“FPVC”). These materials were screened for comparative advantage and disadvantage Section 4.7 of this report. In general plastic pipes (HDPE and FPVC) were identified as more advantageous than metal pipe (steel and DI) due to corrosion resistance, advantageous hydraulics throughout pipe lifecycle, and reduced installed costs. Where metal pipes will rely on coatings, encasement, and cathodic protection to reduce internal and external corrosion, plastic pipes do not similarly corrode in typical soil conditions. The interior profile of fused plastic pipes is smooth, and does not accumulate tuberculation on the interior. Supply cost of plastic pipe is typically less than metal pipe, and installation cost is generally less due to reduced product weight and ease of handling. 7-15 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Jointing of pipe is critical in a HDD application. HDPE, FPVC, and Steel in HDD application would utilize continuously fused or welded joints. DI in HDD application would utilize restrained joints. Most restrained joint systems have bells which protrude and effectively increase the outside diameter of the installed pipe system, which increases bore diameter. Restrained joint DI pipe systems are often used in HDD installations where space limitations preclude assembly of a complete pipe string. One-joint-at-a-time assembly of restrained joints is referred to as a “cartridge” installation method. Fused and welded joints, executed in a controlled environment, provide for great confidence in the viability of the joint, allow for ready testing, and eliminate reliance on ancillary materials, such as gaskets, for long term pipeline integrity. HDPE, FPVC, and steel, are available in standard size and material characteristics required of this potable water application. FPVC pipe of the size required by this project is specified for potable water use in ANSI/AWWA C900-16 Standard for Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Pressure Pipe and Fabricated Fittings, 4-In Through 60-In (recently superseded ANSI/AWWA C905). HDPE pipe for of the size required by this project is specified for potable water use in ANSI/AWWA C906 Polyethylene (PE) Pressure Pipe and Fittings. Underground Solutions is the sole manufacturer of their patented/proprietary fusible PVC pipe system. Their “Fusible C-905” fusible PVC pipe for potable water is available in pipe sizes 14” to 36” in a variety of standard Dimension Ratios (DR). HDPE potable water pipe and fusing systems are an open market with many manufacturers producing pipe of a broad range of sizes and dimension ratios. HDPE, FPVC, and steel have been used in numerous potable water HDD applications of same or larger diameter. Weston & Sampson summarizes herein key differences between pipe material alternatives FPVC, HDPE, and Steel, as they relate to HDD: • As summarized previously, FPVC and HDPE have greater corrosion resistance, advantageous hydraulics throughout lifecycle, and reduced installed costs compared to steel. Where steel will rely on coatings, wraps, and cathodic protection to reduce internal and external corrosion, plastic pipes do not similarly corrode in typical soil conditions. The interior profile of fused plastic pipes is smooth, and does not accumulate tuberculation on the interior. Supply cost of plastic pipe is typically less than metal pipe, and installation cost is generally less due to reduced product weight and ease of handling. • HDPE flexibility supports ease of installation. On land, the pipe string can be easily navigated around obstructions and oriented in-line with the bore path. For a 30” HDPE pipe, the minimum published radius of curvature is approximately 60-feet. For 30” FPVC it is approximately 670- feet. For 30” steel it is around 3,000-feet. FPVC pipe will require greater care to align bore path with pipe string orientation than HDPE, and steel will require significantly greater care to align relative both plastic options. Figures 1D and 2D, in Appendix O, demonstrate the maximum allowable radius of curvature overlaid on the Pipe String Staging area for Routes 3 and 7, respectively. In the bore hole, the maximum allowed deflection angle of drill rod joints will limit the radius of curvature practical of the bore hole. This will align the actual allowable bore-radius of curvature for HDPE to align more closely with that allowed by FPVC. • HDPE is resilient through the rigors of installation due to its wall thickness, tolerance for abrasion, and elasticity. Fusible PVC and steel will require greater care in handling. • Steel and FPVC have substantially greater stiffness than HDPE, which contributes to better resisting of external loads, such as earth loading should the bore hole collapse. Steel has substantially greater stiffness than each FPVC and HDPE. Estimated loadings on pipe will 7-16 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY require detailed review during design. At this time, it appears that each alternative can each be engineered to adequately accommodate anticipated loads. • HDPE and steel have better resistance to recurring surge pressures than FPVC for comparable pressure class pipe. AWWA C905 requires FPVC pipe to sustain an occasional surge pressure 1.6 times maximum working pressure rating, but does not provide for additional allowance for recurring surge pressures. AWWA C906 requires HDPE pipe to sustain an occasional surge pressure 2 times maximum working pressure rating, and 1.5 times maximum working pressure for recurring surge pressures. The design team should consider whether the Section 56 pipeline is likely to be subject to recurring surge pressures. • Some studies indicate that HDPE has inferior resistance to hydrocarbon permeability and chlorine induced oxidation. These risks may be limited given the actual subsurface conditions and wall thickness that will be required of HDD pipe installation. Each risk can be assessed during pipe selection in Preliminary Design. • FPVC has a density of 1.40, which means it will sink in most aqueous solutions, reducing friction on the top of the bore hold due to floating of the pipe. HDPE pipe has a specific gravity of 0.95 and will float in an aqueous solution. In HDD application, a floating pipe incurs friction with the top of the bore hole and increase pulling force required. • FPVC and steel have reduced wall thickness compared to HDPE, which means a smaller bore hole is required to install the same inside-dimension pipe. A larger bore diameter means additional reaming duration, additional drilling fluids required, and additional material disposal expense. Risks and expense increase with increased bore hole diameter. • HDPE and steel are more resilient to cold temperatures during installation. FPVC becomes brittle in cold temperatures and it is not advised that it be installed in winter weather temperatures. Pipe fusing and installation would need to be coordinated for a period with low risk of freezing temperatures. • FPVC and steel expand and contract less than HDPE from temperature variation and pipe stresses. This will facilitate connection of FPVC and steel to existing buried pipe at the HDD extents. Typical pipe materials used in HDD include steel, DI, HDPE, and FPVC. Final pipe material selection should be determined in the design phase of the project based on detailed evaluation of existing conditions, design stresses, and required alignment geometry. Cost estimates for Route 3 and Route 7 in Section 7.5 carry FPVC. The cost for steel and ductile iron pipe installation will be greater than FPVC. The cost for HDPE pipe installation is approximately equivalent to FPVC, and will vary depending on the dimension ratio identified required in Preliminary Design.

        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY 8.0 CONCLUSIONS Inspection revealed that the existing Section 56 water main supported on the General Edwards Bridge is in poor to serious condition. Typical pitting on the exterior of the water main was 0.125 to 0.25 inches deep. Three (3) locations of previous pipe blowout were observed. The tower portions of the pipe were not visible for inspection due to existing insulation. Pipe extending to tunnel shafts, as well as at the top of each tunnel shaft, was observed in poor condition. Many pipe supports were observed in poor condition. The General Edwards Bridge is over 80-years old and currently rated “structurally deficient”. The water main in its existing location is exposed to risk from weather, as evidenced by current condition, and from human activities, as indicated by extensive graffiti on the water main at the north bridge abutment. Routes for river crossing were reviewed from the Saugus River confluence with the Pines River to the west, through the mouth of the Saugus River at Lynn Harbor to the east. Installation methods including open trench river crossing, horizontal directional drilling, microtunneling, and removal and replacement on the bridge were considered. River crossing routes alternatives can generally be grouped in one of four geographic areas relative to the existing bridge: • On Bridge (Route 8): Installed under the bridge and in a tunnel, in an alignment approximately congruous that of the existing water main. • Abutting the Bridge (Route 4, Route 5): Included routes immediately adjacent to the existing bridge corridor. This area provided for more direct route alignments, but incurred substantial risk of encountering piles associated with existing and historic structures in the area, including those associated with historic docks and piers, the existing railroad bridge, the demolished historic bridge, the General Edwards Bridge, and fenders associated with each historic bridge structure. • West of Bridge (Route 6): Included routes to the west of the bridge corridor. This area required long trenchless pipe installation lengths, substantial over land pipe installation, and encountered sensitive environmental receptors, developer interests, and local interests. • East of the Bridge (Route 1, Route 2, Route 3, Route 7): Included routes to the east of the bridge corridor. This area provided accessible paths for open trench and microtunneling pipe installation at a modest distance from the bridge. Space constraints between the shore and a proposed development required HDD to be shifted farther east to find adequate space for staging areas and pipe string construction. River crossings to the far east required longer river crossing and on-land pipe installation, but provided reduced risk of encountering historic obstructions and foundation structures of the Lynn Seawall. Each alternative was evaluated with respect to finished “pipeline performance” and “program risks”. Pipeline performance criteria included Access for Maintenance, Protection Against Damage, and Hydraulics, and program risks criteria included Permitting Approval Difficulty, Technical Complexity, Construction Risk, Environmental Risk, Impact on Abutters & Motorists, Easements & Land Acquisition, and MassDOT/DCR Support. Route alternatives were evaluated against criteria and assigned a score of one to five. The sum of ratings applied to pipeline performance and program risks criteria became the composite, or total, rating. Program cost and program schedule were estimated for each alternative. 8-1 westonandsampson.com",
        "MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY FEASIBILITY STUDY Horizontal directional drill pipe installation from Hanson Street, in the City of Lynn, to Rice Avenue, in the City of Revere, provided for the two most highly ranked alternatives (Route 3 and Route 7). The microtunneling alternative was rated favorably from a performance and risk perspective, but had the highest cost and a longer schedule duration. The open trench river crossing alternative was comparable in cost to HDD options, but included greater environmental risk, greater permitting difficulty, and a longer schedule duration. The alternative for pipe replacement on the bridge scored less favorably due to reduced protection against damage, hydraulic limitations, greater technical complexity, and greater construction risk. The two highly ranked horizontal directional drill routes each propose drill entry and pipe string construction from near Hanson Street in Lynn, but differ in their location of drill exit. Drill exit for Route 3 is near the end of the Point of Pines on Rice Avenue, and for Route 7 it is near the Point of Pines Yacht Club just off Rice Avenue.

Weston & Sampson recommends that both Route 3 and Route 7 be carried forward into preliminary design for further evaluation. As detailed in Appendix Q, risks associated with obstruction by the seawall (DES-009, CON-001, CON-002), easement acquisition (DES-005, DES-006), and abutter concerns (DES-001, DES-002, DES-003, DES-004, CON- 013) will be better understood in preliminary design after execution of the recommended subsurface exploration program, engagement of abutters, and initiation of access/easement negotiation. The additional subsurface exploration required to evaluate two alternatives includes four additional borings and one additional test pit, so overall additional resource expenditure is modest. Using the preferred Route 3 program cost and schedule for program capital planning will secure a more conservative budgetary cost and schedule estimate. Each route will require land access/acquisition agreements and/or easements to provide for construction access and pipeline occupation.

Land acquisition and easement negotiation is advised to begin as soon as practical and conclude early in design. Construction of Route 3 might be phased with pipe installation in Rice Avenue and Hanson Street in spring/summer 2021, directional drill performed in summer/fall 2021 (after a threatened bird species vacates the Point of Pines area), and surface restoration and finishing works in fall 2021. Route 3 requires construction operations from April 2021 through October 2021 to complete the scope of work (approximately 7-months). Construction of Route 7 might be phased with directional drill performed in spring 2021, pipe installation in Rice Avenue and Hanson Street in summer 2021, and surface restoration in fall 2021. Route 7 requires construction operations from April 2021 through September 2021 to complete the scope of work (approximately 6-months). In conclusion, Weston & Sampson recommends abandoning the existing Section 56 crossing of the Saugus River and replacing it with a new river crossing, installed via horizontal directional drill, from Hanson Street in Lynn to Rice Avenue in Revere. Route 3 and Route 7 should be carried forward into preliminary design. Preliminary design activities should advance understanding of risks associated with obstructions, abutter concerns, and easements, and facilitate route selection. Open cut pipe installation will be required on land to connect the new river crossing to the existing Section 56 water main in the Lynnway. Route 3 has an estimated program cost of $10,651,147 (March 2017 ENR Boston CCI 13,710.37), requires 7-months of construction operations, and has an estimated project substantial completion date in October 2021.
