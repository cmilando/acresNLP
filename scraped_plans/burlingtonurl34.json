The 6th National Risk Assessment: Hazardous Heat l © First Street FoundationThe 6th National Risk Assessment: Hazardous Heat l © First Street Foundation 4 Abstract Figure 1. How wIll heat affect America The First Street Foundation Extreme Heat Model (FSF-EHM) builds upon open datasets from the US Federal Government, augmented with publicly available and third party data sources, and existing research and expertise on heat modeling. The model estimates localized heat risk at a 30-meter resolution across the United States today and 30 years into the future, creating a high- precision, climate-adjusted heat model that provides insights at a property level. The results indicate that the incidence of extreme heat is growing across the country, both in absolute and relative terms. In absolute terms, the incidence of heat that exceeds the threshold of the National Weather Service’s (NWS) highest category for heat, called “Extreme Danger” (Heat Index above 125°F) is expected to impact about 8 million people this year, increasing to about 107 million people in 2053, an increase of 13 times over 30 years. This increase in “Extreme Danger Days” is concentrated in the middle of the country, in areas where there are no coastal influences to mitigate extreme temperatures. The West Coast of the country has the From Texas to Chicago in the Upper The Gulf and Southeastern Atlantic highest probability of experiencing long Midwest, the central US is at risk of the regions of the country will face the highest durations of Local Hot Days, which have most extreme levels of heat exposure, probability and longest duration of exposure NOTE: All temperatures presented here are the “feels like” temperature (heat index). been tied directly to disproportionate levels temperatures exceeding 125°F heat index, to Dangerous Days (days over 100°F). of heat fatigue, stroke, and mortality. forming an Extreme Heat Belt through the middle of the country.The 6th National Risk Assessment: Hazardous Heat l © First Street Foundation 5 Abstract This zone, termed here the “Extreme Heat of Extreme Danger Days, all areas across Texas, even as the absolute temperature current environment to occur up to 30+ Belt,” stretches from the Northern border the country are expected to experience increase in Texas is much higher. “Local days in 2053.

When examining the number of days at that same temperature in 30 years, the country is expected to see increases in the incidence of Local Hot Days across the board. The largest increases occur in the southern half of the country, while the smallest increases in the amount of Local Hot Days between this year and 2053 are spread over the northernmost region of the country. For many places within the southernmost region, those hottest 7 days grow to about 30 days at the same temperature in 2053. This means that what would have hypothetically been the hottest week of the year in 2023, becomes the hottest month of the year in 2053. Florida is expected to see the greatest increases in Local Hot Days in 30 years relative to today, with Miami-Dade and Lee Counties both seeing increases to over 34 days.The 6th National Risk Assessment: Hazardous Heat l © First Street Foundation 11 Model Development In order to understand the property level supplemented by a regional trend analysis local air temperatures.

Land surface temperature Air temperature The covariates used to calibrate the model were chosen based on previous research (Johnson et al., 2020; Kloog et al., 2014; L. Shi et al., 2016; D.

The surface water layer was filtered to remove small ponds and streams that were unlikely to affect air temperature. Ultimately, a spatial modeling approach Elevation was used for evaluating the relationship between observed temperature records and covariates at climate data stations. Using this approach, there is a continuous field which models air temperature smoothly Distance to water over space, where the values of the air temperature field are grounded at specific, known locations, and are interpolated for areas between those known locations.

The panel on the left highlights the fact that most of the country experiences fewer than 20 days of heat index temperatures above 100°F. The exception exists in the areas around the Gulf and Southeastern Atlantic Coast where the heat index temperatures are expected to reach 100°F roughly 100 days a year. Using the same scale, the 2053 portion of the figure shows those already hot locations reach heat index values above 100°F over 120 days in 30 years. Additionally, there is dramatic growth in the number of Dangerous Days throughout Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Florida, and the Deep South. Figure 8.

Unlike the Extreme Danger Days above 125°F, which mainly impact the middle of the country, the Dangerous Days impact is primarily centered in the Southern region of the country. Texas and Florida are most pronounced with regard to their exposure to Dangerous Days at over 100 days this year. Throughout California, Arizona, and the Deep South states of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, there are large population centers exposed to at least 50 Dangerous Days per year. In 2053 the patterns remain relatively constant, but there is a noticeable increase in days above the heat index temperature of 100°F throughout the southeastern US. Figure 9.

Figure 10 highlights the fact that locations in Florida and along the Gulf Coast are likely to experience over 30 additional days over 100°F by 2053. Understanding what areas in the United States will face the greatest increase in the number of Dangerous Days is important in order to equip communities with the insights needed to deal with the impacts associated with these temperatures. This is especially important when thinking about health conditions, the availability of air conditioning, and strain on the energy grid during periods of high demand.The 6th National Risk Assessment: Hazardous Heat l © First Street Foundation 18 Dangerous Days Figure 11. Largest change in Dangerous Days, 2023 - 2053 In the future, Florida is expected to continue to have the greatest increase in the number of Dangerous Days, making up 18 of the top 20 counties for the largest difference in the number of days between this year and 30 years in the future. The remaining two counties for the largest increase in the number of Dangerous Days are located in Louisiana. Topping the list are Desoto, Okeechobee, Palm Beach, Broward, and St. Lucie Counties. The patterns also seem to highlight a protective effect of high elevation along the Appalachian mountains and much of the higher elevation areas on the Western half of the country. ºFThe 6th National Risk Assessment: Hazardous Heat l © First Street Foundation 19 Heat Waves The impact of extreme heat is heightened a relative threshold set at the Local Hot Day country, with some areas unlikely to see across the Southern United States have when it is experienced for multiple days in temperature.

CO Emissions by state due to AC usage 2023 and 2053 2 Using the EIA’s state level summary statistics for electricity profiles based on the average energy mix through the year (2020 was the most recent confirmed year), energy consumption can further be converted to pounds (lbs.) of Carbon Dioxide (CO ) emissions 2 per energy unit. This conversion allows us to understand how emissions related to air conditioning usage will change if all else is held constant. Texas and Florida are by far the largest consumers of energy for cooling purposes in the US. This high demand is driven by the intersection of the greater number of properties and the extreme number of CDDs in the local area. In both cases, the current levels of CO emissions from cooling exceed 30 billion 2 pounds and are expected to grow to around 35 billion pounds over the next 30 years.

Information on heat risk at a high-resolution under current climate conditions as well as in the future allow for better informed decision-making around risk avoidance, adaptation options, and property preparation. Understanding how heat risks change over time under future environmental conditions at a high-resolution is important for property owners, local governments, investors, and other decision makers to undertake the necessary actions for protecting their assets and health, and to price this risk into their decision-making processes. This report highlights how heat risks change in different ways for different regions of the county. California, Texas, and Florida are expected to experience the largest increases in costs, consumption, and CO emissions associated with air conditioning usage (holding all 2 else constant), which may have important implications when considering energy market summertime capacity. The central and Midwestern regions of the country face the highest probabilities of experiencing Extreme Danger Days, or days exceeding a 125°F heat index. This region’s risk of Extreme Danger Days increases in the future, leading to the emergence of the Extreme Heat Belt. The West Coast of the country has the highest probability of experiencing Consecutive Local Hot Days, or days at or above temperatures which those areas may not be acclimated to. Finally, the Gulf and Southeastern Atlantic will face the greatest number of Dangerous Days as well as the longest strings of Consecutive Dangerous Days. The following pages contain individual state-level reports detailing county-level heat risk, and change in that risk over time, for all 48 states of the Contiguous United States. These details are related to both the relative and absolute heat exposure for properties within those states. Of note, the absolute threshold for heat risk varies between 90°F and 100°F by state, as not all states often reach 100°F. Additionally, the FSF-EHM was not run for AK, HI, or PR.The 6th National Risk Assessment: Hazardous Heat l © First Street Foundation 26 Local Heat Details Alabama What’s considered hot can vary dramatically Top counties: greatest increase in Local Hot Days* from area to area.

How wIll heat affect America The First Street Foundation Extreme Heat Model (FSF-EHM) builds upon open datasets from the US Federal Government, augmented with publicly available and third party data sources, and existing research and expertise on heat modeling. The model estimates localized heat risk at a 30-meter resolution across the United States today and 30 years into the future, creating a high- precision, climate-adjusted heat model that provides insights at a property level. The results indicate that the incidence of extreme heat is growing across the country, both in absolute and relative terms. In absolute terms, the incidence of heat that exceeds the threshold of the National Weather Service’s (NWS) highest category for heat, called “Extreme Danger” (Heat Index above 125°F) is expected to impact about 8 million people this year, increasing to about 107 million people in 2053, an increase of 13 times over 30 years. This increase in “Extreme Danger Days” is concentrated in the middle of the country, in areas where there are no coastal influences to mitigate extreme temperatures.

        "The 6th National Risk Assessment: Hazardous Heat l © First Street Foundation 25 Concluding Remarks The First Street Foundation Extreme Heat Model provides property owners and communities a better understanding of their personal risk to heat in the present and 30 years in the future. Information on heat risk at a high-resolution under current climate conditions as well as in the future allow for better informed decision-making around risk avoidance, adaptation options, and property preparation. Understanding how heat risks change over time under future environmental conditions at a high-resolution is important for property owners, local governments, investors, and other decision makers to undertake the necessary actions for protecting their assets and health, and to price this risk into their decision-making processes. This report highlights how heat risks change in different ways for different regions of the county. California, Texas, and Florida are expected to experience the largest increases in costs, consumption, and CO emissions associated with air conditioning usage (holding all 2 else constant), which may have important implications when considering energy market summertime capacity. The central and Midwestern regions of the country face the highest probabilities of experiencing Extreme Danger Days, or days exceeding a 125°F heat index. This region’s risk of Extreme Danger Days increases in the future, leading to the emergence of the Extreme Heat Belt. The West Coast of the country has the highest probability of experiencing Consecutive Local Hot Days, or days at or above temperatures which those areas may not be acclimated to. Finally, the Gulf and Southeastern Atlantic will face the greatest number of Dangerous Days as well as the longest strings of Consecutive Dangerous Days. The following pages contain individual state-level reports detailing county-level heat risk, and change in that risk over time, for all 48 states of the Contiguous United States. These details are related to both the relative and absolute heat exposure for properties within those states. Of note, the absolute threshold for heat risk varies between 90°F and 100°F by state, as not all states often reach 100°F. Additionally, the FSF-EHM was not run for AK, HI, or PR.",
