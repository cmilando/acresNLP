New York Natural Heritage Program iiExecutive summary Vulnerability assessments are rapidly becoming an essential tool in climate change adaptation planning. As states revise their Wildlife Action Plans, the need to integrate climate change considerations drives the adoption of vulnerability assessments as critical components. To help meet this need for New York, we calculated the relative vulnerability of 119 of New York’s Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) using NatureServe’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Funding was provided to the New York Natural Heritage Program by New York State Wildlife Grants in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration. We selected species spanning taxonomic groups that we thought 1) might be susceptible to climate change, 2) would be good indicators of vulnerability of species in similar habitats, and 3) would have sufficient data to allow conducting the assessment. The CCVI treats climate-change vulnerability as resulting from two factors: exposure and sensitivity. Direct exposure to climate change is assessed using predictions of future changes in temperature and moisture availability based on averages of global circulation models. Indirect exposure considers predicted sea-level rise, existence of barriers to movement, and effects of alternative energy development. Sensitivity is assessed using a variety of factors, including dispersal capability, known sensitivity to changes in temperature and moisture regime, reliance on interspecific interactions, genetic diversity, and expected phenological shifts with changing climate. Finally, the CCVI incorporates documented and modeled effects on the target species. The output is one of five categories of vulnerability: Extremely Vulnerable, Highly Vulnerable, Moderately Vulnerable, Not Vulnerable/Presumed Stable, or Not Vulnerable/Increase Likely. The CCVI also provides a confidence estimate for the information provided. In New York, species ranged from Highly to Extremely Vulnerable (e.g., frosted elfin, brook floater, tiger salamander) to Presumed Stable (e.g., timber rattlesnake, russet-tipped clubtail, spotted turtle). Nearly all species rated as Highly or Extremely Vulnerable were associated with aquatic or seasonally wet habitats. Mussels emerged as especially vulnerable to climate change, given their low mobility, issues with aquatic connectivity, and reliance on other species for dispersal. The primary factors that drove our assessments included genetic variation, phenological responses, natural and anthropogenic barriers to dispersal, and restriction to specific geological features. Vulnerability was only weakly associated with conservation status. Species at the southern edge of their range in New York might become extirpated from the state. Our results agreed broadly with those from Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Additional species in need of assessment include plants, crayfish, cave obligates, and functional or habitat groups of species. Our assessment makes several key points: 1) aquatic and terrestrial habitat connectivity must be maintained and restored, 2) for some species, stressors other than climate change are more limiting to their viability; 3) for some species, climate change will likely result in their extirpation no matter what management actions are taken; and 4) long-term monitoring is vital to detecting changes in New York’s wildlife populations.

The anticipated effects of climate change on some species include shifting distributions, changes in abundance, delayed or advanced migration events, altered sex ratios, changes in a variety of interspecific interactions, and many more. These kinds of changes have already been seen in a variety of taxa all over the globe (Sala et al. 2000, Schneider and Root 2002, Walther et al. 2002, Parmesan and Yohe 2003, Root et al. 2003, Parmesan and Galbraith 2004, Lawler et al. 2006, Lawler et al. 2009, DeWan et al. 2010, Glick et al. 2011). Although a great deal of attention has been focused on the world’s arctic regions and the tropics, New York and the northeastern U.S. also have been the focus of considerable research and planning in recent years. For example, recent studies have shown shifts in breeding ranges of New York’s birds that are consistent with climate change (Zuckerberg et al. 2010), changes in phenology of multiple taxa in the Shawangunk Mountains (Cook et al. 2008), and shifts in the state’s odonate fauna that appear to be climate related (Corser et al. in preparation, Corser 2010, White et al. 2010). Planning efforts specific to the region have emerged as well. The Northeast Climate Impacts Assessment Team (Frumhoff et al. 2007) released “Confronting Climate Change in the US Northeast,” which summarized the current state of research, modeling, and planning efforts for the region. And Jenkins (2010) outlined a conservation plan for the Adirondacks in the face of climate change. Now, New York is beginning the process of revising its State Wildlife Action Plan. With the first iteration completed in 2005 (NYSDEC 2005), New York qualified for State Wildlife Grants funds and now must revise the plan by 2015. A requirement from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is that states must address climate change in their Plan revision. One planning tool that is increasingly employed for focusing conservation and management attention on appropriate targets is the vulnerability assessment. These assessments typically take the form of models in which the inputs are characteristics of species or ecosystems and the output is a rating of relative vulnerability. These kinds of risk assessments have a long history in wildlife management and conservation (Boyce 1992, Ruggiero et al. 1994, Faith and Walker 1996), but only recently have standardized assessment tools been available for addressing the threat of climate change. Vulnerability assessments may be especially useful to highlight conservation targets that would not have otherwise received attention, or to focus management on species susceptible to an emerging threat like climate change. The Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (2009) has promoted these kinds of assessments as a useful way for states to address climate change in their State Wildlife Action Plan revisions. At what level to focus vulnerability assessments—species or ecosystems—has been a topic of some debate. Paleoecological studies have demonstrated that ecological communities have disassembled and reassembled in different configurations as individual species responded to changing climate in myriad ways (Hunter et al. 1988; Beier and Brost 2010). Indeed, the entire present biota of New York has only existed here for the past 10-12,000 years, so clearly there has been much recent dynamism in its makeup, with species distributions in constant flux, expanding and contracting as (a)biotic conditions have changed. Some in the conservation community have used this presumption to call for a focus on systems rather than species (Beier and Brost 2010, Anderson and Ferree 2010). NatureServe (2008) eloquently made the argument for addressing both: “While conservation is often targeted towards habitats, and there is a need to understand likely changes in ecosystem conditions and processes, we feel strongly that understanding the effects of climate change on New York Natural Heritage Program 1individual species is essential as well, not only to target species conservation efforts, but also to understand and project future changes to community and ecosystem composition and structure.” New York State is funding a similar look at the vulnerability of New York’s habitat types to climate change (H. Galbraith, pers. comm.), and the results herein will be more useful when integrated with that ongoing analysis. Available tools and existing efforts Several tools are now available for assessing the relative vulnerability of species to climate change. The University of Washington (2011) has created a Climate Change Sensitivity Database for species in the Pacific Northwest. It is populated with sensitivity rankings on 10 variables for hundreds of species and allows user-defined weights that drive the calculation of a sensitivity index. The U.S. EPA (2009) has released “A Framework for Categorizing the Relative Vulnerability of Threatened and Endangered Species to Climate Change,” which combines an assessment of baseline vulnerability with climate change vulnerability, with an explicit assessment of confidence. NatureServe’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI; Young et al. 2010) has emerged as an easily applied and objective analysis that many U.S. states have recently adopted. One of its chief strengths is that it is designed to be used in conjunction with NatureServe’s conservation status ranks (S-ranks; Master et al. 2009), which are an existing global standard for assessing conservation status based on rarity, trends, and threats. Another strength lies in its explicit incorporation of scientific uncertainty into the assessment: assessors are free to pick a range of values for each factor, and this uncertainty is quantified in a Confidence score. Finally, an Excel workbook is available to calculate index values and document them permanently. We chose NatureServe’s CCVI as the most appropriate tool to assist wildlife managers in New York with planning for climate change adaptation. We ran the CCVI on 121 species, mainly Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN; NYSDEC 2005), that spanned taxonomic groups and habitat associations. We envision that our results will help highlight species-specific conservation needs previously unrecognized. Further, as New York State revises its list of SGCN, we imagine that vulnerability to climate change could be a criterion that allows some otherwise secure species to be recognized as needing conservation attention. In this document we describe our process and make management recommendations based on the results. Methods Species selection We selected species that we thought 1) might be susceptible to climate change, either directly through climate shifts or indirectly through sea-level rise and alternative energy development (this led to the selection of some species on the edges of their ranges and species in coastal and boreal ecosystems); 2) would be good indicators of other species in their habitat; and/or 3) would have sufficient data to allow conducting an assessment. Further, we looked for a balance across taxonomic groups. While other states (Byers and Norris 2011; Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program 2011) have run the index on plants, our project was funded by State Wildlife Grants and thus focused on Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), which in New York are all animals. A few species not currently listed as SGCN were included, with the thought that should they be highlighted as vulnerable to climate change, they could be added to the list of SGCN in the upcoming revision process. New York Natural Heritage Program 2In consultation with colleagues at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), we selected 119 species for analysis. Note that this total includes the Boreal Chorus Frog as distinct from the Western Chorus Frog, as per Lemmon et al. (2007). Species’ scientific names appear in Tables 2-4 and Appendices B- D. CCVI methodology Here we summarize the CCVI methods and discuss specific items unique to New York. Readers are referred to Young et al. (2010) and Byers and Norris (2011) for a fuller documentation. The CCVI bases its determination of vulnerability to climate change on two main factors: exposure to future projected climate change and sensitivity to climate change (Table 1; Figure 1). Exposure is further subdivided into direct exposure (projected changes in temperature and moisture availability within the species’ range) and indirect exposure (distribution relative to sea level rise, natural and anthropogenic barriers to dispersal, and new land uses aiming to mitigate climate change). It is scored based on the percentage of the species’ range within New York that falls into categories of projected changes temperature or moisture. Projections for the year 2050 were downloaded from The Nature Conservancy’s Climate Wizard (www.climatewizard.org), which uses downscaled climate models from Maurer et al. (2009; Figure 2). Sensitivity to climate change is based on a variety of factors, including dispersal capability; past climate regime (Figure 3) and reliance on specific thermal and hydrological conditions; dependence on disturbance; dependence on snow or ice cover; restriction to certain geological types; reliance on interspecific interactions (e.g., herbivory and predator/prey relationships); genetic variation; and climate-related changes in phenology (Table 1). Each species is scored for each sensitivity factor from “decrease vulnerability” to “greatly increase vulnerability” (or a subset range of these categories), with three to six of these categories available for each factor (Figure 1). Descriptions of each factor and examples of how to score them are available in the spreadsheet to help assessors make choices with scoring. Some factors are optional, but certain numbers of factors in each group must be filled out or the Index score is “Insufficient Evidence.” Documented or modeled responses to climate change from the peer-reviewed literature are incorporated as a final factor (Table 1). These were rarely available for our selected species. The output is one of five categories of vulnerability and one indicating lack of evidence. Definitions, and the abbreviations that are used throughout this document, follow (from Young et al. 2010). Extremely Vulnerable (EV): Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed extremely likely to substantially decrease or disappear by 2050. Highly Vulnerable (HV): Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed likely to decrease significantly by 2050. Moderately Vulnerable (MV): Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed likely to decrease by 2050. Not Vulnerable/Presumed Stable (PS): Available evidence does not suggest that abundance and/or range extent within the geographical area assessed will change (increase/decrease) substantially by 2050. Actual range boundaries may change. Not Vulnerable/Increase Likely (IL): Available evidence suggests that abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed is likely to increase by 2050. Insufficient Evidence (IE): Available information about a species’ vulnerability is inadequate to calculate an Index score. New York Natural Heritage Program 3Table 1. Variables assessed in the CCVI.

Results and discussion Seventy (59%) of the 119 species assessed were determined to be vulnerable (EV, HV, or MV) to climate change (Figure 4). Assessment scores of all species are documented in Appendices B through D. Two Noctuid moths, Sideridis maryx (maroonwing) and Trichoclea artesta (Hairy artesta) were determined to have Insufficient Evidence for assessing vulnerability because of a lack of available information, and are not treated any further here. 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 EV HV MV PS IL IE Figure 4.

All mollusks assessed were determined to be vulnerable, with over 50% of the species assessed rated as Extremely Vulnerable (Figure 5). Similarly, 40% of amphibians were rated as Extremely or Highly Vulnerable. Birds and mammals, on the other hand, were less vulnerable on the whole, with only one bird species and no mammals rated as Extremely Vulnerable or Highly Vulnerable. Nearly 70% of reptiles assessed were rated Presumed Stable or Increase Likely, with only the Bog Turtle (EV) and Mud Turtle (HV) rating higher than Moderately Vulnerable, due to dispersal barriers and their aquatic nature. New York Natural Heritage Program 12100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% Figure 5. Percent of species within seven taxonomic groups in each vulnerability category. See page 3 for index abbreviations. Conservation status and vulnerability to climate change were not perfectly related to one another. Although over 60% of the most imperiled species in the state (rank of S1) were assessed as vulnerable to climate change, over 70% of species ranked as apparently secure in the state (S4) were also assessed as vulnerable (Figure 6). Similarly, apart from the most globally imperiled species, global conservation status rank was unrelated to vulnerability (Figure 7). NatureServe notes that the vulnerability index is intended to be used in conjunction with the conservation status rank, and it is conceivable that certain highly imperiled species might not be threatened primarily by climate change, but by more immediate threats such as habitat destruction, overcollection, or disease unrelated to climate. Nevertheless, only S1 and S2 species were ranked as EV, indicating that the highly restricted ranges of the most imperiled species in NY likely subjects these species to enhanced threats from climate change.

Percent of species within six rounded global conservation status ranks in each vulnerability category. See page 3 for index abbreviations. To determine the factors most important in assessing vulnerability, we built classification trees using the Random Forests (Breiman 2001; Liaw and Wiener 2002) package in R (R Development Core Team 2011), a technique from the field of machine learning. The Random Forests routine is to New York Natural Heritage Program 14 seiceps fo tnecreP IL PS MV HV EV Conservation status rank (state) 100% 90% 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% G1 G2 G3 G4 G5 GU (n = 4) (n = 7) (n = 22) (n = 22) (n = 61) (n = 1) seiceps fo tnecreP IL PS MV HV EV Conservation status rank (global)build thousands of classification and regression trees using bootstrap samples of the data set and predictors. This method can provide multiple solutions for a given problem, making it effective at finding different combinations of factors influencing the dependent variable (in this case, the vulnerability index). We limited our predictor variables to the exposure and sensitivity variables influencing vulnerability (i.e., omitting documented and modeled responses) and imputed (estimated) values recorded as “Unknown,” as the routine does not accept missing data. We ran the Random Forests routine on three variants of the vulnerability index: 1) the index as calculated; 2) the index collapsed into three categories (not vulnerable [increase likely and presumed stable], moderately vulnerable, and highly vulnerable [highly vulnerable and extremely vulnerable]; and 3) the index collapsed into two categories (not vulnerable [increase likely and presumed stable] and vulnerable [moderately vulnerable, highly vulnerable, and extremely vulnerable]). As the results of these analyses were very similar, we report only the results using the full 5-level index. The validation component of the Random Forests routine was highly successful in predicting each species’ assigned vulnerability category, with 86.32% correct classification (Table 5). When vulnerability categories were collapsed, the routine was even more successful, but those results are omitted here for brevity. Genetic factors predisposing species to potential climate change effects were easily the most important in our assessments (Figure 8). Species with reduced genetic variation are less likely to be able to respond to environmental change (e.g., Aitken et al. 2008). When documented and modeled responses were included in earlier analyses (omitted here), they were in the top position. Likely, these factors were so important in part because information on them was limited to <30% of the species (genetic variation, n = 32; genetic bottleneck, n = 36; phenological response, n = 36, documented response, n = 12, modeled response, n = 6) and typically limited to species of already elevated concern and those suspected to be vulnerable to climate change (and therefore a focus of research).

Relative importance (increasing to the right) of 30 variables in classifying species by vulnerability category. See Table 1 and Young et al. (2010) for variable definitions. Barriers to dispersal emerged as one of the most important factors in our assessments, as was also found in West Virginia (Byers and Norris 2011). The composite variable highlighting any barrier to dispersal, whether natural or anthropogenic (“Barrier_any”), was the strongest of these predictors. Restriction to certain geological substrates (“Geological_restriction”) was also a strong predictor, with species reliant on single geological types being assessed as more vulnerable than species occurring on multiple geological types. Several factors expected to influence vulnerability did not emerge as important in our assessment. Climate change exposure as measured by the percent of the species’ range in different categories of increased temperature (“Pct_of_range_warm”; “Pct_of_range_warmer”) and decreased moisture availability (“Pct_of_range_dry”; “Pct_of_range_dryer”; “Pct_of_range_dryest”) did not emerge as important predictors. This is likely because these factors varied little across the state (Figure 2), highlighting a need for finer scale predictions for a greater separation among species at the state scale, or at smaller scales. The position of the species’ range relative to New York (“Range_relation_to_assess_area”) also was not a major factor (Figure 9), although 67% of species on the southern edge of their range in NY were assessed as possibly moving out of the state in the New York Natural Heritage Program 16supplementary Index Notes field (Figure 10). Thus, although the index value might suggest a lack of vulnerability rangewide, within New York many species ranges may shift to the point of extirpation from the state. Similarly, 36% species on the northern edge of their ranges had Index Notes suggesting they might expand their range within NY even though they might have been assessed as not highly vulnerable to climate change (Figure 10). Another surprise was that vulnerability to sea-level rise (“Sea_level”) was relatively unimportant in determining overall vulnerability. This pattern may result from an accident of geography: New York’s coastal areas are also its most southern. The 15 species whose exposure to rising sea levels greatly increased their vulnerability are for the most part restricted to Long Island within NY and eight of these species are on the northern edge of their range there. Ten of the species are birds, which have good movement capabilities and few barriers to dispersal (Young et al. 2010). A total of 28 species were determined to have increased vulnerability from sea-level rise. Comfortingly, the identity of the Assessor (“Assessor”; MDS, JDC, KAP, or ELW) was not a primary factor in the rating. Recognizing that different assessors could interpret data differently and thus score species differently, we met several times as we worked through the index calculator to calibrate our assessments. Further, we all calculated the Index for the moose, and found our results were within one half-step of one another. Future efforts also should take into account potential assessor bias in climate change vulnerability assessments. Admittedly, we are unsure whether our results reflect purely the importance of each variable in arriving at final index values in our particular case, or whether they also reflect unequal and undisclosed weighting of factors in the calculation.

Index notes and vulnerability categories for species on the southern edge (top) and northern edge (bottom) of their range in New York. Comparisons to other states Two other states in the Northeast—Pennsylvania and West Virginia—have recently completed similar analyses to inform their State Wildlife Action Plans. As noted above, the overall results of our assessments were quite similar, with over half of species in each state assessed as vulnerable to climate change. Of course, the proportion of species assessed as vulnerable depends greatly on the species selected for analysis, as conducting the analysis on all species is not possible given New York Natural Heritage Program 18 seiceps fo rebmuN EV HV MV PS Possible response 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 No comment Expand seiceps fo rebmuN EV HV MV PS IL Possible responseconstraints of funding, time, and available information. We aimed to select species we thought might prove vulnerable to climate change, as did Byers and Norris (2011), and most of the species selected were already of conservation concern, so caution should be used in extrapolating these results to all species. Our results broadly agreed with those from Pennsylvania and West Virginia (Table 6). New York and Pennsylvania assessed 12 species in common, while New York and West Virginia had 17 species in common. In the vast majority of cases, the final index values matched exactly or were off by one step (e.g., “Presumed Stable” versus “Moderately Vulnerable”). Differences in index values might result from true differences in vulnerability among states or differences in interpretation of data; a full analysis of these differences is beyond the scope of this report. There were two cases where results differed by more than one step: the small-footed bat and the spatterdock darner (Table 6). The bat was rated most vulnerable in Pennsylvania and least in West Virginia, with our assessment happily in between; assessors differed in their ratings on multiple factors for this species. The darner was rated more vulnerable in its dispersal ability, physiological thermal and hydrological niches, and reliance on specific geological types in West Virginia than in New York; while some of these characteristics may differ across species’ ranges, this seems to be a case of differences between the assessors in their interpretation of the species’ biology.

However, we did find some areas for improvement and some nuances of using the tool that could use further investigation and development. For example, we noted that the CCVI does not allow for climate-induced changes in physiology, although some of these changes could be addressed in the Physiological Thermal Niche field; it was unclear to us where to score species that have evolved within a certain thermal niche but may not be showing a “preference for environments toward the warmer end of the spectrum,” as the field is defined. An example is the Blanding’s turtle, which has temperature- dependent sex determination of its young, and for which warming could substantially tilt sex ratios toward females (Janzen 1994). Altered sex ratios could have serious consequences for population structure, yet we felt the Blanding’s turtle was assessed to be less vulnerable to climate change than it should have been. We found that certain mobile insects, even cold-adapted ones, were assessed as essentially invulnerable to climate change and around 60% of the insects that we ran were Presumed Stable (Figure 5) despite abundant evidence that this taxon is intimately coupled to thermal regimes (Frazier et al. 2006). Among the many taxa currently documented to be shifting their ranges in response to climate change, dragonflies have demonstrated the fastest rates of movement (Hickling et al. 2006) and it is well known that cold adapted glacial relict species are most highly vulnerable to a warming climate (Calosi et al. 2008). Yet the boreal dragonflies of the genus Somatochlora and Williamsonia all scored as Presumed Stable despite the fact that these species have most likely been retreating northward from NY for hundreds, if not thousands of years. We suspect that the lack of dispersal barriers for these mobile ectotherms caused them to score as less vulnerable in the calculator. Similarly, birds, which have high mobility and are good dispersers, nearly always scored low on the vulnerability scale. However, species like the black rail, which occurs in salt marshes that are subject to inundation, may not have suitable habitat to disperse to (especially within New York). Susceptibility to disease, brought on by a warming climate, was one factor that was not addressed in the CCVI but that could cause significant mortality events. Interaction between disease and climate change is a well-accepted hypothesis for the global decline of many amphibians (Pounds et al. 2006, Lips et al. 2008). Northern hibernating bat species are now showing similar declines (Blehert et al. 2009), although no link to climate has yet been made. Similarly, moose populations in the upper Midwest are declining and increased susceptibility to pathogens and parasites in heat stressed animals may be one factor related to this decline (Lenarz et al. 2009). Disease-caused mortality events might be one of the ways in which species ranges contract under changing environmental conditions. As noted on page 16, it would be useful if finer scale climate projections were available, as well as a range of temperature and moisture categories more tailored to the assessment area. In the current version for a state like New York, little variation exists in the values able to be assigned for climate change exposure, thus limiting the role of this set of variables in the overall assessment. These variables did not emerge as important in our assessment, yet we know that the relative degree of exposure to changing temperature and moisture is an important determinant of a species’ likely response. Future versions of the CCVI could allow for user-defined categories based on the scale of data available and the size of the assessment area. Indeed, we are developing finer scale data for New York State and the ability to utilize these data in future CCVI assessments would be very beneficial. We would have preferred if the algorithm used to calculate scores were made more transparent and flexible, much as NatureServe has done for its Element Rank Calculator (NatureServe 2009). Such transparency will allow users to understand the results and the relative weightings of factors. Without this information, we were unable to determine the degree to which our analysis of the New York Natural Heritage Program 20relative importance of factors reflected biological importance versus the weights of each factor in the algorithm. Further, user-defined weights would allow assessors to adjust the importance of factors for their specific situation; this feature is allowed in some similar calculators (e.g., University of Washington 2011). Future assessments and research needs Should New York wish to pursue further species-specific vulnerability assessments, we have some suggestions. We were tasked with assessing 100 species; with input from DEC and TNC we came up with a list of 195 priority species and assessed 119. The additional species for which there was interest in a vulnerability assessment are listed in Appendix E. Beyond this list, other taxonomic groups would make for interesting comparisons. Given the high level of vulnerability identified for aquatic species, running the index on crayfish could prove informative, but we had little data on Malacostracans and NY Natural Heritage tracks few organisms in this Order. At least one northeastern state, West Virginia, has found some crayfish species highly vulnerable to climate change (Byers and Norris 2011). Cave obligates were uniformly assessed as “Presumed Stable” in West Virginia (Byers and Norris 2011) due to the predicted resistance of cave ecosystems to changes in climate, but it would be useful to confirm those findings in New York. And importantly, other states (Byers and Norris 2011; Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program 2011; Young et al. 2009) have assessed vulnerability of plants, and many species have emerged as highly and extremely vulnerable to climate change. Finally, because coastal and marine ecosystems are expected to undergo some of the most dramatic transformations with climate change (Harley et al. 2006), conducting a vulnerability analysis on marine species (and ecosystems) is vital to determine where specifically to focus management attention. Scoring catadromous species like American eel proved challenging as well. NatureServe’s CCVI is not designed for marine species (Young et al. 2010) but perhaps can be adapted or broadened in future versions. As is alluded to above, conducting vulnerability analyses on groups of species could nicely complement assessments of individual species and ecosystems or habitats. Appropriate targets would be functional groups (e.g., decomposers, pollinators), habitat guilds (e.g., cave obligates, marine invertebrates, spring and seep breeders), or biogeographical assemblages (e.g., boreal birds, cold-adapted dragonflies). Important patterns might emerge from such analyses that would be missed through a focus on only the species and ecosystem levels. For example, disparate individual species-level vulnerabilties may point towards the disassembly of a community (McMahon et al. 2009), while similar predicted vulnerabilities may help us understand the vulnerability of a habitat or ecosystem as a whole. A regional, or ecoregional, approach to vulnerability assessment would be valuable given the small size of eastern states; shared ecosystems, species, geological history, and climate regimes; and likely similar responses of species within the region. Further, climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts are likely to be most relevant and successful at regional or ecoregional scales (Mawdsley et al. 2009; Heller and Zavaleta 2009; Frumhoff et al. 2007). NatureServe (Young et al. 2010) notes that although the CCVI is intended to work at a “scale of from the size of a national park or wildlife refuge to a state.... It could be used for a regional analysis in the case of several eastern states....” We highly recommend that this kind of project be conducted for the Northeast. An important corollary benefit of conducting a vulnerability assessment is the identification of information gaps. While we recognize that absolute certainty is not possible in responding to the threat of climate change, we do believe that research into some facets of species’ life histories, ecologies, and behaviors could greatly improve our chances of sustaining New York’s biodiversity: 1) thermal tolerances of mussels in all life stages; 2) phenological responses of many species to changing seasonal temperature and precipitation dynamics (efforts such as the National Phenology New York Natural Heritage Program 21Network [http://www.usanpn.org/] should eventually provide some of these data); 3) genetic variation of many species, especially invertebrates and fish; 4) distribution, natural history, and ecology of many invertebrates (e.g., the Noctuid moths that we did not find enough information about to assess); 5) the degree to which landscape features serve as barriers to low- and moderate- mobility taxa; and 6) modeled responses to climate change (some of which are in progress for the Hudson Valley [T. Howard and M. Schlesinger, NY Natural Heritage Program]). As some of these research needs are met in coming years, the information generated can inform a refined vulnerability assessment. Looking beyond vulnerability assessments: Management and monitoring recommendations Our vulnerability assessment is not a final product, but a means to an end (Glick et al. 2011). A full treatise of management and monitoring needs for New York in the face of climate change is beyond the scope of this report. However, Byers and Norris (2011) and Glick et al. (2011) provide some recommendations that are applicable here and below we make a few additional recommendations based on our results. We hope our results and recommendations will be useful to NYS DEC as it revises its Wildlife Action Plan. The fact that most of the species assessed as Highly or Extremely Vulnerable in our analyses were associated with aquatic or seasonally wet habitats, and the identification of barriers to dispersal as an important component of our vulnerability scores, together highlight the importance of aquatic connectivity in New York’s landscape. Specialists in climate-change adaptation have long argued that maintaining and restoring habitat connectivity is paramount in biodiversity preservation (Mawdsley et al. 2009; Heller and Zavaleta 2009; Byers and Norris 2011). Many aquatic species are blocked from seasonal and migratory movements by dams without suitable aquatic organism passage and inadequately designed and situated culverts (Rahel 2007, Cote et al. 2009), which will further compound potential difficulties for species shifting to more favorable climates. Aquatic connectivity should be considered to accommodate the needs of a broad array of taxa, including rare and vulnerable species, in the design of fish passages and culverts. New York has undergone several planning efforts related to aquatic connectivity (e.g., The Nature Conservancy 2011) and implementation of these plans would be a wise investment in facilitating biodiversity adaptation. Maintaining terrestrial connectivity is just as vital, because species faced with inhospitable climates must move across a landscape of varying suitability to access new suitable habitats (Krosby et al. 2010). This is especially true for rare species restricted to certain geological features (Anderson and Ferree 2010) and we found that geological restriction was an important driver of our vulnerability scores. Another valuable outcome of this procedure is that it allows biologists to ascertain which life- history traits of a particular species are most vulnerable to climate change and further highlights that other factors might pose more immediate threats to certain imperiled species. Two iconic bird species at their extreme southern range margins clearly demonstrate this situation. First, our assessment of the black tern found this bird’s range in NY to be Presumed Stable, thus giving further weight to other causes of imperilment such as the degradation and loss of freshwater marshes. Fortunately, effective management strategies for this species and other associated marshbirds have been demonstrated at WMAs and Wildlife Refuges around the state (New York Natural Heritage Program 2011a). On the other hand, the spruce grouse was found to be Extremely Vulnerable to climate change, suggesting that even despite intensive management to favor it, the population in NY will likely continue to decline under a warming climate. Monitoring will be an essential component of any adaptive management strategy for addressing climate change and other threats to New York’s wildlife (Glick et al. 2011). Broad-scale, long-term monitoring of multiple taxa in an occupancy framework (Manley et al. 2004, Mackenzie et al. 2006) New York Natural Heritage Program 22will help 1) test hypotheses about vulnerability, which are essentially what the CCVI provides; 2) detect unanticipated changes in wildlife populations; 3) identify which stressors in addition to climate change need mitigation; and 4) reveal range shifts and changes in phenology. Long-term monitoring datasets and repeated atlases have already revealed shifts that have been vital in demonstrating wildlife responses to climate change (Parmesan et al. 1999; Hitch and Leberg 2007; Zuckerberg et al. 2010). There is a pressing need to establish a solid baseline of data that will allow us to detect these changes in New York’s wildlife and make the most informed conservation and management decisions in the face of this unprecedented global threat.

New York Natural Heritage Program 35Appendix A: Key to codes used in tables Vulnerability Index Scores EV Extremely Vulnerable: Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed extremely likely to substantially decrease or disappear by 2050. HV Highly Vulnerable: Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed likely to decrease significantly by 2050. MV: Moderately Vulnerable: Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed likely to decrease by 2050. PS: Not Vulnerable/Presumed Stable: Available evidence does not suggest that abundance and/or range extent within the geographical area assessed will change (increase/decrease) substantially by 2050. Actual range boundaries may change. IL: Not Vulnerable/Increase Likely: Available evidence suggests that abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed is likely to increase by 2050. IE: Insufficient Evidence: Available information about a species’ vulnerability is inadequate to calculate an Index score. Individual Risk Factor Scores GI Greatly increase vulnerability Inc Increase vulnerability SI Somewhat increase vulnerability N Neutral SD Somewhat decrease vulnerability Dec Decrease vulnerability U Unknown NatureServe Conservation Status Ranks NY Natural Heritage’s statewide inventory efforts revolve around lists of rare species and all types of natural communities known to occur, or to have historically occurred, in the state. These lists are based on a variety of sources including museum collections, scientific literature, information from state and local government agencies, regional and local experts, and data from neighboring states. Each rare species is assigned a rank based on its rarity and vulnerability. Like all state Natural Heritage Programs, NY Natural Heritage’s ranking system assesses rarity at two geographic scales: global and state. The global rarity rank reflects the status of a species or community throughout its range, whereas the state rarity rank indicates its status within New York. Global ranks are maintained and updated by NatureServe, which coordinates the network of Natural Heritage programs. Both global and state ranks are usually based on the range of the species or community, the number of occurrences, the viability of the occurrences, and the vulnerability of the species or community around the globe or across the state. As new data become available, the ranks may be revised to reflect the most current information. Subspecific taxa are also assigned a taxon rank which indicates the subspecies’ rarity rank throughout its range. New York Natural Heritage Program 36For the most part, global and state ranks follow a straightforward scale of 1 (rarest/most imperiled) to 5 (common/secure), as follows: G1, S1 Critically imperiled because of rarity (5 or fewer occurrences, or few remaining acres or miles of stream) or factors making it especially vulnerable to extinction rangewide (global) or in New York (state) G2, S2 Imperiled because of rarity (6-20 occurrences, or few remaining acres or miles of stream) or factors demonstrably making it very vulnerable to extinction (global) or extirpation from New York (state) G3, S3 Either uncommon or local, typically with 21 to 100 occurrences, limited acreage, or miles of stream rangewide (global) or in New York (state) G4, S4 Apparently secure rangewide (global) or in New York (state) G5, S5 Demonstrably secure, though it may be quite rare in parts of its range Note that combination (or “range”) ranks are possible (e.g., S1S2, S2S3). These ranks reflect uncertainty in the information available such that it could not be determined whether one or the other rank was appropriate. They do not indicate a value in between the two numbers. There are some additional codes: GH, SH Only known historically rangewide (global) or not reported in NY the last 20 years GX, SX Apparently extinct (global) or extirpated from NY (state) GU, SU Lack of information or substantial conflicting information about status or trends makes ranking infeasible at this time SNA A visitor to the state but not a regular occupant (such as a bird or insect migrating through the state), or a species that is predicted to occur in NY but that has not been found. SNR No effort has yet been made to rank the species.

        "Executive summary Vulnerability assessments are rapidly becoming an essential tool in climate change adaptation planning. As states revise their Wildlife Action Plans, the need to integrate climate change considerations drives the adoption of vulnerability assessments as critical components. To help meet this need for New York, we calculated the relative vulnerability of 119 of New York’s Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) using NatureServe’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Funding was provided to the New York Natural Heritage Program by New York State Wildlife Grants in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration. We selected species spanning taxonomic groups that we thought 1) might be susceptible to climate change, 2) would be good indicators of vulnerability of species in similar habitats, and 3) would have sufficient data to allow conducting the assessment. The CCVI treats climate-change vulnerability as resulting from two factors: exposure and sensitivity. Direct exposure to climate change is assessed using predictions of future changes in temperature and moisture availability based on averages of global circulation models. Indirect exposure considers predicted sea-level rise, existence of barriers to movement, and effects of alternative energy development. Sensitivity is assessed using a variety of factors, including dispersal capability, known sensitivity to changes in temperature and moisture regime, reliance on interspecific interactions, genetic diversity, and expected phenological shifts with changing climate. Finally, the CCVI incorporates documented and modeled effects on the target species. The output is one of five categories of vulnerability: Extremely Vulnerable, Highly Vulnerable, Moderately Vulnerable, Not Vulnerable/Presumed Stable, or Not Vulnerable/Increase Likely. The CCVI also provides a confidence estimate for the information provided. In New York, species ranged from Highly to Extremely Vulnerable (e.g., frosted elfin, brook floater, tiger salamander) to Presumed Stable (e.g., timber rattlesnake, russet-tipped clubtail, spotted turtle). Nearly all species rated as Highly or Extremely Vulnerable were associated with aquatic or seasonally wet habitats. Mussels emerged as especially vulnerable to climate change, given their low mobility, issues with aquatic connectivity, and reliance on other species for dispersal. The primary factors that drove our assessments included genetic variation, phenological responses, natural and anthropogenic barriers to dispersal, and restriction to specific geological features. Vulnerability was only weakly associated with conservation status. Species at the southern edge of their range in New York might become extirpated from the state. Our results agreed broadly with those from Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Additional species in need of assessment include plants, crayfish, cave obligates, and functional or habitat groups of species. Our assessment makes several key points: 1) aquatic and terrestrial habitat connectivity must be maintained and restored, 2) for some species, stressors other than climate change are more limiting to their viability; 3) for some species, climate change will likely result in their extirpation no matter what management actions are taken; and 4) long-term monitoring is vital to detecting changes in New York’s wildlife populations.

        "Introduction Background and justification Polar bears may be the most charismatic and well known animal facing imminent threats from our changing climate, but the ramifications of warming, drought, flooding, and intense storms will be felt throughout the animal kingdom. The anticipated effects of climate change on some species include shifting distributions, changes in abundance, delayed or advanced migration events, altered sex ratios, changes in a variety of interspecific interactions, and many more. These kinds of changes have already been seen in a variety of taxa all over the globe (Sala et al. 2000, Schneider and Root 2002, Walther et al. 2002, Parmesan and Yohe 2003, Root et al. 2003, Parmesan and Galbraith 2004, Lawler et al. 2006, Lawler et al. 2009, DeWan et al. 2010, Glick et al. 2011). Although a great deal of attention has been focused on the world’s arctic regions and the tropics, New York and the northeastern U.S. also have been the focus of considerable research and planning in recent years. For example, recent studies have shown shifts in breeding ranges of New York’s birds that are consistent with climate change (Zuckerberg et al. 2010), changes in phenology of multiple taxa in the Shawangunk Mountains (Cook et al. 2008), and shifts in the state’s odonate fauna that appear to be climate related (Corser et al. in preparation, Corser 2010, White et al. 2010). Planning efforts specific to the region have emerged as well. The Northeast Climate Impacts Assessment Team (Frumhoff et al. 2007) released “Confronting Climate Change in the US Northeast,” which summarized the current state of research, modeling, and planning efforts for the region. And Jenkins (2010) outlined a conservation plan for the Adirondacks in the face of climate change. Now, New York is beginning the process of revising its State Wildlife Action Plan. With the first iteration completed in 2005 (NYSDEC 2005), New York qualified for State Wildlife Grants funds and now must revise the plan by 2015. A requirement from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is that states must address climate change in their Plan revision. One planning tool that is increasingly employed for focusing conservation and management attention on appropriate targets is the vulnerability assessment. These assessments typically take the form of models in which the inputs are characteristics of species or ecosystems and the output is a rating of relative vulnerability. These kinds of risk assessments have a long history in wildlife management and conservation (Boyce 1992, Ruggiero et al. 1994, Faith and Walker 1996), but only recently have standardized assessment tools been available for addressing the threat of climate change. Vulnerability assessments may be especially useful to highlight conservation targets that would not have otherwise received attention, or to focus management on species susceptible to an emerging threat like climate change. The Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (2009) has promoted these kinds of assessments as a useful way for states to address climate change in their State Wildlife Action Plan revisions. At what level to focus vulnerability assessments—species or ecosystems—has been a topic of some debate. Paleoecological studies have demonstrated that ecological communities have disassembled and reassembled in different configurations as individual species responded to changing climate in myriad ways (Hunter et al. 1988; Beier and Brost 2010). Indeed, the entire present biota of New York has only existed here for the past 10-12,000 years, so clearly there has been much recent dynamism in its makeup, with species distributions in constant flux, expanding and contracting as (a)biotic conditions have changed. Some in the conservation community have used this presumption to call for a focus on systems rather than species (Beier and Brost 2010, Anderson and Ferree 2010). NatureServe (2008) eloquently made the argument for addressing both: “While conservation is often targeted towards habitats, and there is a need to understand likely changes in ecosystem conditions and processes, we feel strongly that understanding the effects of climate change on New York Natural Heritage Program 1",
        "individual species is essential as well, not only to target species conservation efforts, but also to understand and project future changes to community and ecosystem composition and structure.” New York State is funding a similar look at the vulnerability of New York’s habitat types to climate change (H. Galbraith, pers. comm.), and the results herein will be more useful when integrated with that ongoing analysis. Available tools and existing efforts Several tools are now available for assessing the relative vulnerability of species to climate change. The University of Washington (2011) has created a Climate Change Sensitivity Database for species in the Pacific Northwest. It is populated with sensitivity rankings on 10 variables for hundreds of species and allows user-defined weights that drive the calculation of a sensitivity index. The U.S. EPA (2009) has released “A Framework for Categorizing the Relative Vulnerability of Threatened and Endangered Species to Climate Change,” which combines an assessment of baseline vulnerability with climate change vulnerability, with an explicit assessment of confidence. NatureServe’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI; Young et al. 2010) has emerged as an easily applied and objective analysis that many U.S. states have recently adopted. One of its chief strengths is that it is designed to be used in conjunction with NatureServe’s conservation status ranks (S-ranks; Master et al. 2009), which are an existing global standard for assessing conservation status based on rarity, trends, and threats. Another strength lies in its explicit incorporation of scientific uncertainty into the assessment: assessors are free to pick a range of values for each factor, and this uncertainty is quantified in a Confidence score. Finally, an Excel workbook is available to calculate index values and document them permanently. We chose NatureServe’s CCVI as the most appropriate tool to assist wildlife managers in New York with planning for climate change adaptation. We ran the CCVI on 121 species, mainly Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN; NYSDEC 2005), that spanned taxonomic groups and habitat associations. We envision that our results will help highlight species-specific conservation needs previously unrecognized. Further, as New York State revises its list of SGCN, we imagine that vulnerability to climate change could be a criterion that allows some otherwise secure species to be recognized as needing conservation attention. In this document we describe our process and make management recommendations based on the results. Methods Species selection We selected species that we thought 1) might be susceptible to climate change, either directly through climate shifts or indirectly through sea-level rise and alternative energy development (this led to the selection of some species on the edges of their ranges and species in coastal and boreal ecosystems); 2) would be good indicators of other species in their habitat; and/or 3) would have sufficient data to allow conducting an assessment. Further, we looked for a balance across taxonomic groups. While other states (Byers and Norris 2011; Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program 2011) have run the index on plants, our project was funded by State Wildlife Grants and thus focused on Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), which in New York are all animals. A few species not currently listed as SGCN were included, with the thought that should they be highlighted as vulnerable to climate change, they could be added to the list of SGCN in the upcoming revision process.

        "In consultation with colleagues at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), we selected 119 species for analysis. Note that this total includes the Boreal Chorus Frog as distinct from the Western Chorus Frog, as per Lemmon et al. (2007). Species’ scientific names appear in Tables 2-4 and Appendices B- D. CCVI methodology Here we summarize the CCVI methods and discuss specific items unique to New York. Readers are referred to Young et al. (2010) and Byers and Norris (2011) for a fuller documentation. The CCVI bases its determination of vulnerability to climate change on two main factors: exposure to future projected climate change and sensitivity to climate change (Table 1; Figure 1). Exposure is further subdivided into direct exposure (projected changes in temperature and moisture availability within the species’ range) and indirect exposure (distribution relative to sea level rise, natural and anthropogenic barriers to dispersal, and new land uses aiming to mitigate climate change). It is scored based on the percentage of the species’ range within New York that falls into categories of projected changes temperature or moisture. Projections for the year 2050 were downloaded from The Nature Conservancy’s Climate Wizard (www.climatewizard.org), which uses downscaled climate models from Maurer et al. (2009; Figure 2). Sensitivity to climate change is based on a variety of factors, including dispersal capability; past climate regime (Figure 3) and reliance on specific thermal and hydrological conditions; dependence on disturbance; dependence on snow or ice cover; restriction to certain geological types; reliance on interspecific interactions (e.g., herbivory and predator/prey relationships); genetic variation; and climate-related changes in phenology (Table 1). Each species is scored for each sensitivity factor from “decrease vulnerability” to “greatly increase vulnerability” (or a subset range of these categories), with three to six of these categories available for each factor (Figure 1). Descriptions of each factor and examples of how to score them are available in the spreadsheet to help assessors make choices with scoring. Some factors are optional, but certain numbers of factors in each group must be filled out or the Index score is “Insufficient Evidence.” Documented or modeled responses to climate change from the peer-reviewed literature are incorporated as a final factor (Table 1). These were rarely available for our selected species. The output is one of five categories of vulnerability and one indicating lack of evidence. Definitions, and the abbreviations that are used throughout this document, follow (from Young et al. 2010). Extremely Vulnerable (EV): Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed extremely likely to substantially decrease or disappear by 2050. Highly Vulnerable (HV): Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed likely to decrease significantly by 2050. Moderately Vulnerable (MV): Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed likely to decrease by 2050. Not Vulnerable/Presumed Stable (PS): Available evidence does not suggest that abundance and/or range extent within the geographical area assessed will change (increase/decrease) substantially by 2050. Actual range boundaries may change. Not Vulnerable/Increase Likely (IL): Available evidence suggests that abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed is likely to increase by 2050. Insufficient Evidence (IE): Available information about a species’ vulnerability is inadequate to calculate an Index score. New York Natural Heritage Program 3",

NatureServe notes that the vulnerability index is intended to be used in conjunction with the conservation status rank, and it is conceivable that certain highly imperiled species might not be threatened primarily by climate change, but by more immediate threats such as habitat destruction, overcollection, or disease unrelated to climate.

        "build thousands of classification and regression trees using bootstrap samples of the data set and predictors. This method can provide multiple solutions for a given problem, making it effective at finding different combinations of factors influencing the dependent variable (in this case, the vulnerability index). We limited our predictor variables to the exposure and sensitivity variables influencing vulnerability (i.e., omitting documented and modeled responses) and imputed (estimated) values recorded as “Unknown,” as the routine does not accept missing data. We ran the Random Forests routine on three variants of the vulnerability index: 1) the index as calculated; 2) the index collapsed into three categories (not vulnerable [increase likely and presumed stable], moderately vulnerable, and highly vulnerable [highly vulnerable and extremely vulnerable]; and 3) the index collapsed into two categories (not vulnerable [increase likely and presumed stable] and vulnerable [moderately vulnerable, highly vulnerable, and extremely vulnerable]). As the results of these analyses were very similar, we report only the results using the full 5-level index. The validation component of the Random Forests routine was highly successful in predicting each species’ assigned vulnerability category, with 86.32% correct classification (Table 5). When vulnerability categories were collapsed, the routine was even more successful, but those results are omitted here for brevity. Genetic factors predisposing species to potential climate change effects were easily the most important in our assessments (Figure 8). Species with reduced genetic variation are less likely to be able to respond to environmental change (e.g., Aitken et al. 2008). When documented and modeled responses were included in earlier analyses (omitted here), they were in the top position. Likely, these factors were so important in part because information on them was limited to <30% of the species (genetic variation, n = 32; genetic bottleneck, n = 36; phenological response, n = 36, documented response, n = 12, modeled response, n = 6) and typically limited to species of already elevated concern and those suspected to be vulnerable to climate change (and therefore a focus of research).

        "Figure 8. Relative importance (increasing to the right) of 30 variables in classifying species by vulnerability category. See Table 1 and Young et al. (2010) for variable definitions. Barriers to dispersal emerged as one of the most important factors in our assessments, as was also found in West Virginia (Byers and Norris 2011). The composite variable highlighting any barrier to dispersal, whether natural or anthropogenic (“Barrier_any”), was the strongest of these predictors. Restriction to certain geological substrates (“Geological_restriction”) was also a strong predictor, with species reliant on single geological types being assessed as more vulnerable than species occurring on multiple geological types. Several factors expected to influence vulnerability did not emerge as important in our assessment. Climate change exposure as measured by the percent of the species’ range in different categories of increased temperature (“Pct_of_range_warm”; “Pct_of_range_warmer”) and decreased moisture availability (“Pct_of_range_dry”; “Pct_of_range_dryer”; “Pct_of_range_dryest”) did not emerge as important predictors. This is likely because these factors varied little across the state (Figure 2), highlighting a need for finer scale predictions for a greater separation among species at the state scale, or at smaller scales. The position of the species’ range relative to New York (“Range_relation_to_assess_area”) also was not a major factor (Figure 9), although 67% of species on the southern edge of their range in NY were assessed as possibly moving out of the state in the New York Natural Heritage Program 16",
        "supplementary Index Notes field (Figure 10). Thus, although the index value might suggest a lack of vulnerability rangewide, within New York many species ranges may shift to the point of extirpation from the state. Similarly, 36% species on the northern edge of their ranges had Index Notes suggesting they might expand their range within NY even though they might have been assessed as not highly vulnerable to climate change (Figure 10). Another surprise was that vulnerability to sea-level rise (“Sea_level”) was relatively unimportant in determining overall vulnerability. This pattern may result from an accident of geography: New York’s coastal areas are also its most southern. The 15 species whose exposure to rising sea levels greatly increased their vulnerability are for the most part restricted to Long Island within NY and eight of these species are on the northern edge of their range there. Ten of the species are birds, which have good movement capabilities and few barriers to dispersal (Young et al. 2010). A total of 28 species were determined to have increased vulnerability from sea-level rise. Comfortingly, the identity of the Assessor (“Assessor”; MDS, JDC, KAP, or ELW) was not a primary factor in the rating. Recognizing that different assessors could interpret data differently and thus score species differently, we met several times as we worked through the index calculator to calibrate our assessments. Further, we all calculated the Index for the moose, and found our results were within one half-step of one another. Future efforts also should take into account potential assessor bias in climate change vulnerability assessments. Admittedly, we are unsure whether our results reflect purely the importance of each variable in arriving at final index values in our particular case, or whether they also reflect unequal and undisclosed weighting of factors in the calculation.

        "constraints of funding, time, and available information. We aimed to select species we thought might prove vulnerable to climate change, as did Byers and Norris (2011), and most of the species selected were already of conservation concern, so caution should be used in extrapolating these results to all species. Our results broadly agreed with those from Pennsylvania and West Virginia (Table 6). New York and Pennsylvania assessed 12 species in common, while New York and West Virginia had 17 species in common. In the vast majority of cases, the final index values matched exactly or were off by one step (e.g., “Presumed Stable” versus “Moderately Vulnerable”). Differences in index values might result from true differences in vulnerability among states or differences in interpretation of data; a full analysis of these differences is beyond the scope of this report. There were two cases where results differed by more than one step: the small-footed bat and the spatterdock darner (Table 6). The bat was rated most vulnerable in Pennsylvania and least in West Virginia, with our assessment happily in between; assessors differed in their ratings on multiple factors for this species. The darner was rated more vulnerable in its dispersal ability, physiological thermal and hydrological niches, and reliance on specific geological types in West Virginia than in New York; while some of these characteristics may differ across species’ ranges, this seems to be a case of differences between the assessors in their interpretation of the species’ biology.

        "Suggestions for further development of the CCVI On the whole, we found the CCVI easy and efficient to use (most species took an hour or less) and well documented, and it generally yielded results that made sense to us. However, we did find some areas for improvement and some nuances of using the tool that could use further investigation and development. For example, we noted that the CCVI does not allow for climate-induced changes in physiology, although some of these changes could be addressed in the Physiological Thermal Niche field; it was unclear to us where to score species that have evolved within a certain thermal niche but may not be showing a “preference for environments toward the warmer end of the spectrum,” as the field is defined. An example is the Blanding’s turtle, which has temperature- dependent sex determination of its young, and for which warming could substantially tilt sex ratios toward females (Janzen 1994). Altered sex ratios could have serious consequences for population structure, yet we felt the Blanding’s turtle was assessed to be less vulnerable to climate change than it should have been. We found that certain mobile insects, even cold-adapted ones, were assessed as essentially invulnerable to climate change and around 60% of the insects that we ran were Presumed Stable (Figure 5) despite abundant evidence that this taxon is intimately coupled to thermal regimes (Frazier et al. 2006). Among the many taxa currently documented to be shifting their ranges in response to climate change, dragonflies have demonstrated the fastest rates of movement (Hickling et al. 2006) and it is well known that cold adapted glacial relict species are most highly vulnerable to a warming climate (Calosi et al. 2008). Yet the boreal dragonflies of the genus Somatochlora and Williamsonia all scored as Presumed Stable despite the fact that these species have most likely been retreating northward from NY for hundreds, if not thousands of years. We suspect that the lack of dispersal barriers for these mobile ectotherms caused them to score as less vulnerable in the calculator. Similarly, birds, which have high mobility and are good dispersers, nearly always scored low on the vulnerability scale. However, species like the black rail, which occurs in salt marshes that are subject to inundation, may not have suitable habitat to disperse to (especially within New York). Susceptibility to disease, brought on by a warming climate, was one factor that was not addressed in the CCVI but that could cause significant mortality events. Interaction between disease and climate change is a well-accepted hypothesis for the global decline of many amphibians (Pounds et al. 2006, Lips et al. 2008). Northern hibernating bat species are now showing similar declines (Blehert et al. 2009), although no link to climate has yet been made. Similarly, moose populations in the upper Midwest are declining and increased susceptibility to pathogens and parasites in heat stressed animals may be one factor related to this decline (Lenarz et al. 2009). Disease-caused mortality events might be one of the ways in which species ranges contract under changing environmental conditions. As noted on page 16, it would be useful if finer scale climate projections were available, as well as a range of temperature and moisture categories more tailored to the assessment area. In the current version for a state like New York, little variation exists in the values able to be assigned for climate change exposure, thus limiting the role of this set of variables in the overall assessment. These variables did not emerge as important in our assessment, yet we know that the relative degree of exposure to changing temperature and moisture is an important determinant of a species’ likely response. Future versions of the CCVI could allow for user-defined categories based on the scale of data available and the size of the assessment area. Indeed, we are developing finer scale data for New York State and the ability to utilize these data in future CCVI assessments would be very beneficial. We would have preferred if the algorithm used to calculate scores were made more transparent and flexible, much as NatureServe has done for its Element Rank Calculator (NatureServe 2009). Such transparency will allow users to understand the results and the relative weightings of factors. Without this information, we were unable to determine the degree to which our analysis of the New York Natural Heritage Program 20",
        "relative importance of factors reflected biological importance versus the weights of each factor in the algorithm. Further, user-defined weights would allow assessors to adjust the importance of factors for their specific situation; this feature is allowed in some similar calculators (e.g., University of Washington 2011). Future assessments and research needs Should New York wish to pursue further species-specific vulnerability assessments, we have some suggestions. We were tasked with assessing 100 species; with input from DEC and TNC we came up with a list of 195 priority species and assessed 119. The additional species for which there was interest in a vulnerability assessment are listed in Appendix E. Beyond this list, other taxonomic groups would make for interesting comparisons. Given the high level of vulnerability identified for aquatic species, running the index on crayfish could prove informative, but we had little data on Malacostracans and NY Natural Heritage tracks few organisms in this Order. At least one northeastern state, West Virginia, has found some crayfish species highly vulnerable to climate change (Byers and Norris 2011). Cave obligates were uniformly assessed as “Presumed Stable” in West Virginia (Byers and Norris 2011) due to the predicted resistance of cave ecosystems to changes in climate, but it would be useful to confirm those findings in New York. And importantly, other states (Byers and Norris 2011; Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program 2011; Young et al. 2009) have assessed vulnerability of plants, and many species have emerged as highly and extremely vulnerable to climate change. Finally, because coastal and marine ecosystems are expected to undergo some of the most dramatic transformations with climate change (Harley et al. 2006), conducting a vulnerability analysis on marine species (and ecosystems) is vital to determine where specifically to focus management attention. Scoring catadromous species like American eel proved challenging as well. NatureServe’s CCVI is not designed for marine species (Young et al. 2010) but perhaps can be adapted or broadened in future versions. As is alluded to above, conducting vulnerability analyses on groups of species could nicely complement assessments of individual species and ecosystems or habitats. Appropriate targets would be functional groups (e.g., decomposers, pollinators), habitat guilds (e.g., cave obligates, marine invertebrates, spring and seep breeders), or biogeographical assemblages (e.g., boreal birds, cold-adapted dragonflies). Important patterns might emerge from such analyses that would be missed through a focus on only the species and ecosystem levels. For example, disparate individual species-level vulnerabilties may point towards the disassembly of a community (McMahon et al. 2009), while similar predicted vulnerabilities may help us understand the vulnerability of a habitat or ecosystem as a whole. A regional, or ecoregional, approach to vulnerability assessment would be valuable given the small size of eastern states; shared ecosystems, species, geological history, and climate regimes; and likely similar responses of species within the region. Further, climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts are likely to be most relevant and successful at regional or ecoregional scales (Mawdsley et al. 2009; Heller and Zavaleta 2009; Frumhoff et al. 2007). NatureServe (Young et al. 2010) notes that although the CCVI is intended to work at a “scale of from the size of a national park or wildlife refuge to a state.... It could be used for a regional analysis in the case of several eastern states....” We highly recommend that this kind of project be conducted for the Northeast. An important corollary benefit of conducting a vulnerability assessment is the identification of information gaps. While we recognize that absolute certainty is not possible in responding to the threat of climate change, we do believe that research into some facets of species’ life histories, ecologies, and behaviors could greatly improve our chances of sustaining New York’s biodiversity: 1) thermal tolerances of mussels in all life stages; 2) phenological responses of many species to changing seasonal temperature and precipitation dynamics (efforts such as the National Phenology New York Natural Heritage Program 21",
        "Network [http://www.usanpn.org/] should eventually provide some of these data); 3) genetic variation of many species, especially invertebrates and fish; 4) distribution, natural history, and ecology of many invertebrates (e.g., the Noctuid moths that we did not find enough information about to assess); 5) the degree to which landscape features serve as barriers to low- and moderate- mobility taxa; and 6) modeled responses to climate change (some of which are in progress for the Hudson Valley [T. Howard and M. Schlesinger, NY Natural Heritage Program]). As some of these research needs are met in coming years, the information generated can inform a refined vulnerability assessment. Looking beyond vulnerability assessments: Management and monitoring recommendations Our vulnerability assessment is not a final product, but a means to an end (Glick et al. 2011). A full treatise of management and monitoring needs for New York in the face of climate change is beyond the scope of this report. However, Byers and Norris (2011) and Glick et al. (2011) provide some recommendations that are applicable here and below we make a few additional recommendations based on our results. We hope our results and recommendations will be useful to NYS DEC as it revises its Wildlife Action Plan. The fact that most of the species assessed as Highly or Extremely Vulnerable in our analyses were associated with aquatic or seasonally wet habitats, and the identification of barriers to dispersal as an important component of our vulnerability scores, together highlight the importance of aquatic connectivity in New York’s landscape. Specialists in climate-change adaptation have long argued that maintaining and restoring habitat connectivity is paramount in biodiversity preservation (Mawdsley et al. 2009; Heller and Zavaleta 2009; Byers and Norris 2011). Many aquatic species are blocked from seasonal and migratory movements by dams without suitable aquatic organism passage and inadequately designed and situated culverts (Rahel 2007, Cote et al. 2009), which will further compound potential difficulties for species shifting to more favorable climates. Aquatic connectivity should be considered to accommodate the needs of a broad array of taxa, including rare and vulnerable species, in the design of fish passages and culverts. New York has undergone several planning efforts related to aquatic connectivity (e.g., The Nature Conservancy 2011) and implementation of these plans would be a wise investment in facilitating biodiversity adaptation. Maintaining terrestrial connectivity is just as vital, because species faced with inhospitable climates must move across a landscape of varying suitability to access new suitable habitats (Krosby et al. 2010). This is especially true for rare species restricted to certain geological features (Anderson and Ferree 2010) and we found that geological restriction was an important driver of our vulnerability scores. Another valuable outcome of this procedure is that it allows biologists to ascertain which life- history traits of a particular species are most vulnerable to climate change and further highlights that other factors might pose more immediate threats to certain imperiled species. Two iconic bird species at their extreme southern range margins clearly demonstrate this situation. First, our assessment of the black tern found this bird’s range in NY to be Presumed Stable, thus giving further weight to other causes of imperilment such as the degradation and loss of freshwater marshes. Fortunately, effective management strategies for this species and other associated marshbirds have been demonstrated at WMAs and Wildlife Refuges around the state (New York Natural Heritage Program 2011a). On the other hand, the spruce grouse was found to be Extremely Vulnerable to climate change, suggesting that even despite intensive management to favor it, the population in NY will likely continue to decline under a warming climate. Monitoring will be an essential component of any adaptive management strategy for addressing climate change and other threats to New York’s wildlife (Glick et al. 2011). Broad-scale, long-term monitoring of multiple taxa in an occupancy framework (Manley et al. 2004, Mackenzie et al. 2006) New York Natural Heritage Program 22",
        "will help 1) test hypotheses about vulnerability, which are essentially what the CCVI provides; 2) detect unanticipated changes in wildlife populations; 3) identify which stressors in addition to climate change need mitigation; and 4) reveal range shifts and changes in phenology. Long-term monitoring datasets and repeated atlases have already revealed shifts that have been vital in demonstrating wildlife responses to climate change (Parmesan et al. 1999; Hitch and Leberg 2007; Zuckerberg et al. 2010). There is a pressing need to establish a solid baseline of data that will allow us to detect these changes in New York’s wildlife and make the most informed conservation and management decisions in the face of this unprecedented global threat.

        "Appendix A: Key to codes used in tables Vulnerability Index Scores EV Extremely Vulnerable: Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed extremely likely to substantially decrease or disappear by 2050. HV Highly Vulnerable: Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed likely to decrease significantly by 2050. MV: Moderately Vulnerable: Abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed likely to decrease by 2050. PS: Not Vulnerable/Presumed Stable: Available evidence does not suggest that abundance and/or range extent within the geographical area assessed will change (increase/decrease) substantially by 2050. Actual range boundaries may change. IL: Not Vulnerable/Increase Likely: Available evidence suggests that abundance and/or range extent within geographical area assessed is likely to increase by 2050. IE: Insufficient Evidence: Available information about a species’ vulnerability is inadequate to calculate an Index score. Individual Risk Factor Scores GI Greatly increase vulnerability Inc Increase vulnerability SI Somewhat increase vulnerability N Neutral SD Somewhat decrease vulnerability Dec Decrease vulnerability U Unknown NatureServe Conservation Status Ranks NY Natural Heritage’s statewide inventory efforts revolve around lists of rare species and all types of natural communities known to occur, or to have historically occurred, in the state. These lists are based on a variety of sources including museum collections, scientific literature, information from state and local government agencies, regional and local experts, and data from neighboring states. Each rare species is assigned a rank based on its rarity and vulnerability. Like all state Natural Heritage Programs, NY Natural Heritage’s ranking system assesses rarity at two geographic scales: global and state. The global rarity rank reflects the status of a species or community throughout its range, whereas the state rarity rank indicates its status within New York. Global ranks are maintained and updated by NatureServe, which coordinates the network of Natural Heritage programs. Both global and state ranks are usually based on the range of the species or community, the number of occurrences, the viability of the occurrences, and the vulnerability of the species or community around the globe or across the state. As new data become available, the ranks may be revised to reflect the most current information. Subspecific taxa are also assigned a taxon rank which indicates the subspecies’ rarity rank throughout its range. New York Natural Heritage Program 36",
        "For the most part, global and state ranks follow a straightforward scale of 1 (rarest/most imperiled) to 5 (common/secure), as follows: G1, S1 Critically imperiled because of rarity (5 or fewer occurrences, or few remaining acres or miles of stream) or factors making it especially vulnerable to extinction rangewide (global) or in New York (state) G2, S2 Imperiled because of rarity (6-20 occurrences, or few remaining acres or miles of stream) or factors demonstrably making it very vulnerable to extinction (global) or extirpation from New York (state) G3, S3 Either uncommon or local, typically with 21 to 100 occurrences, limited acreage, or miles of stream rangewide (global) or in New York (state) G4, S4 Apparently secure rangewide (global) or in New York (state) G5, S5 Demonstrably secure, though it may be quite rare in parts of its range Note that combination (or “range”) ranks are possible (e.g., S1S2, S2S3). These ranks reflect uncertainty in the information available such that it could not be determined whether one or the other rank was appropriate. They do not indicate a value in between the two numbers. There are some additional codes: GH, SH Only known historically rangewide (global) or not reported in NY the last 20 years GX, SX Apparently extinct (global) or extirpated from NY (state) GU, SU Lack of information or substantial conflicting information about status or trends makes ranking infeasible at this time SNA A visitor to the state but not a regular occupant (such as a bird or insect migrating through the state), or a species that is predicted to occur in NY but that has not been found. SNR No effort has yet been made to rank the species. New York Natural Heritage Program 37",
