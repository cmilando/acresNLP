Hazard mitigation breaks the repetitive cycle of disaster damage, recovery, and repeated disaster damage. Hazard mitigation planning reduces the loss of life and property by minimizing the impacts of disasters. It is a proactive effort to identify actions that communities can take to reduce the dangers to life and property from natural hazard events. Mitigation plans are critical to breaking the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction by developing long-term strategies to protect life, property, and the environment from natural disasters. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) requires all municipalities to adopt a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-approved local multi-hazard mitigation plan to be eligible for Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) funding. Pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) – 44 § 201.6 (d) (3), a local jurisdiction must review and revise its plan to reflect changes in development, progress in local mitigation efforts, and changes in priorities and resubmit every five years in order to continue to be eligible for mitigation project grant funding. The City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan – 2022 Update (hereafter, 2022 Update) was completed in accordance with 44 CFR § 201.6 (d) (3). Planning Process Planning for the 2022 Update was led by the Revere Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee (hereafter, Planning Committee), composed of staff from several different City Departments. The Planning Committee discussed where the impacts of natural hazards most affect the City, goals for addressing these impacts, and hazard mitigation measures that would benefit the City. The following two Local Hazard Planning Committee Meetings were held to support the 2022 Update: • Local Hazard Planning Committee Meeting #1, January 20, 2021. • Local Hazard Planning Committee Meeting #2, April 27, 2021. The following two Public Stakeholder Meetings were held to support the 2022 Update: • Public Stakeholder Meeting #1, March 3, 2021. • Public Stakeholder Meeting #2, October 7, 2021. Risk Assessment The Risk Assessment includes a description of the type, location, and extent of all-natural hazards that can affect Revere. New to the 2022 Update is the organization of natural hazards through the following climate change interactions: changes in precipitation, sea level rise, rising temperatures, and extreme weather, in addition to non-climate influenced hazards. The 2022 Update provides risk assessment for the following natural hazards in Revere, outlined by climate change interaction: Changes in Precipitation • Inland Flooding • Drought • Landslides AECOM ES-1Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Sea Level Rise • Coastal Flooding • Coastal Erosion • Tsunamis Rising Temperatures • Hurricanes/Tropical Storms • Severe Winter Storms • Tornadoes In addition, the Risk Assessment profiles earthquakes, which are considered a non-climate influenced hazard. Hazard Mitigation Strategy The Hazard Mitigation Strategy provides the City’s blueprint for reducing the potential losses identified in the risk assessment, based on existing authorities, policies, programs, and resources, and its ability to expand on and improve existing tools. Hazard Mitigation Goals and Actions, listed below, form the basis of the mitigation strategy. Hazard Mitigation Goals 1) Ensure that critical infrastructure sites are protected from natural hazards. 2) Protect existing residential and business areas from flooding. 3) Make efficient use of public funds for hazard mitigation. 4) Continue to enforce existing zoning and building regulations. 5) Educate the public about zoning and building regulations, particularly about changes in regulations that may affect tear downs and new construction. 6) Encourage future development in areas that are not prone to natural hazards. 7) Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures. 8) Protect the City’s ability to respond to various natural hazard events. Plan Adoption and Maintenance The process for reviewing and updating Revere’s Hazard Mitigation Plan is summarized in Table ES-1. AECOM ES-2Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Table ES-1: Plan Review and Update Chapter Reviews and Updates 2 Planning An active stakeholder engagement and public involvement process is critical to developing or Process updating a hazard mitigation plan. The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee was established to lead the planning process for the 2022 Update. The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee encompasses an interdisciplinary group of stakeholders from the City, and includes representation from first responders and emergency managers, planning and development, engineers and infrastructure operators, and the City’s school department. 3 Risk The Planning Committee gathered the most recently available hazard and land use data and met Assessment with City staff to identify changes in local hazard areas and development trends. City staff reviewed critical infrastructure to create an up-to-date list. 4 Hazard The Hazard Mitigation Strategy, comprised of goals and actions, were reviewed during the Mitigation planning process, and endorsed by the Planning Committee. Mitigation measures from the 2015 Strategy Update were reviewed and assessed as to whether they were completed, on-going, or deferred. The Planning Committee determined whether to carry forward measures into the 2015 Update or delete them. The Hazard Mitigation Strategy for the 2022 Update reflects both new measures and measures carried forward from the 2015 Update. The Planning Committee re-prioritized all these measures based on current conditions 5 Plan Adoption This section of the plan was updated with a new on-going plan and implementation review and five-year update process that will assist the City in incorporating Maintenance hazard mitigation issues into other City planning and regulatory review processes and better prepare the City to update the plan in 2021. Moving forward into the next five-year plan implementation period there will be many more opportunities to incorporate hazard mitigation measures into the City’s decision-making processes. The City will document any actions taken within this iteration of the Natural Hazard Mitigation on challenges met and actions successfully adopted as part of the ongoing work of the biannual survey and four-year update to be conducted by the Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team, as described in Chapter 6 Plan Adoption and Maintenance. The Hazard Implementation Team did not meet regularly, conduct a bi-annual survey or four-year update as described in Chapter 6 perhaps due to the absence of any one City department having been designated to follow up and implement the plan and coordinate plan review and updating. This plan update includes a revised plan implementation process in Chapter 6 that addresses these issues from the previous update. AECOM ES-3Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 1. Introduction 1.1 Planning Requirements under the Federal Disaster Mitigation Act The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) requires that after November 1, 2004, all municipalities that wish to continue to be eligible to for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) funding to adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan, which must be updated in five-year intervals. This planning requirement does not affect post-disaster Public Assistance (PA) funding. Revere completed its Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) in 2005, and previously updated it in 2015. 1.1.1 Previous Federal and State Disasters The City of Revere has experienced 23 natural hazards that triggered federal or state disaster declarations since 1991. These are listed in Table 1-1 below.1 Most of these events involved severe storms.

This project totaled $485,000, with $360,000 covered by HMA funding and $125,000 covered by local match, as summarized in Table 1-2. Table 1-2: FEMA Funded Mitigation Projects (Utilizing HMGP) Project Title Scope of Work Total Cost Federal Funding Local Funding Oak Island Drainage Installation of new $485,000 $360,000 $125,000 Improvements tide gate; upgrade of existing culvert and tide gate. 1.2 Changes since 2015 Update D3. Was the plan revised to reflect changes in priorities? (Requirement §201.6(d)(3)) A significant revision to the City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan (2022 Update) includes the reorganization of natural hazards through the context of climate change to reflect the increasing urgency of climate change. This is consistent with the approach taken in the Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan – 2018 (2018 SHMCAP). Furthermore, FEMA’s National Risk Index (NRI) was leveraged to update the risk analysis and loss estimation. While there are some limitations with regards to analyzing NRI data at the local scale, it serves as a useful starting point to estimate damages from the following natural hazards for which loss estimates were not provided in the 2015 Update of the City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan (2015 Update): drought, landslides, hurricanes (beyond wind), severe winter storms, and tornadoes. The 2022 Update also reflects changes in flood risk from the 2017 update to the FEMA-delineated Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). Lastly, the mitigation goals and actions identified in the Hazard Mitigation Strategy were revised in accordance with the needs of the community. The City’s Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) planning process identified seven new mitigation actions to include in the 2022 Update, and 14 new actions were identified by the Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee and feedback from Stakeholder Meeting #1. AECOM 3Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 2. Planning Process An active stakeholder engagement and public involvement process is critical to developing or updating a hazard mitigation plan. This section describes the planning process taken with the Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee, which was established to lead the 2022 Update. Furthermore, the City recognizes that resilience planning is not limited to the hazard mitigation planning process. Resultantly, this section summarizes planning activities the City has taken to improve resilience that have occurred in addition to the efforts taken in accordance with CFR requirements. A review of how existing studies were incorporated into the 2022 Update is followed by a summary of public outreach activities taken to support the 2022 Update. 2.1.1 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee and Stakeholders A1. Does the Plan document the planning process, including how it was prepared and who was involved in the process for each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6 (C) (1)) The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee was led by Elle Baker, Open Space and Environmental Planner within the Revere Office of Planning and Development. Because the Office of Planning and Development has regulatory authority in the City, it was deemed appropriate to lead the 2022 Update. The Planning Committee was established to lead the planning process for the 2022 Update. Because the 2022 Update is for a single jurisdiction, every member of the Planning Committee represents the City of Revere. Some members of the Planning Committee are displayed in Table 2-1. A full stakeholder list representing the Planning Committee can be found in Appendix A. Table 2-1: Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Name Position Elle Baker Open Space and Environmental Planner Frank Stringi City Planner Paul Argenzio Superintendent, Department of Public Works Don Ciaramella Chief of Infrastructure Joe Maglione Water, Sewer, and Drainage Nick Rystrom City Engineer Chief Bright Chief, Fire Department Captain Robert Fortuna Fire Department Chief Callahan Chief, Police Department Nick Moulaison Former Chair, Conservation Commission Dr. Diane Kelly Superintendent, Revere Public Schools Robert O'Brien Former Director, Revere Planning and Development Mike Hinojosa Director, Parks and Recreation Ralph Harris Revere Housing Authority Ralph Decicco Chair, Commission on Disabilities AECOM 4Hazard Mitigation Plan Update As shown in Table 2-1 and Appendix A, the Planning Committee encompasses an interdisciplinary group of stakeholders from the City, and includes representation from first responders and emergency managers, planning and development, engineers and infrastructure operators, and the City’s school department. In addition, the Planning Committee includes stakeholder who represent community members with access and functional needs. 2.1.2 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Meeting #1 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Meeting #1 was held on January 20, 2021. The Planning Committee was provided an overview on the importance of updating hazard mitigation plans, benefits of updating hazard mitigation plans, and requirements of plan updates. Meeting #1 resulted in the identification of 14 new mitigation actions to be incorporated into the Hazard Mitigation Strategy. In addition, the Planning Committee discussed the following: • Opportunities to engage the public and other stakeholders. • Need for stakeholder engagement to be multi-lingual and accessible to English language learners. • Recent changes in development. • Updating priority projects for the mitigation strategy. Meeting minutes from Planning Committee Meeting #1 can be found in Appendix A. 2.1.3 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Meeting #2 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee #2 was held on April 27, 2021. The Planning Committee was provided an overview of and an opportunity to comment on the findings of the Risk Assessment. Furthermore, the Planning Committee reviewed 2015 Goal Statements, providing comments as necessary, and reviewed possible mitigation actions. In addition, the Planning Committee discussed and highlighted the following: • With so much private development going on in the City, some mitigation measures will be funded by developers while others will be funded by the City. • The City is collaborating on a joint project at Suffolk Downs. • Importance of identifying or clarifying the method of prioritizing mitigation actions. • Whether to incorporate data sourced from FEMA’s National Risk Index into the findings of the Rusk Assessment. Meeting minutes from Planning Committee Meeting #2 can be found in Appendix A. 2.2 Planning Activities Beyond the 2022 Update Hazard mitigation planning should not occur independent of other community planning activities. The City has held stakeholder workshops to support the Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Program and workshops specific to the Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study for the Point of Pines Riverside Area. Stakeholder engagement activities taken to support these efforts are summarized in the following sections. 2.2.1 Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Program The Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Program is designed to increase resiliency to natural hazards that are exacerbated by climate change at the municipal level. The planning process included 69 stakeholders representing municipal departments and decision-makers from the City of Revere, neighborhoods, business associations, and regional and state entities were invited to the workshops. A summary of each public information and listening session is included below. AECOM 5Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 2.2.1.1 Workshop 1 A total of 38 stakeholders attended Workshop 1 on January 10, 2019. Workshop 1 included an overview of the MVP Program and an introduction to climate change projections and natural hazards. A group discussion was held to identify the top hazards in Revere before participants separated into breakout groups representing five distinct geographic areas of the City. An expanded summary of Workshop 1 can be found in Appendix A. 2.2.1.2 Workshop 2 A total of 28 stakeholders attended Workshop 2 on January 31, 2019. Workshop 2 discussed the City’s objectives for the MVP Program, local natural and climate-related hazards of concern, and existing and future infrastructural, societal, and environmental strengths and weaknesses. Mitigation measures identified in the 2015 Update were also reviewed during Workshop 2, demonstrating the City’s interdisciplinary and holistic approach to mitigation and resilience planning. Participants brainstormed actions to reduce vulnerability and reinforce strengths for each of the City’s strengths and vulnerabilities. An expanded summary of Workshop 2 can be found in Appendix A. 2.2.1.3 Climate Change & Revere: A Community Listening Session Lastly, the City hosted the climate change listening session on April 4, 2019, attended by a total of 27 participants. The listening session offered participants the opportunity to ask questions and provide written comments. A summary of the listening section can be found in Appendix A. 2.2.2 Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study for the Point of Pines/Riverside Area The Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study for the Point of Pines/Riverside Area was identified as a top priority action from the MVP planning process, as the neighborhood is vulnerable to flooding and coastal erosion. The City has hosted two stakeholder workshops as of the time of the 2022 Update to support the feasibility study, which are summarized in the paragraphs below. 2.2.2.1 Stakeholder Workshop #1 A total of 18 attendees were present for the first workshop, held on December 15, 2020 in which current and future conditions were discussed. Stakeholders discussed existing concerns in addition to opportunities to collaborate with partners. A summary of the workshop can be found in Appendix A. 2.2.2.2 Stakeholder Workshop #2 A total of nine attendees were present for the second workshop, held on January 26, 2021. The purpose of the workshop was to provide an update on the feasibility study and discuss the assessment of current and future conditions in addition to the identification of potential short-term resilience measures. A summary of the workshop can be found in Appendix A. 2.3 Review and Incorporation of Existing Studies A4. Does the Plan review and incorporate existing plans, studies, reports, and technical information? (Requirement §201.6(b)(3)) Planning is an iterative and interdisciplinary process. Hazard mitigation plans should not be updated in isolation without consideration of stakeholder feedback sought for existing planning activities or the findings of such plans. As such, a variety of plans, studies, and reports were leveraged and incorporated into this Update. These sources are cited throughout this Update. Notable sources used throughout this Update are outlined below. 2.3.1 City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan – 2015 Update Because this is an update to Revere’s existing plan, the 2015 Update was leveraged as the bases for the 2022 Update. Details regarding major changes are included in Section 1.2 Changes since 2015 Update. AECOM 6Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 2.3.2 Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan – 2018 (2018 SHMCAP) As with previous Updates, the 2018 SHMCAP was leveraged as a starting point to identify potential hazards and the risk they present to the Commonwealth. A significant change in the 2018 SHMCAP compared to prior versions is the framing of potential hazards through lens of climate change interactions, which include changes in precipitation, sea level rise, rising temperatures, and extreme weather. The effects of climate change on each hazard, as identified in the 2018 SHMCAP, were incorporated into the Risk Assessment. 2.3.3 City of Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Summary of Findings Report – 2019 (Revere MVP Report, 2019) The 2019 Revere MVP Report identifies existing and future vulnerabilities and strengths and identifies opportunities to take action to reduce risk and build resilience, as well as implement key actions identified through the planning process. Specifically, seven new mitigation actions identified in the Hazard Mitigation Strategy were identified through the City’s MVP planning process. The MVP Report, 2019 is referenced throughout this Update. 2.3.4 Next Stop Revere – 2020 Next Stop Revere is the City’s Master Plan, the City’s first comprehensive master plan developed in more than four decades. Among other objectives, the plan aims to promote resiliency of the City in the face of increasing climate challenges through comprehensive climate mitigation and resiliency strategies and energy efficiency programs and to position City government at the forefront of regional collaboration, climate resiliency, and mitigation programs. In addition, Next Stop Revere was used to identify current and anticipated changes in development and to update Section 3.1 Community Profile. 2.3.5 National Risk Index The National Risk Index was used to update the Risk Analysis and Loss Estimation. While several limitations were identified with regards to applying the findings to a municipal scale, it provided a useful high-level summary of the community’s risk and vulnerability. 2.4 Public Outreach A3. Does the Plan document how the public was involved in the planning process during the drafting stage? (Requirement §201.6(b)(1)) The City of Revere has performed stakeholder engagement and sought public input on several planning initiatives to improve the City’s resilience to natural hazards during the current planning cycle. The City hosted two public stakeholder meetings that empower the community to participate in the 2022 Update. In addition to the Planning Committee, stakeholders representing state agencies, service and emergency service providers, developers, hospitals, neighborhood associations, and environmental organizations were targeted and engaged in the planning process. Stakeholders contacted are listed in Table 2-2.

The importance of hazard mitigation, hazard mitigation planning, and plan updates was discussed. The status of the 2022 Update and existing mitigation actions included in the Hazard Mitigation Strategy were discussed. Items discussed at Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 included the new Point of Pines Fire Station, the new Department of Public Works facility, and ongoing resiliency work at Suffolk Downs. A summary of Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 can be found in Appendix A. 2.4.2 Public Stakeholder Meeting #2 The second public stakeholder meeting was held on October 7, 2021. The meeting included a review on the importance of hazard mitigation, an overview of hazard mitigation planning and plan updates, and a summary of the findings of the 2022 Update, and an opportunity for comment and discussion. The meeting also provided the community the opportunity to review and comment on the 2022 Update, which wis posted on the City’s website, and community members were provided the opportunity to comment on the plan between October 1 and October 15. It was noted that the 2022 Update is a lengthy document for the general public to read, and as such, the Strategy section was excerpted for more accessible public viewing. A summary of Public Stakeholder Meeting #2 can be found in Appendix A. 2.5 Opportunity for Neighboring Communities and Regional Agencies A2. Does the Plan document an opportunity for neighboring communities, local and regional agencies involved in hazard mitigation activities, agencies that have the authority to regulate development as well as other interests to be involved in the planning process? (Requirement §201.6(b)(2)) The City provided the following communities the opportunity to participate in the planning process: • Chelsea • Winthrop • Saugus • Malden • Lynn • Everett These neighboring communities were invited to review and provide comments on the draft update, which was posted on the City’s website for public viewing. As previously stated, the City recognizes hazard mitigation planning should not occur independent of other community and resilience planning activities. The City is engaged with the neighboring communities of Chelsea and Winthrop through the North Suffolk Office of Resiliency and Sustainability (NSORS). The City has also been coordinating with the neighboring communities to progress regional flood mitigation efforts. Funding has been secured for a regional flood mitigation working group that will be advanced this fiscal year. In addition, the City has been coordinating regularly with the City of Boston to improve coastal flood resilience at Suffolk Downs, which encompasses portions of both cities. The cities are collaborating to identify opportunities for flood protection alignments based on existing physical conditions, the location of flood pathways, and the extent of flooding. AECOM 9Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 3. Risk Assessment The City’s climate, geography, and demography significantly determine its risk and vulnerability to impacts from natural hazards. Because risk is at the nexus of natural hazards and human infrastructure, this Risk Assessment begins with a review of Revere’s community profile. The community profile includes a review of the City’s social and economic profile, followed by the land use profile and a review of development trends. Finally, the community profile includes a review of the City’s climate, which affect many hazards the City may be vulnerable to and summarizes how the City’s climate has changed in recent decades. The Risk Assessment continues with a description of future climate projections in the city followed by a review all potential natural hazard events that may occur in the City, leveraging work completed as part of the 2018 2018 SHMCAP and the 2019 Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (Revere MVP, 2019) Summary of Findings Report to identify potential hazards. In compliance with the requirements outlined in 44 CFR § 201.6 (c) (2), the Risk Assessment provides the factual basis for activities proposed in the mitigation strategy to reduce losses from identified natural hazards, which are defined as environmental phenomena that have the potential to impact societies and the human environment.2 The Risk Assessment consists of the following components: • A description of the type, location, and extent of all-natural hazards that can affect the City, including previous occurrences and probability of future events, pursuant to 44 CFR § 201.6 (c) (2) (i). • A description of the City’s vulnerability to the hazards pursuant to 44 CFR § 201.6 (c) (2) (ii). The Risk Assessment is organized into the following sections: 3.1 Community Profile 3.2 Future Climate Change Projections in Revere 3.3 Natural Hazard Identification and Profile of Natural Hazards 3.4 Community Assets 3.5 Risk Analysis and Loss Estimation 3.6 Vulnerability Summary 3.1 Community Profile The Community Profile includes a summary of the City’s social and economic profile, land use profile and development trends, as well as an overview of the City’s climate profile, including current and future conditions. 3.1.1 Social and Economic Profile Revere is a developed city in Suffolk County, located between the North Shore and Boston. Data on social and economic conditions was compiled for comparative purposes and social and economic conditions are presented for Revere and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts using 2015-2019 American Community Survey 5-year estimates, the most recent data available. To assess how the social and economic conditions of the City have changed in recent years, 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-year estimates are also provided. The population of Revere has grown by approximately 7 percent since 2010, and currently has an approximate population of 53,700. According to Next Stop Revere, Revere’s Master Plan, the population will reach 66,700 by 2030 and 73,700 by 2040, an increase of 42 percent above the City’s 2010 2 Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Risk Index Primer, December 2020.

(Requirement §201.6(d)(3)) The City of Revere is largely developed, with limited developable land available. Resultantly, new development is largely limited to infill. As new development and redevelopment occurs, it will be subject to the latest building code requirements and zoning regulations. According to the Mass Builds database, 34 development projects were completed in Revere between 2015 and 2020 and another 21 are scheduled for completion in future years. Development projects are dispersed around the City and are not expected to significantly change the City’s vulnerability to natural hazards. While a sizable portion of the City is vulnerable to flooding and coastal hazards, the community’s participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) mitigates the community’s vulnerability to such hazards. Aside from tax exempt land (which includes public right of ways, easements, and municipal property), single-family and multi-family residential properties account for most of the City’s developable land. A breakdown of land use in Revere is provided in Table 3-7. 9 Table 3-7: Land Use Breakdown Land Use Percent Other exempt properties 9.3% Single family properties 18.0% Duplex/triplex 20.3% Small apartments (8 units or less) 1.2% Large apartments (more than 8 units) 4.6% Mixed use 0.7% Agriculture and outdoor recreation 1.1% Commercial - low density 11.1% Commercial - high density 0.5% Educational uses 0.0% Industrial properties, warehouses, and utilities 5.8% Tax exempt 27.3% A map visualizing the City’s land use using the most recent data available can be found in Appendix B.

Lastly, the Hazard Mitigation Strategy outlined in Section 4 reflects findings from Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee #1, in which the Planning Committee discussed recent changes in development, as noted in Section 0. Because Revere is largely developed, changes in development are primarily limited to infill development. At the Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee #1, it was noted there are approximately 3,500 more housing units in Revere than there were in 2014. 3.1.3 Climate Profile and Climate Change Prior to reviewing the climate profile of Revere, it is important to highlight the difference between climate, weather, and climate change. Climate: describes the typical weather conditions over a long period of time in a specific area. Typical indices of climate include temperature, precipitation, humidity, sun, and wind speed and direction. Climate refers to average indices, such as temperature and precipitation, over a long period of time. NOAA uses a time-period of 30 years to determine climate normal. AECOM 16Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Weather: refers to short-term changes in the atmosphere in the short-term. Natural hazards are frequently a result of hazardous weather events. Climate change: The climate at any location is not typically a steady state. Observations of factors such as temperature and precipitation, for example, regularly differ from long-term averages, and considerable variability over time is typical. However, when trends in these climate factors are observed to increase or decrease over extended periods of time (several decades or longer), this is referred to as “climate change”. 3.1.3.1 Climate Profile Using the Koppen-Geiger climate classification, Revere has a humid subtropical climate. This means the City has a temperate climate defined by hot summers and the lack of a dry season. The mean annual temperature in Revere is 50.1⁰ F, based on 30-year climate data provided by the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI). However, mean temperatures vary based on seasonal variations. Mean monthly and annual temperatures of Revere between 1991 and 2020 are displayed in Table 3-9.10 Table 3-9: Mean Monthly and Annual Temperatures in Revere Time Period Temperature (⁰F) Annual 50.7 January 28.6 April 47.8 July 73.1 October 52.9 Revere receives 48.3 inches of precipitation annually, on average, based on 30-year climate data provided by the NCEI. However, precipitation in Revere is not distributed uniformly throughout the year. Summer and winter months can be characterized as drier while months in the spring and autumn seasons are generally wetter. Average annual and monthly precipitation is displayed in Table 3-10.11 Table 3-10: Average Annual and Monthly Precipitation in Revere Time Period Precipitation (inches) Annual 48.3 January 3.8 April 4.2 July 3.5 October 4.7 10 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental information, Climate at a Glance: County Time Series, February 2021. 11 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental information, Climate at a Glance: County Time Series, February 2021. AECOM 17Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 3.1.3.2 Changing Climate Conditions The mean temperature has experienced observable increases since weather data began being recorded in 1895. The mean annual temperature increased approximately 3.7 ⁰F since 1895. As shown in Table 3-11, the temperature in Revere has not increased uniformly throughout the year.12 For instance, the mean temperatures in April and July have increased more than those of January and October. Table 3-11: Temperature Increase Since 1895 Time Period Temperature Increase Annual 3.7 January 2.8 April 3.7 July 3.6 October 1.9 Revere has experienced an observable increase in annual precipitation since 1895. Average annual precipitation has increased approximately 6.4 inches since 1895. However, precipitation has not increased uniformly throughout the year. For instance, Revere has experienced an approximate reduction of 0.1 inches of precipitation in the month of January since 1895 while average precipitation has not changed in the month of July since 1895. Change in precipitation is displayed in Table 3-1213. Table 3-12: Changes in Precipitation Since 1895 Time Period Change in Precipitation (inches) Annual 6.4 January -0.1 April 0.4 July 0.0 October 1.9 In addition to temperature and precipitation increases resulting from climate change, the sea level of Boston Harbor has increased by 0.9 feet since 1920, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) records, exacerbating potential damages from future hazard events. 3.2 Future Climate Change Projections in Revere A review of the City’s climate, geography, and demography is necessary to understand its current risk and vulnerability to natural hazards. Furthermore, this section includes an assessment of how climate change may exacerbate the City’s risk to natural hazards, with a focus on changes in precipitation, sea level rise, rising temperature, and extreme weather. 12 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental information, Climate at a Glance: County Time Series, February 2021. 13 AECOM analysis of data provided by the National Center for Environmental Information. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental information, Climate at a Glance: County Time Series, February 2021. AECOM 18Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 3.2.1 Changes in Precipitation As stated in the 2018 SHMCAP, changes in precipitation include changes in the amount, frequency, and timing of precipitation – including both rainfall and snowfall – are occurring across the globe as temperatures rise and other climate patterns shift in response. It is expected that precipitation will increase over this century. It is anticipated that total annual precipitation will increase by 1.0 to 6.0 inches by mid-century and by 1.2 to 7.3 inches by end of century. It is anticipated that precipitation will increase during the winter and spring months and decrease during the fall and summer months over this century. It is expected that climate change will result in more frequent, intense precipitation events in addition to more frequent extended periods of dry days. Precipitation changes are likely to exacerbate the following natural hazards: • Inland Flooding • Drought • Landslides 3.2.2 Sea Level Rise As stated in the 2018 SHMCAP, climate change will drive rising sea levels, and rising seas will have wide- ranging impacts on communities, natural resources, and infrastructure. Sea level rise is the rising water of levels resulting from meltwater of glaciers and ice sheets coupled with thermal expansion of seawater as it warms.14 The rise in relative mean sea level is projected to range from approximately 1 to 3 feet in the near term between 2000 and 2050), and from 4 to 10 feet by the end of this century (between 2000 and 2100) across the Commonwealth’s coastline (2018 SHMCAP). Sea level rise is expected to exacerbate the following natural hazards: • Coastal flooding • Coastal erosion • Tsunamis Sea level around Boston has risen by eight inches since 1950, rose by six inches between 1980 and 2016 and it is estimated the sea level around Boston will rise by another six inches in the next 15 years.15 3.2.3 Rising Temperatures As stated in the 2018 SHMCAP, average temperatures have risen steadily in the past 50 years, a trend that is expected to continue. Temperature: It is anticipated the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures will increase significantly over this century. It is anticipated the average annual temperature will increase by 2.8°F to 6.2°F by mid-century and by 3.8°F to 10.8°F by the end of this century (2018 SHMCAP). It is expected that temperatures will increase at a greater rate in winter months than in summer months. The long-term average minimum winter temperature is expected to increase by 4.6°F to 11.4°F by end of century.16 14 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Climate Change: Global Sea Level, January 2021.

AECOM 19Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Temperature changes are likely to exacerbate the following natural hazards: • Extreme temperatures • Wildfires • Invasive species 3.2.4 Extreme Weather As stated in the 2018 SHMCAP, climate change is expected to increase extreme weather events across Massachusetts. There is strong evidence that storms, from heavy downpours and blizzards to tropical cyclones and hurricanes, are becoming more intense and damaging, and can lead to devastating impacts for residents. In addition, precipitation and temperature changes are expected to exacerbate extreme weather events, affecting the following natural hazards: • Hurricanes/tropical storms • Severe winter storms • Tornadoes 3.3 Natural Hazard Identification and Profile of Natural Hazards This sub-section on natural hazard identification and profile of natural hazards includes a review of natural hazards identified in the 2018 SHMCAP. The review of natural hazards is followed by a profile of each hazard deemed applicable to the City. 3.3.1 Review of Natural Hazards The 2018 SHMCAP was leveraged as the basis to identify natural hazards that have the potential to affect the City. The 2018 SHMCAP identified 14 natural hazards that have the potential to affect Massachusetts, which are organized by climate change impacts and projections, as described in Section 3.2. By framing natural hazards through the context of climate change, this Update aligns with the 2018 SHMCAP and the Commonwealth’s resilient MA Climate Change Clearinghouse website, labeled as “Primary Climate Change Interaction.” These hazards and justification for inclusion/exclusion from this Update are summarized in Table 3-13.

AECOM 22Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 3.3.3 Natural Hazard Profiles B1. Does the Plan include a description of the type, location, and extent of all-natural hazards that can affect each jurisdiction(s)? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(i)) B2. Does the Plan include information on previous occurrences of hazard events and on the probability of future hazard events for each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(i)) This section of the Risk Assessment describes the type, location, and extent for each natural hazard profiled. It also assesses vulnerability, provides an overview of previous occurrences and the probability of future occurrences. While a comprehensive assessment of possible natural hazards was performed, the Risk Assessment prioritized the natural hazards with consequences that pose the greatest threat to life, property, and the environment in Revere. Resultantly, some natural hazards that are possible in Revere, such as thunderstorms, lightning, hail, and extreme precipitation, were not profiled separately. However, the consequences of these events, namely forest fires and flooding, are included in the Risk Assessment. Furthermore, hazardous weather and geologic events that pose a threat to people and the environment do not always occur independently of each other. Resultantly, some hazardous events, such as storm surge and tornadoes, are referenced under multiple natural hazard profiles. An overview of natural hazards considered is provided in Table 3-16. Natural hazard profiles are grouped by climate change interactions as outlined in Table 3-13.

Retrieved https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/terminology-index AECOM 24Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Inland flooding is generally caused by hurricanes, nor’easters, severe rainstorms, melting snowpack, and thunderstorms. Types of Flooding Events Coastal Flooding: The temporary inundation of beaches and other coastal land area, either resulting from coastal storms, hurricanes, or geologic events. Coastal flooding is profiled under Section 3.3.3.5 under Sea Level Rise. Flash Flood: Flooding that occurs with limited warning time, usually following extensive rainfall.19 Ice Jam: Flooding that results following the accumulation and build-up of floating ice fragments that block the normal flow of a river.20 Riverine/Riparian: When excessive runoff from longer-lasting rainstorms and snow melt causes a rise in the water level over a larger area.21 Storm Surge: The abnormal rise in seawater level during a storm, measured as the height of the water above the normal predicted astronomical tide. Storm surge is predominately caused by a storm’s winds pushing water onshore.22 Storm surge is captured under Hurricanes/Tropical Storms. Urban: The accumulation of floodwaters that result when the inflow of storm water exceeds the capacity of a drainage system to infiltrate water into the soil or carry it away.23 Location of Flooding Locations vulnerable to flooding in the City were determined using information from FEMA’s Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and from discussions with local officials. The FIRM flood zones, effective March 16, 2016, are provided in Appendix B. In addition, discussions with local officials identified the following flood-prone areas of the City: • Asti Avenue Neighborhood: floods consistently during combined high tide/precipitation events of greater than 1 inch. There is very limited flood storage capacity in this low-lying coastal area. • Elliot Circle: This site, adjacent to Revere Beach, experiences overtopping during combined high tide and storm events. • Point of Pines: Rock revetment and seawall along Mills Avenue is overtopped during storm events. Needs repairs from North Shore Road to River Avenue. • Cary Circle to Alden Avenue: Storm surge during high tide/storm events. • Rice Avenue near Yacht Club: Flooding due to storm surge/high tide events. • Revere Beach: The beach, from Cary Circle to Eliot Circle is overtopped by waves during high tide and coastal storm surge events. • Winthrop Parkway Neighborhood: Failing floodgate allows overtopping by storm surge and high tide during coastal storm events. 19 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Flash Flood Definition, no date.

Extent/Severity of Flooding Suffolk County receives 43.8 inches of rain annually, on average, determined based on data from NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information. This is above the national average annual precipitation of 31.3 inches.24 The National Weather Service classifies the severity of inland flooding as minor, moderate, or severe based on the types of impacts that occur, outlined as follows (2018 SHMCAP): • Minor: “nuisance only” degree of flooding that causes impacts such as road closures, flooding of recreational areas, and farmland. • Moderate: results in land with structures being inundated. • Major: widespread and life-threatening event. Previous Occurrences There have been several significant flood events that have affected the City and North Shore region of Massachusetts over the last 50 years. Flood events of historic significance include the following: • March 1968 • The Blizzard of 1978 • January 1979 • April 1987 • October 1991 (“The Perfect Storm”) • October 1996 • June 1998 • March 2001 • April 2004 • May 2006 • April 2007 • March 2010 Notable flood events affecting the City are summarized in Table 3-17.25 24 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Centers for Environmental Information – Climate at a Glance: Climate Time Series, May 2021, Retrieved https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/county/time-series/MA-025/pcp/12/12/1990- 2021?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000. 25 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Centers for Environmental Information, Storm Event Database, May 2021.

The Army Corps of Engineers estimated that the Blizzard of 1978 damaged over 1,200 homes in Revere, resulting in $16 million (1978$) in damages and 289 flood insurance claims resulting in $2.5 (1978$) million in pay-outs. The October 1991 storm resulted in 421 flood insurance claims totally $5.1 million (1991$) in pay-outs. County-level data on previous flooding occurrences was used as city-specific data summarizing previous flood events was not available. There were 10 non-coastal or non-urban small stream flood events between January 1950 and 2020; six of which resulted in property damage. No injuries or deaths were reported from the previous flood events, and the six flood events associated with property damage resulted in losses of $25.7 million. The most severe recent flooding occurred during the major storm of March 2010, when Suffolk County broke the record of 11 inches of rain set in 1953. During the month of March of 2010, a new total of 14.83 inches of rainfall accumulation was officially recorded by the National Weather Service (NWS). Probability of Future Events and Changes from Previous Update Inland Flooding in Revere is considered a “High Frequency” event that has a recurrence interval of less than 10 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of inland flooding occurring in the City is greater than 10-percent. Repetitive Loss Structures As defined by the Community Rating System (CRS) of the NFIP, a repetitive loss property is any property which the NFIP has paid two or more flood claims of $1,000 or more in any given 10-year period since 1978. More information on repetitive loss structures can be found in Section 3.4. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Severe flooding can cause damage to buildings and infrastructure. The locations susceptible to flooding, listed under Location of Flooding, cover approximately 397 acres, or 6.2 percent of the City’s land area. Assuming all structures are evenly distributed throughout the City, approximately 940 of the 15,100 structures are vulnerable to flooding. Low-lying areas and land in the FEMA-delineated SFHA are also vulnerable to flooding. In addition, the Revere MVP Summary of Findings Report identified the following areas as vulnerable to inland flooding: West/North Revere: The West / North Revere area has frontage on both the east and west sides of the Pine River and lies to the southwest of Rumney Marsh. The west side of this region of the city along the Malden border is within the FEMA 100-year floodplain. The drainage system is of particular concern in this area. Storm drainage systems on Washington Avenue and Amelia Place and catch basins on Asti Avenue and Tuscano Avenue are insufficient to manage stormwater. This results in pooling of water in these areas. Along Route 1, tide gates that are not adequately maintained exacerbate flooding within the Town Line Brook watershed. Area-wide challenges include illegal sewer hookups, downed trees, groundwater infiltration, and expansion of flood zones. Additionally, backfill on properties has reduced the area available for collecting and storing water during precipitation events. Sales Creek: The Sales Creek area lies almost entirely within the FEMA 100-year floodplain and is flanked by the Chelsea River, Belle Isle Marsh, and Broad Sound. This is a densely developed portion of Revere’s AECOM 28Hazard Mitigation Plan Update waterfront with multiple schools, subway stations, local and State police, a transit-oriented development economic development area, and ongoing construction. Factors that increase vulnerability in this region of the city include the poor condition of water and sewer infrastructure, evacuation and emergency routes that are susceptible to flooding, and characteristics of the population that resides here — including low- income populations, non-native English speakers, renters, and newcomers — which can be more challenging to reach through the City’s conventional communication methods. Topography in this area makes low-lying areas vulnerable to flooding. The fire and police departments off Revere Beach Parkway and the police department on Ocean Avenue are identified as vulnerable locations. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of inland flooding. Changes in precipitation patterns, including more intense and frequent downpours, increase the likelihood of inland flooding as soils become saturated. Climate change is also likely to increase the frequency and intensity of severe storm events, further increasing the likelihood of inland flooding. 3.3.3.3 Drought General Definition Drought is a period of below-average precipitation in a given region, resulting in prolonged shortages in its water supply. This can include atmospheric, surface water, or groundwater. Types of Drought Events: Meteorological Drought: When dry weather patterns dominate an area. Hydrologic Drought: When low water supply becomes evident in steams, reservoirs, and groundwater levels. Hydrological drought indicators lag significantly behind meteorological drought indicators. Agricultural Drought: When precipitation deficits, soil water deficits, reduced ground water, or reduced reservoirs levels impact agricultural yields. Socioeconomic Drought: When physical drought conditions impact the supply and demand of economic goods and services. Location of Drought Because drought classifications are relative to the average local precipitation, surface, and groundwater levels, the entire City is susceptible to drought. Extent/Severity of Drought The U.S. Drought Monitor categorizes the severity of drought on scale of D0 to D4, which is outlined in Table 3-18.26 Table 3-18: USDM Drought Classification Category Description Possible Impacts D0 Abnormally Dry Going into drought: - Short-term dryness slowing planting, growth of crops, or pastures. Coming out of drought: - Some lingering water deficits. - Pastures or crops not fully recovered. D1 Moderate Drought - Some damage to crops or pastures. - Streams, reservoirs, or well low, some water shortages developing or imminent. - Voluntary water-use restrictions requested. 26 University of Nebraska-Lincoln, United States Drought Monitor, 2021. Retrieved https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/DroughtClassification.aspx AECOM 29Hazard Mitigation Plan Update D2 Severe Drought - Crop or pasture losses likely. - Water shortages common. - Water restrictions imposed. D3 Extreme Drought - Major crop/pasture losses. - Widespread water shortages or restrictions. D4 Exceptional Drought - Exceptional and widespread crop/pasture losses. - Shortages of water in reservoirs, streams, and wells creating water emergencies. Massachusetts uses several indices to determine regional drought status, including the Standard Precipitation Index, crop moisture index, groundwater levels, stream flow, and reservoir levels to classify drought. Such indices were combined to develop five regional drought classifications in Massachusetts, outlined in Table 3-19.

Drought in Revere is considered a “Low Frequency” event that have a recurrence interval of between 100 and 1,000 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of a drought occurring in the City is between 1.0 and 0.1-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability While drought does not pose a significant risk to the City, it can impact agricultural production and water access to residents on private water supplies. Residents on private water supply are the most vulnerable to drought events. The City’s connection to a regional, public water supply limits the vulnerability of the community to drought events. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to result in precipitation anomalies, including prolonged dry spells and droughts. Furthermore, the likelihood of drought will increase resulting from climate change because it is anticipated that less precipitation will be in the form of snow, lessening the opportunity for groundwater recharge. 3.3.3.4 Landslides General Definition The term landslide includes a wide range of ground movements, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes, and shallow debris flows (2018 SHMCAP). The most common types of landslides in Massachusetts include translational debris slides, rotational slides, and debris flows. Most of these events are caused by a combination of unfavorable geologic conditions (silty clay or clay layers contained in glaciomarine, glaciolacustrine, or thick till deposits), steep slopes, and/or excessive wetness leading to excess pore pressures in the subsurface. Location of Landsides Landslides have the potential to occur anywhere in the City. However, landslides are more likely to occur in locations with the following characteristics or under the following circumstances27: • Steep slopes with thick deposits of unconsolidated earth materials. • River cut banks and coastal bluff areas that have been undermined by high flow/tides or storm events. 27 Maine Emergency Management Agency, State Hazard Mitigation Plan – 2019 Update. Retrieved https://www.maine.gov/mema/sites/maine.gov.mema/files/inline- files/State%20Hazard%20Mitigation%20Plan%202019%20Update_10.8.2019.pdf AECOM 31Hazard Mitigation Plan Update • Prolonged wet periods that add water weight and reduce slope strength. According to the Slope Stability Map of Massachusetts, produced by the Massachusetts Geological Survey, most of the land in Revere is rated as stable.28 However, the Slope Stability Map identified a stretch of land adjacent to Chelsea Creek, near the Chelsea and Revere border as moderately stable. Stretches of land alongside Massachusetts 145 were also rated moderately stable while some patches of land in the northwest portion of Revere, just north of Rumney March, are rated unstable. Extent/Severity of Landslides While there is not currently an accepted standardized scale to classify land slide events, the extent of landslides can be characterized by the area of ground disturbed. Previous Occurrences While the City does not record data on landslide occurrences, there have been no known landslides in Revere. The best available data is for Suffolk County. Suffolk County has not experienced landslide events since 1950. Probability of Future Events and Changes since Previous Update Landslides in Revere are considered “Very Low Frequency” events that have a recurrence interval of greater than 1,000 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of a landslide occurring in the City is less than 0.1-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability A landslide in Revere could destroy buildings and infrastructure. While the probability of a landslide occurring in Revere is unlikely, the entire City is susceptible to damage resulting from landslides. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change could indirectly increase the frequency of landslides. Increased precipitation resulting from climate change and reduced soil stability from climate-induced drought events could trigger landslides. Sea Level Rise Sea level rise will affect risk of coastal flooding, coastal erosion, and tsunamis. 3.3.3.5 Coastal Flooding General Definition Coastal flooding is the inundation of normally dry land along the ocean coast and other inland waters from the movement of ocean water above the normal present-day tidal range. Coastal flooding is influenced by meteorological events, such as severe weather events resulting in storm surge, as well as geologic events, such as earthquake-induced tsunamis. Please note, storm surge is profiled under Hurricanes/Tropical Storms and tsunamis are profiled under Tsunamis. Locations of Coastal Flooding Coastal flooding is associated with severe coastal storms that, through the combination of winds and tides, drive tidal waters to higher levels than normally experienced, leading to the inundation of low-lying land areas and the overtopping of sea walls. Extent/Severity of Coastal Flooding The most severe storm event in Revere was the “Blizzard of ‘78” on February 6-7, 1978, which had a peak surge coinciding with a spring tide to create a 100-year water level of 14.9 feet mean low water at the National Ocean Survey Boston Harbor gauge. 28 Massachusetts Geological Survey, Slope Stability Map of Massachusetts, 2013.

Alternatively stated, the annual probability of coastal flooding occurring in the City is greater than 10-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on Community and Vulnerability Coastal flooding can damage buildings and infrastructure. Residents directly adjacent to the coast are most vulnerable to coastal flooding. The Revere MVP Summary of Findings Report identified the following areas as vulnerable to flooding: Beachmont: Several areas are susceptible to flooding in the southeast corner of Revere. Areas along Winthrop Parkway from the Elliot Circle to the Revere-Winthrop border and within the Winthrop Parkway Neighborhood are vulnerable to flooding. Portions of this area lie within the FEMA 100-year and 500-year floodplains. The beaches and shoreline of coastal areas and streets — such as Broad Sound Avenue — within the Beachmont area are vulnerable to sea level rise and storm surge. Streets to the north and northwest of Belle Isle Marsh Reservation, including Pearl Avenue, Belle Isle Avenue, Winthrop Avenue, and Bennington Street have experienced flooding. This region is home to schools, pump stations, a tide gate, and areas designated as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern by the State. Point of Pines/Riverside: Except for elevated areas around the Route 1A on-ramp, all the Point of Pines / Riverside area is located within the FEMA 100-year floodplain. This region of the City has widespread vulnerability to flooding. Route 1A, Mills Avenue, Rice Avenue, and Revere Beach Boulevard have experienced localized flooding and drainage issues. Residences in the neighborhoods of this area have experienced flooding and increased flood insurance rates. There are several vulnerable tide gates located along Route 1A. The Point of Pines Yacht Club, Point of Pines Beach, and associated piers, docks, and water access points are exposed to wind and storm surge. The Point of Pines Yacht Club is identified as an emergency gathering space. Oak Island/Revere Beach: Like the Beachmont and Point of Pines / Riverside areas, the Oak Island / Revere Beach area is characterized by low-lying areas within the FEMA 100-year floodplain, coastal frontage, and marshes. Non-functional flood gates and an antiquated drainage system contribute to flood vulnerability in this part of the City. Within this area, the high density of traffic along Roosevelt Avenue, Revere Street, and Broadway combined with flood vulnerability impact emergency access. Additional hazards in this area include risk of fire due to the prevalence of Phragmites in the marsh near the Wonderland Greyhound Park and coastal erosion. Populations in low-income and senior housing and schools in the Oak Island / Revere Beach area are among the vulnerable social features in this area. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of routine tidal flooding and storm- related flooding in the City. Climate change is also expected to increase the frequency and severity of severe storm events, such as hurricanes and nor’easters, that would result in more coastal flooding from storm surge. Severe storm events coupled with sea level rise could exacerbate the extent of coastal flooding. AECOM 34Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 3.3.3.6 Coastal Erosion General Definition The process by which local sea level rise, strong wave action, and coastal flooding wear down or carry away rocks, soils, and sands along the cost; all coastlines are affected by storms and other natural events that cause erosion.30 Location of Coastal Erosion Storm surges accelerate erosion along beaches and undermine sea walls, some of which are decades old. Failure of seawalls and shoreline erosion increase the vulnerability of nearby structures. Located on Broad Sound, the east facing shoreline of Revere is exposed to coastal erosion. Approximately five miles of shoreline is directly exposed, with the remaining shoreline semi-protected by offshore structures or landforms. The city is protected from coastal storms by both natural and human- made shoreline structures. There are 15 structures including 11 bulkheads/seawalls, 3 revetments, and one breakwater. Nine of these structures are owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and six are owned by the City of Revere. The Massachusetts Coastal Infrastructure Assessment Project rated the condition of 10 of these structures “B” (structures requiring limited or no repair) and the remaining five were rated “C” (structures requiring moderate to limited repair). The inventory is summarized in Table 3-22.31 Table 3-22: Inventory of Coastal Structures in Revere Primary Structure A B C D F Total Length (ft) Seawall/Bulkhead 9 2 11 21,585 Revetment 1 2 3 2,600 Breakwater 1 1 2.725 Total 10 5 15 26,890 Key A: Excellent - Like new condition. B: Good – Minor problems, superficial in nature C: Fair – Structure is sound but may have minor deterioration D: Poor – Advanced levels of deterioration; risk of damage and possible failure F: Critical – Conditions may warrant emergency stabilization According to a US Army Corps of Engineers study of Revere Beach, the coastal reach from Revere Beach to Point of Pines forms a littoral cell bordered to the southwest by Roughans Point headland and by the Saugus River estuary to the northeast. Exposure to waves from the southeast via Broad Sound and partial sheltering by Nahant Peninsula to the east combine to create a general southwest-to- northeast direction of sediment transport. Wave energy tends to focus at two locations: between Revere and Beach Streets, and at Carey Circle. In addition to flood hazards, coastal shorelines change constantly in response to wind, waves, tides, sea level fluctuation, seasonal and climatic variations, human alteration, and other factors that influence the movement of sand and material within a shoreline system.

Retrieved https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/08/pa/marblehead-revere.pdf AECOM 35Hazard Mitigation Plan Update coastal land is a visible result of the way shorelines are reshaped in the face of these dynamic conditions. Shorelines tend to change seasonally, accreting slowly during the summer months when sediments are deposited by relatively low energy waves and eroding dramatically during the winter when sediments are moved offshore by high-energy storm waves, such as those generated by nor’easters. Regardless of the season, coastal storms typically cause erosion. With the anticipated change in climate an increase in intensity and frequency of storms is expected. Extent/Severity of Coastal Erosion A study of shoreline change in Massachusetts by the U.S. Geological Survey, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Sea Grant Program, and Cape Cod Cooperative Extension reveals that approximately 68 percent, or 513 miles, of Massachusetts' ocean- facing shore exhibits a long-term erosion trend, 30 percent, or 226 miles, shows long-term accretion, and two percent, or 15 miles, shows no net change. For the entire ocean-facing Massachusetts shore, from the mid -1800’s to 1994, the long- term average annual shoreline change rate ranges between -0.58 and 0.75 feet per year. Approximately 46 percent of the Massachusetts shore is eroding at one foot or less per year, while 22 percent of the shore is accreting at one foot or less per year. Eighty-one percent of the shore fluctuates +/-2 feet per year. Previous Occurrences Historic coastal erosion is difficult to quantify due to the extent of human interventions have altered the coast of Revere. Furthermore, Coastal shorelines change constantly in response to wind, waves, tides, sea level fluctuation, seasonal and climatic variations, human alteration, and other factors that influence the movement of sand and material within a shoreline system. While discrete storm events can accelerate coastal erosion, it is generally a continuous event resulting from earth’s processes. However, it is estimated the shoreline within the vicinity of Boston is fluctuating 0.3 feet annually.32 Probability of Future Events and Changes from Previous Update Coastal erosion in Revere is considered a “High Frequency” event that has a recurrence interval of less than 10 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of coastal erosion occurring in the City is greater than 10-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Coupled with sea level rise, coastal erosion can increase the vulnerability of residents further from the coast to coastal flooding, exacerbating the impacts of coastal flooding. Residents adjacent to the coastline are most vulnerable to coastal erosion. Impacts of Climate Change It is anticipated that sea level rise resulting from climate change will exacerbate the rate and extent of coastal erosion in Massachusetts. In general, sandy shoreline retreats landward approximately 100 feet for every foot of sea level rise (2018 SHMCAP). 3.3.3.7 Tsunamis General Definition FEMA defines tsunami as a series of enormous seismic sea waves created by an underwater disturbance caused by geologic activity in the form of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, underwater landslides, or meteorites striking the Earth. 32 Massachusetts Coastal Erosion Commission, Report of the Massachusetts Coastal Erosion Commission, December 2015. Retrieved https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/12/sd/cec-final-report-dec2015-complete.pdf AECOM 36Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Locations of Atlantic Based Tsunamis Tsunamis are a potential city-wide hazard in Revere. While the probability of a tsunami striking Revere is unlikely, it is assumed in the 2018 SHMCAP that a tsunami could inundate portions of the City within a mile of the coastline. Extent/Severity of Atlantic Based Tsunamis Tsunamis are typically measured by their height at the shore and the maximum run-up of the tsunami waves on the land (2018 SHMCAP). Previous Occurrences There is no historical record of tsunami events occurring in the City. Probability of Future Events and Changes from Previous Update Tsunami events in Revere are considered “Very Low Frequency” events that have a recurrence interval of greater than 1,000 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of a landslide occurring in the City is less than 0.1-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Like other forms of coastal flooding, tsunamis can damage buildings and infrastructure, and can also result in loss of life. While the likelihood of a tsunami is low, those most adjacent to the coastline are most susceptible to tsunamis. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change will increase the likelihood of tsunamis in the future. As ice melts because of climate change, the likelihood of earthquakes and submarine landslides will increase, potentially triggering tsunamis. Furthermore, the impact of collapsing glaciers may trigger tsunamis as a secondary threat following landslides. Rising Temperatures Rising temperatures will affect risk of extreme temperatures, wildfires, and invasive species. 3.3.3.8 Extreme Temperatures General Definition There is no universal definition for extreme temperatures. The term is relative to the usual weather in the region based on climatic averages. Revere has four well-defined seasons. The seasons have several defining factors, with temperature one of the most significant. Extreme temperatures can be defined as those, which are far outside of the normal seasonal ranges for Massachusetts. The average temperatures for Massachusetts are as follows: • Winter (Dec-Feb) Average: 31.8°F • Summer (Jun-Aug) Average: 71°F Extreme temperatures include extreme heat and extreme cold. Extreme Heat: Extreme heat, for this climatic region, is usually defined as a period of 3 or more consecutive days above 90 °F, but more generally a prolonged period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high humidity. Extreme cold, again, is relative to the normal climatic lows in a region. Extreme Cold: Extreme cold is more difficult to define but is relative to normal climatic lows in the region. Location of Extreme Temperatures The entire City of Revere is susceptible to extreme temperatures. AECOM 37Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Extent/Severity of Extreme Temperatures The National Weather Service uses Wind Chill Advisories/Warnings and Heat Advisories/Warnings to measure the extent of extreme temperatures. Heat Parameters: • Heat Advisory: temperatures between 100°F and 104°F for at least two hours • Heat Warning: temperatures at or above 105°F for at least two hours Wind Chill Parameters: • Wind Chill Advisory: temperatures between - 15°F and 24°F for at least three hours • Wind Chill Warning: temperatures at or below -25°F for at least three hours Previous Occurrences Previous occurrences of excessive heat events in Suffolk County are summarized in Table 3-23.

Alternatively stated, the annual probability of an extreme weather event occurring in the City is greater than 10-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Extreme temperatures threaten public health and can limit access to lifeline utilities such as electricity and potable water. Residents without access to sufficient heat sources in the winter months and air conditioning in the summer months are most likely to suffer adverse effects from extreme temperatures. Vulnerable populations include low-income residents, those with limited access to climate control mechanisms, and elderly populations that are most susceptible to extreme temperatures. Impacts of Climate Change Annual extreme heat events are expected to increase up to seven-fold by 2050 because of climate change. 3.3.3.9 Wildfires General Definition A wildfire is any non-structure fire that occurs in vegetative wildland that contains grass, shrub, leaf litter, and forested tree fuels (2018 SHMCAP). Wildfires in Massachusetts are caused by natural events, human activity, or prescribed fire. Location of Wildfire Wildfires can occur throughout the City, though the following locations have been identified as having the highest potential for brush fires: • Washburn Avenue area- sparks from Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Blue Line subway cause marsh grass fires. • MBTA Blue Line subway tracks area between Wonderland Dog Track to Revere Street; sparks from vehicles’ wheels causes marsh grass fires. • MBTA Blue Line subway tracks area between Revere Street and Oak Island; subway wheel sparks cause marsh grass fires. • North Revere area: vandals. • North Shore Road: North of Oak Island to Mills Avenue and east side of Route 1A: vandals. • West of Washington Avenue from Amelia Place to Sherman Street: vandals. • Revere Beach Parkway from Pratt Avenue to Suffolk Downs: vandals set fires in marsh grass. • Bird Sanctuary at Tank Farm: vandal and lightening caused brush fires. Extent/Severity of Wildfire The severity of wildfires is measured by acres burned. Based on the locally identified known fire hazard areas, the maximum extent of potential fire damage in Revere is summarized in Table 3-25. Table 3-25: Maximum Extent of Potential Fire Damage Fire Hazard Area Acres Washburn Avenue area 18 MBTA Blue Line Wonderland Dog Track 15 MBTA Blue Line Revere Street and Oak Island 78 AECOM 39Hazard Mitigation Plan Update North Revere area 92 North Shore Road 74 West of Washington Avenue 81 Revere Beach Parkway 12 Bird Sanctuary at Tank Farm 7 Total Fire Hazard Area 377 Previous Occurrences Over the ten-year period from 2004 to 2014 the Revere Fire Department logged a total of 271 wildfire incidences, of which 60 percent were brush or mixed brush/grass fires, and 30 percent were grass fires. The remaining 10 percent included fires categorized as forest, woods or wildland fires, natural vegetation fires, other, and special outside fires, other. Only seven of these fires over the ten-year period resulted in dollar losses; and the average of these was $7,300. The Fire Chief estimates that the area impacted averages four to five acres per year. Probability of Future Events and Changes from Previous Update Wildfire events in Revere are a “High” frequency event, indicating the estimated recurrence interval is less than 10 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of a tornado occurring in Revere is greater than 10-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Wildfires can destroy buildings and result in loss of life. Residents most living adjacent to the areas listed under Locations of Wildfires are most vulnerable to their impacts. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to increase the risk of wildfires as precipitation anomalies and prolonged drought events increase the risk of wildfire. 3.3.3.10 Invasive Species General Definition Invasive species are organisms that are not native to local ecosystems. Absent native predators and competitors are often disruptive and damaging to native ecosystems, displace native species. Locations of Invasive Species Due to the massive scope of the hazard of invasive species, the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts experiences impacts of invasive species (2018 SHMCAP). Using the findings of the 2018 SHMCAP as a basis, the entire City of Revere is vulnerable to the impacts resulting from invasive species. Extent/Severity of Invasive Species Invasive species are a widespread problem throughout the City, though the geographic extent varies depending on the species in question (2018 SCHMAP). Previous Occurrences Following introduction, presence of invasive species is a continuous event that does not have discrete occurrences. Resultantly, it is difficult to measure the frequency of previous occurrences. Probability of Future Events and Changes from the Previous Update Invasive species are expected to be an increasing challenge throughout the City. Invasive species were not profiled in the previous Update. AECOM 40Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability It is rare for invasive species to directly impact humans. The entire City is vulnerable to adverse impacts from invasive species. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to facilitate the migration and introduction of invasive species to non-native ecosystems. Furthermore, it is anticipated that native ecosystems of Massachusetts will be further stressed by the impacts of climate change, including increased periods of heavy precipitation and extended drought, and increasing temperatures, making native ecosystems more vulnerable to displacement. Extreme Weather Extreme weather resulting from climate change will affect risk from the hurricanes and tropical storms, severe winter storms, and tornadoes. 3.3.3.11 Hurricanes/Tropical Storms General Definition Hurricanes are tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 74 miles per hour or greater. A tropical cyclone is a rotating low-pressure weather system. Tropical cyclones with maximum sustained surface winds of less than 39 miles per hour are classified as tropical cyclones, while tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds of 39 miles per hour or greater are classified as tropical storms. Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30.35 Types of Hurricanes/Tropical Storms Hurricanes and tropical storm events include a bundle of natural hazards. The primary hazards associated with tropical cyclones are outlined as follows: • Storm surge • Wind • Inland freshwater flooding • Tornadoes Location of Hurricanes/Tropical Storms The entire City is susceptible to strong winds, inland freshwater flooding, and tornadoes. As Revere is a coastal city, much of the land area is susceptible to storm surge. Extent of Hurricanes/Tropical Storms The strength of a hurricane is measured by the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale, which is outlined in Table 3-26.36 Table 3-26: Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale Category Sustained Types of Damage Due to Hurricane Winds Winds Tropical Up to 38 N/A Depression mph Tropical 39-73 mph N/A Storm 35 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, What is a hurricane?

Large branches of trees will snap, and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days. 2 96-110 mph Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage: Well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with outages that could last from several days to weeks. 3 111-129 mph Devastating damage will occur: Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends.

Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes. 4 130-156 Catastrophic damage will occur: Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage mph with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted, and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months. 5 157 mph or Catastrophic damage will occur: A high percentage of framed homes will be higher destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months. mph – miles per hour Previous Occurrences The region has been impacted by hurricanes throughout its history, starting with the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.

As stated in the 2018 SHMCAP, 65 hurricane or tropical storm events occurred in Massachusetts between 1842 and 2017. On average, storms severe enough to receive a FEMA disaster declaration have occurred every nine years. NOAA estimates there is an average annual probability of 1-2 percent of a major hurricane making landfall in Massachusetts.37 The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Hurricanes can destroy structures and infrastructure, and result in loss of life. The entire City is susceptible to damage from hurricane winds while those in low-lying coastal areas are most susceptible to damage from hurricane storm surge. The Massachusetts Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Viewer visualizes locations in Revere vulnerable to storm surge from hurricanes. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms, fueled by warming ocean temperatures. Furthermore, climate change is likely to increase the rate of rainfall during hurricanes, increasing the potential for inland flooding. Sea level rise will exacerbate storm surge during hurricanes. 3.3.3.12 Severe Winter Storms General Definition Severe winter storms are characterized by ice and snow accumulation, strong winds, and low temperatures. Types of Winter Storms Winter storms can include blizzards, heavy snowstorms, “nor’easters”, and sleet and ice storms. Location of Winter Storms The entire City is susceptible to winter storms. 37 National Oceanic Administration, no title, no date. Retrieved https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/images/return_mjrhurr.jpg AECOM 43Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Extent/Severity of Winter Storms The average annual snowfall for most of the City ranges from 36.1 to 48 inches, except for a small portion of northwest Revere where the average ranges from 48.1 inches to 72 inches of snowfall. The Regional Snowfall Index (RSI) is used to measure the extent of winter storms. The RSI ranks snowstorm impacts on a scale from 1 to 5, and factors the spatial extent of the storm, the amount of snowfall, and the juxtaposition of these elements with population.38 The RSI is summarized in Table 3-28.39 Table 3-28: Regional Snowfall Index Category RSI Value (inches of snowfall) Description 1 1-3 Notable 2 3-6 Significant 3 6-10 Major 4 10-18 Crippling 5 18 and above Extreme The Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) was used to rank and characterize high-impact northeast snowstorms with large areas of 10-inch accumulation and greater prior to the RSI.

Data for Suffolk County, which includes Revere, is the best available data to help understand previous occurrences and impacts of winter storm events. According to National Climate Data Center (NCDC) records, Suffolk County has only experienced one blizzard between 1950 and 2021, in February of 2013, which resulted in no deaths or property damage in Suffolk County. For the same time period, Suffolk County experienced 40 heavy snowfall events, resulting in no deaths, one injury and $9.582 million dollars in property damage. Using the NESIS scale for magnitude and the National Weather Service’s definition of heavy snowfall, it can be deduced that Suffolk County has experienced a minimum of 40 NESIS Category 3 heavy snowfall events since 1950.

AECOM 46Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Probability of Future Events and Changes from Previous Update In Massachusetts, winter storms happen multiple times each year. Winter storms are considered a “High” frequency event in Revere, indicating the estimated recurrence interval is less than 10 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of a tornado occurring in Revere is greater than 10-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Winter snowstorms and extended cold weather are frequent hazards in New England. The impact of heavy snowfall is to impair the flow of vehicles needed for day-to-day commuting, local businesses, and public safety response. In addition, infrastructure, including critical utilities, may be impacted by winter storms and power outages and hazards to navigation and aviation can occur. During winter storms, there is an increased risk of fire due to loss of electricity and the associated use of portable heaters, gas stoves, candles, and other flammable sources of heat and light. Fire during winter storms presents a great danger because water supplies may freeze, and it may be difficult for firefighting apparatus to get to a fire. The added impacts from heavy snow and ice can affect transportation infrastructure and negatively impact both the local and regional economies. The entire City is vulnerable to impacts from severe winter storms, though marginalized communities such as elderly and low-income populations are most vulnerable to adverse effects resulting from severe winter storms. Impacts of Climate Change It is expected that climate change will increase the frequency and severity of severe winter storms. Climate change may result in increased snow fall and increased intensity of winter storms. 3.3.3.13 Tornadoes General Definition A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that extends from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud to the ground. Location of Tornadoes The location of a tornado is generally unpredictable, though historical records indicate tornadoes are less likely to strike in coastal communities such as Revere than they are to strike in inland communities across the Commonwealth. The potential remains for tornadoes to strike anywhere in the City. Extent of Tornadoes The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale is used to measure the severity of tornadoes. The Fujita Tornado Damage Scale is summarized in Table 3-31.42 Table 3-31: Enhanced Fujita Scale Scale Wind Speed – 3 Typical Effects Second Gust (mph) F0 65-85 Gale tornado (weak); light damage to chimneys; breaks twigs and branches off trees; pushes over shallow-rooted trees; damages signboards; some windows broken. F1 86-110 Moderate tornado (weak); Moderate damage: peels surface off roofs; mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned; outbuildings demolished; moving autos pushed off roads; trees snapped or broken. F2 111-135 Significant tornado (strong); considerable damage: roofs torn off frame houses; mobile homes demolished; frame houses with weak foundations lifted and 42 U.S. Department of Commerce, The Enhanced Fujita Scale, no date.

Previous Occurrences While the City does not have an extensive history of tornadoes, an F2 tornado struck the City on July 28, 2014. The tornado touched down at 9:32 am in Chelsea just south of Route 16 (Revere Beach Parkway) and moved north into Revere’s business district along Broadway, past Revere City Hall, and ended at 9:36 AM near the intersection of Routes 1 and 60 (see Figure 3-1). The path was approximately two miles long and ⅜-mile-wide, with wind speeds up to 120 miles per hour. According to Revere Fire Chief Gene Doherty 65 homes had “substantial damages” and 13 homes and businesses were uninhabitable. The city set up a shelter at a local school for displaced residents. National Grid reported that 3,000 homes were without power. Figure 3-1: Path of Revere Tornado on July 28, 2014 Probability of Future Events and Changes from Previous Update Based on the record of previous occurrences since 1950, Tornado events in Revere are a “Medium” frequency event, indicating the estimated recurrence interval ranges between 10 and 100-years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of a tornado occurring in Revere ranges from 1-percent to 10- percent. AECOM 48Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Tornadoes can damage buildings and infrastructure and result in loss of life. While the likelihood of a tornado striking Revere is low, the entire community is vulnerable to tornadoes. Impacts of Climate Change While climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of thunderstorms and hurricanes, which can both include tornadoes, the impacts of climate change on tornadoes are not certain. 3.3.4 Non-Climate Influenced Hazards Earthquakes represent a non-climate influenced hazard that poses a risk to the City. 3.3.4.1 Earthquakes General Definition An earthquake is the vibration of the Earth’s surface that follows a release of energy in the Earth’s crust (2018 SHMCAP). Location of Earthquakes Earthquakes have the potential to affect the entire City of Revere. Massachusetts, like the other New England States, is located deep within the interior of the North American Plate; resultantly, Revere is most susceptible to intraplate earthquakes (2018 SHMCAP). Extent/Severity of Earthquakes The Richter Scale is used to measure the strength, or magnitude of an earthquake at its epicenter. While the magnitude of an earthquake measures the strength at its epicenter, intensity measures the strength of an earthquake at a given location, measured using the Mercalli Intensity Scale. The Richter Scale and Mercalli Intensity Scales are outlined in Table 3-32.43 Table 3-32: Richter Scale and Mercalli Intensity Scale Magnitude Mercalli Intensity Average Effects 1 I Microearthquakes not felt. 2 I Minor earthquakes felt slightly by some people. 3 II to III Minor earthquake often felt by people but rarely causes damage. 4 IV to V Light earthquake with noticeable shaking of indoor objects but little damage. 5 VI to VII Moderate earthquake felt by everyone and can damage poorly constructed buildings. 6 VII to IX Strong earthquake that can cause damage to well-constructed buildings. 7 VIII or greater Damages most buildings, some of which partially or completely collapse. 8 VIII or greater Major damage to buildings. Structures likely to be destroyed. 9 VIII or greater Permanent changes in ground topography. Severe damage or collapse to all buildings. 43 Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, Magnitude/Intensity, no date. Retrieved https://pnsn.org/outreach/about- earthquakes/magnitude-intensity AECOM 49Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Previous Occurrences There was an earthquake recorded in the south-central portion of the City of Revere near the Boston line on August 6, 1978. This earthquake was recorded as having a magnitude of 1.8. Historical records of some of the more significant earthquakes in the region are shown in Table 3-33.

Significant earthquake AECOM 50Hazard Mitigation Plan Update events in Revere are considered a “Very Low” frequency event that have a typical recurrence interval of greater than 100-years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of an earthquake occurring in Revere is less than 1-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Earthquakes can cause damage to buildings and infrastructure. Non-reinforced masonry is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. While the likelihood of a severe earthquake impacting Revere is low, the entire City is vulnerable to earthquakes. 3.3.5 Technological and Human-Caused Hazards Dam failure is a common technological hazard that is relevant in hazard mitigation plans as the consequence of a dam failure is flooding. However, there are no dams in the City, so this hazard is not profiled. 3.3.5.1 Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is not expected to impact the frequency or severity of earthquakes. 3.4 Community Assets and NFIP Insured Structures B4. Does the Plan address NFIP insured structures within the jurisdiction that have been repetitively damaged by floods? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(ii)) Residents of Revere have received 1,002 NFIP payouts since 1978 from 303 flood damaged structures. NFIP payouts aggregate to $18.9 million in 2021 dollars, resulting in an average of $18,900 per payout. There are 301 repetitive loss properties in Revere. Of the 301 repetitive loss properties in Revere, 296 are residential (172 are single family residences) and five are non-residential properties. In total, four flood-prone structures in Revere have been bought out using HMA funding. 3.5 Risk Analysis and Loss Estimation The Risk Analysis and Loss Estimation describes each hazard’s impact on the community, as well as an overall summary of the community’s vulnerability pursuant to 44 CFR § 201.6 (c) (2) (ii). The findings of the Risk Analysis and Loss Estimation conducted for this update, which utilized data from FEMA’s National Risk Index (NRI), suggest that the City is most vulnerable to extreme temperatures, hurricanes and tropical storms, severe winter storms, tornadoes, and earthquakes, based on the exposed population. However, the Risk Rating, which includes a qualitative assessment of the estimated annual losses, identified inland flooding as being the greatest risk to the City at large. The NRI was leveraged to estimate the potential for negative impacts resulting from natural hazards profiled in this Risk and Vulnerability Assessment. The NRI represents the potential for negative impacts resulting from natural hazards, including estimated monetary damages.44 Table 3-34 summarizes the Risk Analysis and Annual Loss Estimation, as summarized by the NRI with the following exceptions.45 • According to NRI data, population affected for hazards with city-wide population exposure varied between 45,000 and 52,000. These estimates were replaced with the latest population estimate of 54,000, as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. 44 Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Risk Index Technical Documentation, July 2021.

AECOM 51Hazard Mitigation Plan Update • NRI data estimated annual loss of $13.0 million from tornadoes in Revere. Because the 2014 tornado that caused $4.0 million in damages is the only recorded tornado event in 66 years of record keeping, the estimated annual loss of $13.0 million was re-estimated by assuming the 2014 tornado had a return period between 10 and 100 years (after adjusting previous damages to 2021 dollars). The estimated annual loss and risk ratings reported in Table 3-34 were sourced from the NRI. However, community input received during the planning process indicated that the estimated annual loss and risk ratings may be under-estimated for some hazards. The Massachusetts Coastal Flood Risk Model and the FEMA-delineated SFHA suggest the NRI’s estimated annual loss and risk ratings for coastal flooding and hurricanes/tropical storms under-estimate the risk they present to the City. The City’s extensive record of winter storms and the New England region’s reputation for nor’easters suggests that severe winter storms are a regular occurrence, and that the City’s risk is also under-estimated by the NRI.

Is there a description of each identified hazard’s impact on the community as well as an overall summary of the community’s vulnerability for each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(ii)) Pursuant to 44 CFR § 201.6 (c) (2) (ii), the Vulnerability Summary describes Revere’s vulnerability to the hazards profiled in the Risk and Vulnerability Assessment. The Vulnerability Summary includes an overall summary of each hazard and its impact on the community. FEMA defines vulnerability as the susceptibility of people, property, industry, resources, ecosystems, or historical buildings and artefacts to the negative impact of a disaster. The purpose of the vulnerability assessment is to estimate the extent of potential damages from natural hazards of varying types and intensities. The natural hazard exposure values provided in Table 3-34 monetize vulnerability to natural hazards at a high level. A qualitative summary of impacts and vulnerability resulting from each hazard profiled is provided in Table 3-35, organized by climate change interactions. Table 3-35: Summary of Impacts and Vulnerability Hazard (grouped by climate Impacts Vulnerability change interaction) Changes in Precipitation Inland Flooding - Damage to buildings and - Low-lying areas infrastructure Land in the SFHA - West/North Revere - Sales Creek area Drought - Agricultural production and - Residents on private water supply water access (not a concern in Revere) Landslides Damage to buildings and - Entire City infrastructure Sea Level Rise Coastal Flooding - Damage to buildings and - Low-lying coastal areas infrastructure - Beachmont - Point of Pines/Riverside - Oak Island/Revere Beach Coastal Erosion - Increases vulnerability of - Residents adjacent to coastline residents further from to coast to coastal flooding Tsunamis - Damage to buildings and - Residents adjacent to coastline infrastructure Rising Temperatures Extreme Temperatures - Public health - Entire city - Access to lifeline utilities such - Emphasis on low-income and elderly as electricity and potable water residents Wildfires - Damage to buildings - Residents most adjacent to shrubland and MBTA lands AECOM 53Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Hazard (grouped by climate Impacts Vulnerability change interaction) Invasive Species - Rarely impact humans directly - Entire City Extreme Weather Hurricanes/Tropical Storms - Damage to buildings and - Entire City is vulnerable to hurricane infrastructure winds - Low-lying coastal areas are most vulnerable to storm surge Severe Winter Storms - Inhibit travel - Entire city - Power outages - Emphasis on low-income and elderly - Structure fires residents Tornadoes - Damage to buildings and - Entire City infrastructure Non-Climate Influenced Hazards Earthquakes - Damage to buildings and - Entire City infrastructure In the 2015 Update, a vulnerability assessment and estimation of damages was performed for hurricanes, earthquakes, and flooding. HAZUS-MH (multiple hazards) software was used to estimate damages from hurricane winds and earthquakes, using the current version at the time of the latest analysis in April 2011, using 2000 Census Data. The methodology for flooding was developed specifically to address the issue in many of the communities where flooding was not solely related to location within the FEMA-delineated Special Flood Hazard Area. 3.6.1.1 Introduction to HAZUS-MH HAZUS-MH is a computer program developed by FEMA to estimate losses resulting from a variety of natural hazards. The following overview of HAZUS-MH is taken from the FEMA website. For more information on the HAZUS-MH software, go to FEMA’s HAZUS-MH website. • “HAZUS-MH is a nationally standardized risk modeling methodology. It is distributed as free Geographic information system (GIS)-based desktop software with a collection of inventory databases for every U.S. state and territory. HAZUS-MH identifies areas with high risk for natural hazards and estimates physical, economic, and social impacts of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tsunamis. The HAZUS-MH Program, managed by FEMA’s Natural Hazards Risk Assessment Program, partners with other federal agencies, research institutions, and regional planning authorities to ensure HAZUS-MH resources incorporate the latest scientific and technological approaches and meet the needs of the emergency management community. • HAZUS-MH is used for mitigation, recovery, preparedness, and response. Mitigation planners, GIS specialists, and emergency managers use HAZUS-MH to determine potential losses from disasters and to identify the most effective mitigation actions for minimizing those losses. HAZUS-MH supports the risk assessment requirement in the mitigation planning process. Response planners use HAZUS- MH to map potential impacts from catastrophic events and identify effective strategies for response and preparedness. HAZUS-MH is also used during real-time response efforts to estimate impacts from incoming storms or ongoing earthquake sequences.” There are three modules included with the HAZUS-MH software: hurricane wind, flooding, and earthquakes. There are also three levels at which HAZUS-MH can be run. Level 1 uses national baseline data and is the quickest way to begin the risk assessment process. The analysis that follows was completed using Level 1 data. AECOM 54Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Level 1 relies upon default data on building types, utilities, transportation, etc. from national databases as well as census data. While the databases include a wealth of information on the City of Revere, it does not capture all relevant information. In fact, the HAZUS-MH training manual notes that the default data is “subject to a great deal of uncertainty.” However, for the purposes of this plan, the analysis is useful. This plan is attempting to indicate the possible extent of damages due only generally to certain types of natural disasters and to allow for a comparison between different types of disasters. Therefore, this analysis should be a starting point for understanding potential damages from the hazards. 3.6.1.2 Revisions Since 2015 Update While an additional HAZUS-MH analysis was not completed for this update, the results of the 2011 HAZUS-MH analysis were adjusted to reflect population growth and inflation. Methods used to update damage estimates are described under each respective hazard. It was assumed the 2011 HAZUS-MH analysis used 2000 US Census data and that all monetized damages were in 2002 dollars. 3.6.2 Estimated Damages from Hurricane Wind The HAZUS-MH software was used to model potential damages to the community from a 100 -year and 500-year hurricane event; storms that are 1.0% and 0.2% likely to happen each year and roughly equivalent to a Category 2 and Category 4 hurricane. The damages caused by these hypothetical storms were modeled as if the storm track passed directly through the City, resulting in the strongest winds and greatest damage potential from hurricane winds. Though there are no recorded instances of a hurricane equivalent to a 500-year storm passing through Massachusetts, this model was included to present a reasonable “worst case scenario” that would help planners and emergency personnel evaluate the impacts of storms that might be more likely in the future, as we enter a period of more intense and frequent storms. 3.6.2.1 Methods to Update Damage Estimates The estimated number of buildings damaged was escalated by 14 percent proportionate to the City’s population growth since 2000. The estimated total building replacement value was escalated by 14 percent commensurate with the increase in estimated total number buildings; this dollar value was then adjusted to 2021 dollars using the White House Office of Management and Budget Gross Domestic Product and Deflators. Similarly, the tonnage of building debris generated and number of truckloads to clear building debris were escalated by 14 percent; tree debris generated was not adjusted under the assumption that tree canopy coverage is independent of population growth. Total property damage and total losses due to business interruption were escalated by 14 percent and then adjusted to 2021 dollars. A summary of estimated damages from hurricane winds is provided in Table 3-36.

For the purposes of this plan, two earthquakes were selected: magnitude 5.0 and a magnitude 7.0. Historically, major earthquakes are rare in New England, though a magnitude 5 event occurred in 1963. The estimated total number of buildings, buildings sustaining damage, households displaced, number of people seeking shelter, building debris generated, and number of truckloads to clear building debris were escalated by 14 percent, proportionate to population growth. Estimated building replacement value, property damage, and losses due to business interruption were escalated by 14 percent commensurate with population growth and then adjusted to 2021 dollars. Tree debris generated was not adjusted under the assumption that tree canopy coverage is independent of population growth. A summary of estimated damages from earthquakes is provided in Table 3-37. Table 3-37: Estimated Damages from Earthquakes 100-Year 500-Year (5.0 magnitude) (7.0 magnitude) Building Characteristics Estimated total number of buildings 15,142 15,142 Estimated total building replacement value (in $M) $5,616 $5,616 Building Damages # of buildings sustaining slight damage 2,550 1,180 # of buildings sustaining moderate damage 915 4,385 # of buildings sustaining extensive damage 156 4,304 # of buildings completely damaged 20 5,121 Population Needs AECOM 56Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 100-Year 500-Year (5.0 magnitude) (7.0 magnitude) # of households displaced 245 11,220 # of people seeking public shelter 162 7,415 Debris Building debris generated 34,066 1,044,702 Tree debris generated 18,000 543,000 # of truckloads to clear building debris 1,363 41,743 Value of Damages (millions of dollars) Total property damage $324.0 $4,810.1 Total losses due to business interruption $31.8 $836.0 3.6.4 Estimated Damages from Flooding HAZUS-MH was not used to estimate damages from flooding in Revere. In addition to technical difficulties with the software, the riverine module is not a reliable indicator of flooding in areas where inadequate drainage systems contribute to flooding even when those structures are not within a mapped flood zone. In lieu of using HAZUS-MH, a separate methodology was developed to give a rough approximation of flood damages. Revere covers 10 square miles or 6,400 acres. Local officials have identified approximately 397 acres in Revere as vulnerable to flooding, amounting to approximately 6.2 percent of the land area in Revere. The number of structures in each flood area was estimated by applying the percentage of the total land area to the number of structures (previously assumed to be 13,335, this number was escalated to 15,142 proportionate to population growth between 2000 and 2021) in Revere; the same number of structures used by HAZUS-MH for the hurricane and earthquake calculations. The HAZUS-MH analysis described in the previous update used a value of $257,200 (2002 dollars) which was adjusted to 2021 dollars, resulting in an updated building replacement value of $370,900. This was used to calculate the total building replacement value in each of the flood areas. Low damage estimates were assumed to be 10 percent of the building replacement value while high damage estimates were assumed to be 50 percent of the building replacement values, as suggested in the FEMA September 2002 publication, “State and Local Mitigation Planning how-to guides” (Page 4-13). These calculations are not based solely on location within the floodplain or a particular type of storm. A summary of estimated damages from flooding is provided in Table 3-38.

Hazard Mitigation Strategy This chapter provides Revere’s blueprint for reducing the potential losses identified in the Risk Assessment, based on existing authorities, policies, programs, and resources, and its ability to expand on and improve these existing tools. This strategy was developed using the findings of the Planning Process and Risk Assessment. The hazard mitigation strategy is made up of the following elements: • Mitigation Goals: General guidelines that represent visions for reducing or avoiding losses from the identified hazards. • Mitigation Actions: Specific projects and activities that work towards achieving mitigation goals. • Action Plan: Explains how mitigation actions will be prioritized, administered, and incorporated into the community’s existing planning mechanisms. Hazard mitigation actions eliminate or reduce long-term risk to people and property from future disasters and differ from actions taken to prepare for or respond to hazard events. Potential long-term strategies include planning, policy changes, programs, projects, and other activities. FEMA currently has the following three HMA programs that provide funding for mitigation activities: • Hazards Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) • Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) – previously known as Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) • Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Hazard mitigation actions can generally be sorted into the following groups: • Local Plans and Regulations: Include land-use policies or codes that influence the way land and buildings are developed and built. • Structure and Infrastructure Projects: Involve modifying existing structures and infrastructure to lessen exposure to a hazard or remove them from a hazard area. • Natural Systems Protection: Actions that minimize damage and losses and preserve or restore the functions of natural systems. • Education and Awareness Programs: Actions inform and educate stakeholders about potential hazards and opportunities to mitigate their impacts. The Hazard Mitigation Strategy begins with the City’s Capability Assessment, which identifies existing authorities, policies, programs, and resources and its ability to expand on and improve existing policies and programs. Because natural disasters, particularly large-scale, are not typically limited to a single jurisdiction, the Capability Assessment continues with a review of Regional and Inter-Community Considerations. The Capability Assessment concludes with a summary of Revere’s participation in the NFIP. 4.1 Capability Assessment C1. Does the plan document each jurisdiction’s existing authorities, policies, programs, and resources and its ability to expand on and improve these existing policies and programs? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)) AECOM 59Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 4.1.1 Overview of Existing Authorities, Policies, Programs, and Resources Performing a Capability Assessment is one step of a successful hazard mitigation plan update process. A mitigation planning Capability Assessment consists of taking an in-depth look at existing community resources (such as plans, codes, ordinances, staffing, etc.) to assess which capabilities contribute to vulnerability by reducing or exacerbating disaster impacts. Understanding what capabilities need to be changed or enhanced to reduce disaster losses allows the planning team to address those shortfalls in the mitigation strategy. Performing the Capability Assessment helps communities identify the regulatory, administrative, technical, and fiscal capacities and capabilities of their jurisdiction and consider ways that these existing tools can be used to further their hazard mitigation and disaster resiliency goals. The City of Revere completed its first Capability Assessment in 2021, guided by AECOM Technical Services, Inc. (AECOM) and the process outlined in FEMA’s Local Mitigation Planning Handbook. A virtual meeting was held on April 8, 2021. Attendees included representatives from AECOM and City Planning. AECOM provided background information on the Capability Assessment process (its purpose and benefits), presented an overview of the worksheet content, and then began to assist the City with documenting its responses. Time did not allow for the assessment to be completed during the time allotted for the virtual meeting; therefore, City Planning coordinated the completion of the balance of the assessment. The worksheet used to conduct the Capability Assessment consisted of Worksheet 4.1 from FEMA’s Local Mitigation Planning Handbook. As part of this assessment and as recommended in the Handbook, the City also conducted a Safe Growth Audit and an assessment of its NFIP participation. Safe Growth Audits allow communities to further evaluate the ways that their existing policies, ordinances, and plans are driving growth and how risks may be increasing under these current conditions. The Safe Growth Audit completed by the City of Revere is documented on Worksheet 4.2 of FEMA’s Local Mitigation Planning Handbook. As a participant in FEMA’s NFIP since 1974, the City of Revere has inherently developed and enhanced its local capabilities in terms of flood mitigation. As part of its Capability Assessment the City evaluated its participation in the NFIP and ways that they will continue to comply with the program’s requirements in the future. To facilitate this portion of the assessment, the City completed Worksheet 4.3 from FEMA’s Local Mitigation Planning Handbook. AECOM has summarized the City’s worksheet responses in this plan section, describing local activities currently reported to be underway which contribute to, or can be utilized for, hazard mitigation. The City of Revere has used this assessment process as a tool for informing its mitigation strategy, to be sure that proposed projects, funding streams, and timeframes for completion align with local resources, abilities, and limitations. State and Federal resources (such as technical assistance, funding streams, etc.) can also be used by local communities like Revere to supplement and enhance resources available at the local level. These outside resources, as related to hazard mitigation, are summarized at the end of this section. 4.1.2 Capabilities and Resources – City of Revere 4.1.2.1 Planning and Regulatory The City of Revere has several policies, programs, and capabilities which help to prevent and minimize future damages resulting from hazards (Table 4-1). These tools are valuable instruments in pre- and post- disaster mitigation as they facilitate the implementation of mitigation activities through the City’s current legal and regulatory framework. AECOM 60Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Table 4-1: Policies, Programs, and Capabilities to Prevent and Minimize Future Damages Plans Yes/No Does the plan address hazards? Year Does the plan identify projects to include in the mitigation strategy? Can the plan be used to implement mitigation actions? Comprehensive/Master Yes The City’s Master Plan does not address hazards. Plan 2020 Resiliency is discussed in the plan, but the plan does not identify specific projects that could be included in the mitigation strategy. The City feels that the Master Plan could be used to advocate for project grants, but that it could not be used directly to implement mitigation actions. Additionally, the City’s Riverfront Master Plan (2021) includes stormwater management and coastal resiliency. It addresses improvements for the Point of Pines area pump station, generator, and other electronic improvements. Check valves in the outfalls are also under contract for design (as of April 2021). Capital Improvements Plan No Economic Development Yes, this is The economic development component of the City’s Master Plan does Plan included not address hazards. as a Resiliency is discussed, but the plan does not identify specific projects component that could be included in the mitigation strategy. of the Master The City does not feel that the economic development component of the Plan City’s Master Plan could be used to implement mitigation actions.

Other special plans (e.g., Yes The City’s MVP Plan: brownfields redevelopment, Addresses hazards disaster recovery, coastal zone management, climate Includes projects that could be incorporated into the HMP mitigation change adaptation) strategy. Could be used to implement mitigation actions Additionally, the City completed a coastal resiliency study for the Riverside/Point of Pines area. The City was also awarded another MVP Grant to prepare plans for shoreline restoration in the Riverside Area, and a subsurface water retention at Gibson Park study is currently ongoing. The City’s Open Space and Recreation Plan: Addresses hazards? Minimal Includes projects that could be incorporated into the HMP mitigation strategy? Yes Could be used to implement mitigation actions? Yes Noted Pages 72-78 4.1.2.2 Administrative and Technical The ability of a local government to develop and implement mitigation projects, policies, and programs is contingent upon its staff and resources. Administrative capability is determined by evaluating whether there are an adequate number of personnel to complete mitigation activities. Similarly, technical capability can be evaluated by assessing the level of knowledge and technical expertise of local government employees, such as personnel skilled in surveying and Geographic Information Systems. Table 4-2 provides a summary of the administrative and technical capabilities currently in place for Revere. Table 4-2: Administrative and Technical Capabilities Administration Yes/No Describe capability Is coordination effective? Planning Commission Yes- the The City of Revere Planning Board consists of nine board members. The City has a Planning Board works with the City Planning Department to provide advice Planning on various matters before the City (such as zoning, subdivisions, master Board plans, etc.). Yes, the City feels that coordination between the Planning Department and Planning Board is effective. Mitigation Planning Yes The City has had a mitigation planning committee since the inception of its Committee mitigation planning program in 2010. While there is always some staff turnover over time, many of the same people have served on the committee since its inception, offering great institutional knowledge. Yes, the City feels that coordination is effective. AECOM 62Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Administration Yes/No Describe capability Is coordination effective? Maintenance programs Yes The City noted that its Department of Public Works (DPW) does undertake to reduce risk (e.g., tree maintenance programs such as tree trimming, and clearing of drainage trimming, clearing systems, which serve to reduce risk. drainage systems) The City’s new Water/Sewer/Drain department provides increased capacity for the City to handle issues such as drainage system clearing. Yes, the City feels that coordination is effective. Mutual aid agreements Yes – The City of Revere Fire Department has entered into mutual aid re: Fire agreements with neighboring municipalities for fire support. Department Yes, the City feels that coordination is effective. Staff Yes/No Is staffing adequate to enforce regulations? Is staff trained on FT/ PT1 hazards and mitigation? Is coordination between agencies and staff effective? Chief Building Official Yes Yes, the City feels that staffing is presently adequate to enforce FT regulations. Yes, the City feels that its staff is adequately trained on hazards and mitigation. Yes, the City feels that coordination between agencies and staff is effective. Floodplain Administrator Yes No, the City does not feel that staffing is presently adequate to enforce FT regulations. Yes, the City feels that its staff is adequately trained on hazards and mitigation. Yes, the City feels that coordination between agencies and staff is effective. Emergency Manager Yes No, the City does not feel that staffing is presently adequate to enforce FT regulations. Yes, the City feels that its staff is adequately trained on hazards and mitigation. Yes, the City feels that coordination between agencies and staff is effective. Community Planner Yes Yes, the feel that staffing is presently adequate to enforce regulations, but FT that additional staff would be beneficial. Yes, the City feels that its staff is adequately trained on hazards and mitigation. Yes, the City feels that coordination between agencies and staff is effective. Civil Engineer Yes No, the City does not feel that staffing is presently adequate to enforce FT regulations. Yes, the City feels that its staff is adequately trained on hazards and mitigation. Yes, the City feels that coordination between agencies and staff is effective. The City Engineer is on the site plan review committee so there is good coordination on new developments. AECOM 63Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Staff Yes/No Is staffing adequate to enforce regulations? Is staff trained on FT/ PT1 hazards and mitigation? Is coordination between agencies and staff effective? GIS Coordinator Yes N/A – GIS staff does not have a role in regulation enforcement. PT No, the City GIS Coordinator is not trained on hazards and mitigation. The City feels that coordination between GIS and other departments is something that could be improved. Other Yes The City DPW has recently added a new full-time position, “Chief of DPW-new Infrastructure”. This has improved coordination both within the City (i.e., FT position site plan review) and externally (i.e., between the City and other outside agencies). The City of Revere does not have a conservation agent to enforce wetlands bylaws; this position would be very beneficial as most of the City’s new development is in the floodplain. The City also has created North Suffolk Office of Resiliency and Sustainability, a regional office between Revere, Chelsea, and Winthrop. Two new positions will be filled before the HMP is adopted. One person for resiliency, and one for sustainability. These two new positions are shared across all three member municipalities. Both of these positions are full-time, but each person is only 1/3 dedicated to Revere. The City Engineer completed Illicit Discharge & Detection Elimination training in 2021. The City recently added the position of Open Space and Environmental Planner / Resiliency Coordinator; this is a full-time position. Overall, regarding the other staff capabilities discussed here: No, staffing is still not deemed to be adequate to properly enforce existing regulations. Staff would benefit from additional hazards and mitigation training. Yes, coordination is deemed to be effective. Additional technical capacities are summarized in Table 4-3. Table 4-3: Additional Technical Capacities Technical Yes/No Describe capability Has capability been used to assess/mitigate risk in the past? Warning systems/services Yes We have robo call via 311 system for emergency alerts. Digital sign (Reverse 911, outdoor warning boards are also used for emergencies signals) Hazard data and information Yes Gages for the water elevation at Oak Island Marsh. We do not have data captured for general storm or tide levels that cause floods. We need capacity for this data collection. Grant writing Yes Limited capacity; only .5 staff dedicated to resiliency. HAZUS-MH analysis No Other How can these capabilities be expanded and improved to reduce risk? AECOM 64Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Technical Yes/No Describe capability Has capability been used to assess/mitigate risk in the past? Additional staff is needed to supplement access to hazard data, support grant writing, and provide informational materials to residents regarding flood risk and flood proofing measures. 4.1.2.3 Financial The ability of a local government to implement mitigation activities is directly associated with the funding it has at its disposal. Funding for hazard mitigation initiatives is often locally based revenue and financing, supplemented by outside grants. Costs associated with mitigation activities range from staffing and administrative costs to the actual cost of the mitigation project. Table 4-4 provides a summary of the fiscal capabilities currently in place in the City of Revere. Table 4-4: Fiscal Capacity for the City of Revere Funding Resource Access/ Has the funding resource been used in past and Eligibility for what type of activities? (Yes/No) Could the resource be used to fund future mitigation actions? Capital improvements project funding No At this time Revere must complete the Hazard Mitigation plan to be eligible for federal funding. Yes, Revere is eligible for state funding via MVP since the MVP designation in 2019. Authority to levy taxes for specific purposes No Fees for water, sewer, gas, or electric Yes Water and Sewer Enterprise fund is used for drainage services improvements. Impact fees for new development Yes Community Improvement Trust Fund Storm water utility fee No Incur debt through general obligation bonds Yes Revere has an excellent bond rating and/or special tax bonds Incur debt through private activities No Community Development Block Grant Yes The City has obtained $780,000 Other federal funding programs Yes ACOE, FEMA State funding programs Yes Coastal Zone Management -coastal Resiliency program Other How can these capabilities be expanded and improved to reduce risk? Additional staff to support for state/federal funding grant programs. Education and Outreach Successful development and implementation of local mitigation initiatives involves significant education and outreach programs delivered to the public and other key stakeholders within the community. As part of its Capability Assessment, the City of Revere has evaluated education and outreach programs and AECOM 65Hazard Mitigation Plan Update methods already in place that could be used to implement mitigation activities and communicate hazard- related information. Table 4-5 provides a summary of the City’s education and outreach capabilities. Table 4-5: City of Revere Education and Outreach Capabilities Program/Organization Yes/No Describe program/organization and how relates to disaster resilience and mitigation. Could the program/organization help implement future mitigation activities? Local citizen groups or non-profit Yes Alliance for Health and the Environment organizations focused on environmental Beechmont Improvement Committee protection, emergency preparedness, access, and functional needs populations, Point of Pines Beach Association etc. Riverside Neighbourhood Group Ongoing public education or information Yes Stakeholder engagement process used for each hazard program (e.g., responsible water use, fire mitigation plan update as well as the City’s participation safety, household preparedness, in the MVP program. environmental education) Natural disaster or safety related school Yes The Revere Public Schools has emergency plans in programs place that are implemented during natural and human- caused hazard events. The emergency plans can be used to communicate hazard-related information. Storm Ready certification In Scheduling certification requirements progress Firewise Communities certification No Public-private partnership initiatives No addressing disaster-related issues Other The city will seek certifications for Firewise community and storm ready certification. In addition, Revere, Chelsea and Winthrop are in collaboration as part of the North Suffolk Office of Resiliency and Sustainability and we have begun discussions regarding opportunities for educating the public about the risks of climate change and sea level rise via regional community forums. Safe Growth Audit The FEMA Local Mitigation Planning Handbook indicates that one way to assess the impact of planning and regulatory capabilities is to complete a safe growth audit. The purpose of the safe growth audit is to analyze the impacts of current policies, ordinances, and plans on community safety from hazard risks due to growth. The City of Revere conducted its Safe Growth Audit using the Handbook’s Worksheet 4.2. The City’s assessments are summarized in Table 4-6. Table 4-6: City of Revere Safe Growth Audit Comprehensive Plan Yes No Land Use 1. Does the future land-use map clearly identify natural hazard areas? X 2.

Acquisition of land for open Yes The City of Revere does not have a specific ordinance regarding space and public recreation uses acquisition of land for open space and public recreation uses; however, while not an ordinance, its Open Space and Recreation Plan does address this issue. Along the Route 1A corridor there is a plan to acquire land for marsh restoration, it’s not specifically for open space and public recreation but it is for flood protection. This is in the MVP and in the MPL as well and referenced in the Riverfront Master Plan. Other None How can these capabilities be expanded and improved to reduce risk? The City’s planning and regulatory capabilities could be expanded/improved to reduce risk in the following ways: The next update of the Master Plan could be expanded to incorporate natural hazards and mitigation principles. Continued Compliance with the NFIP The City of Revere has participated in FEMA’s NFIP since 1972. With direct participation from its Floodplain Administrator (Frank Stringi, Chief Planner and Zoning Coordinator, Office of Strategic Planning and Economic Development), the City has collected information on its participation in, and continued compliance with, the NFIP and has identified areas for improvement that could be potential mitigation actions. The City’s assessments are summarized in Table 4-8.

Additionally, as part of this Capability Assessment, the City of Revere also considered ways of improving or enhancing their capabilities to achieve better alignment with the City’s long-term mitigation goals. Like many communities in Massachusetts and across the nation, the City of Revere generally finds its most significant resource constraints to be related to staffing and funding. Some intermunicipal agreements have allowed the City to supplement its core staff with shared services or shared staff members with its neighboring jurisdictions. While this approach has helped, City staff responsibilities still tend to exceed available time constraints. With regard to financial constraints, the City’s funds are indeed limited, and its budget is tight; however, local officials actively pursue grant funding streams wherever possible to supplement project costs and stretch every tax dollar for the greatest benefit to the municipality. 4.1.3 Capabilities and Resources – Commonwealth of Massachusetts The 2018 SHMCAP includes a detailed evaluation of the State’s authorities, laws, policies, programs, staff, funding, and other resources available to the Commonwealth to support hazard mitigation and climate adaptation efforts. The Commonwealth has a long history of demonstrating its commitment to advancing risk reduction and resilience across the state. This encompasses a broad range of State- supported initiatives and activities that include a combination of outreach, training, technical assistance, funding, partnerships, regulatory codes and statutes, infrastructure projects, and other activities to increase statewide resilience. An overview of some key capabilities and resources are summarized in Table 4-10. For more details, interested persons should refer to the SHMCAP, Chapter 6, online at https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/09/17/SHMCAP-September2018-Chapter6.pdf. This capability assessment finds that the Commonwealth’s various departments collectively have a significant level of legal, technical, and fiscal tools and resources necessary for implementation of hazard mitigation strategies, and that many of these programs and initiatives can be used to support the activities of local municipalities. Excerpts from examples included in the SHMCAP are provided below. The State Plan should be referred to directly for more specifics (on the web at https://www.mass.gov/service- details/massachusetts-integrated-state-hazard-mitigation-and-climate-adaptation-plan). Table 4-10 provides an overview of key state capabilities and resources for mitigation. Table 4-10: Overview of Key State Capabilities and Resources for Mitigation Capability/Resource Description State Hazard Mitigation Team Actively manages a statewide program of hazard mitigation and climate adaptation through the development of legislative initiatives, multi-agency committees or councils, public/private partnerships, and/or other executive actions that promote hazard risk reduction and resilience. The SHMT consists of staff members employed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) and MEMA, who work full-time on hazard mitigation planning, grants management, and project management State Hazard Mitigation Plan The Commonwealth has maintained a FEMA- approved state hazard mitigation plan since 1986. The most recent update of the plan (the 2018 SHMCAP) incorporates climate adaptation. Local Hazard Mitigation and The Commonwealth supports local hazard mitigation and climate adaptation Climate Adaptation Planning planning by providing workshops and training, State planning grants, and other coordinated resource and capability development of local officials. AECOM 72Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Capability/Resource Description Municipal Vulnerability The Commonwealth provides support for cities and towns in Massachusetts to Preparedness (MVP) Grant begin or enhance the process of planning for resiliency to extreme weather Program and other natural or climate-related hazards. Under the MVP planning program, the Commonwealth awards funding to communities to complete vulnerability assessments and develop action-oriented resiliency plans. Capital Investment Plan This plan provides funding for the Commonwealth’s capital needs, with a critical new component of climate change preparedness and resiliency. Statewide Resilience Master Plan The SRMP identifies and addresses potential climate impacts to State facility (SRMP) assets. Coastal Resilience Grant Program This program funds the non-Federal match for NOAA Regional Coastal Resilience Grants and provides 50% of the non-Federal share of the costs of major local flood control projects developed in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). FEMA HMGP Grant Cost Share The State contributes funding toward FEMA HMGP grant cost share to offset Supplemental Funds local hazard mitigation project costs. From 1991 to 2018, the State contributed more than $27 million under this initiative. State Building Code The Commonwealth requires local governments to use a nationally applicable model building code that addresses natural hazards (including wind, flood, snow, seismic, and other hazards) as a basis for design and construction of new buildings and any State-sponsored mitigation projects. The 9th Edition of the State Building Code became effective October 20, 2017, and is based on modified versions of the 2015 International Codes (I-Codes), as published by the International Code Council (ICC). Under the 9th Edition, the design and construction of buildings and structures located in flood hazard areas must be in accordance with American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) standards, which are consistent with, and in some cases, exceed minimum NFIP requirements. The Commonwealth routinely The State’s Disaster Recovery Manager at the Massachusetts Emergency integrates risk reduction into its Management Agency (MEMA) also oversees the Mitigation Unit, providing post-disaster response and seamless coordination with the implementation of post-disaster mitigation and recovery operations recovery programs, including FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, PA program, and Individuals and Households Program. During Joint Field Office operations, the State Hazard Mitigation Officer is present for the duration of the recovery process. State Agency Partnerships and Some state agencies and offices routinely conduct hazard mitigation and Initiatives resilience building as part of their organizational missions. Executive Order 569 – Establishing This Executive Order, signed in September 2016, lays out a comprehensive an Integrated Climate Change approach to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions; safeguard residents, Strategy for the Commonwealth municipalities, and businesses from the impacts of climate change; and build a more resilient Commonwealth. Silver Jackets The goal of the Massachusetts Silver Jackets Team is to reduce the risk of flooding and other natural disasters by bringing together multiple federal and state agencies. The interagency team facilitates a collaborative process of strategic and integrated mitigation actions to reduce the threat, vulnerability, and consequences of flooding in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Massachusetts Executive Order Designates the Massachusetts Water Resources Commission as the state 149 (1978), State Coordination and agency to implement floodplain management programs in Massachusetts. The Participation with the Federal Office of Water Resources in DCR provides technical and staff support, Administration under the National including scientists, hydrogeologists, and water policy specialists who Flood Insurance Act undertake activities of the Commission. Massachusetts Executive Order To mitigate future loss of life and property, Executive Order 181 prohibited new 181 (1980), Barrier Beaches development in velocity zones or primary dunes, as well as seawalls and AECOM 73Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Capability/Resource Description revetments on barrier beaches. It constrains the use of state funds and federal grants for construction projects that could encourage growth and development in barrier beach areas. The Wetlands Protection Act (WPA) These regulations protect wetlands functions and their public interests, (Massachusetts General Laws including flood control, prevention of pollution and storm damage, and [MGL] Chapter 131, Section 40) protection of water supplies and other natural resources and habitats. was codified as 310 Code of Massachusetts Regulations (CMR) Section 10.00 Massachusetts Rivers Protection Enacted in 1996, the Massachusetts Rivers Protection Act amends the WPA Act to provide protection to rivers and implements hazard mitigation by regulating activities within a 200-foot-wide resource area called the Riverfront Area. StormSmart Coast This national model developed by CZM is designed to help communities and homeowners address coastal erosion, storm damage, flooding, and related issues. The StormSmart Coasts website includes information on available grants and on assessing the vulnerability of coastal properties to erosion and flooding; tools for local officials to improve coastal floodplain management; options for coastal property owners to effectively reduce erosion and storm damage while minimizing impacts to shoreline systems; landscaping options for controlling erosion and storm damage; interactive maps of erosion along the Massachusetts coast; and more Coastal Resilience Grant Program Program to provide financial and technical support to the Commonwealth’s Chapter 6: State Capability and Adaptive Capacity Analysis 6-10 Massachusetts 2018 SHMCAP September 2018 78 coastal communities and certified 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations with vulnerable coastal property for local efforts to increase awareness and understanding of climate impacts, identify and map vulnerabilities, conduct adaptation planning, redesign vulnerable public facilities and infrastructure, and implement nonstructural (or green infrastructure) approaches that enhance natural resources and provide storm damage protection. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Online tool to support the assessment of coastal flooding vulnerability and risk Flooding Viewer for community facilities and infrastructure. This viewer includes interactive maps of flooding extents and water level elevations associated with sea level rise scenarios, current coastal flood zones, and hurricane storm surge. It also includes location data for a wide range of public facilities and infrastructure. Coastal A Zone Mapping: To improve coastal flood hazard mapping in Massachusetts, DCR and CZM recently partnered to map the delineation of Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA) for 15 coastal communities. LiMWA is the inland limit of the area expected to receive 1.5-foot or greater breaking waves during the 1 percent annual chance flood event. FEMA FIRMs that went into effect in 2009-2013 for Massachusetts coastal counties were based on studies initiated in 2005 and did not include LiMWA lines. The addition of the LiMWA to FIRMs allows communities and individuals to better understand the flood risks to their property. T Increasing Resilience through Regional effort to increase resilience to sea level rise in New England that is Application of Nature-Based focused on increasing the effective use of nature-based infrastructure for Infrastructure reduced erosion and enhanced wave attenuation Energy Resilience Initiatives The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) develops and (various) implements policies and programs aimed at ensuring the adequacy, security, diversity, and cost-effectiveness of the Commonwealth's energy supply to create a clean, affordable, and resilient energy future for all residents, businesses, communities, and institutions.(See https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/09/17/SHMCAP-September2018- Chapter6.pdf for more information) AECOM 74Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Capability/Resource Description Transportation Resiliency Initiatives Various initiatives to enhance Massachusetts Department of Transportation’s (various) (MassDOT’s) climate preparedness and mitigation efforts to identify and adapt to climate-related threats to the State’s key transportation assets and infrastructure. Recovery Planning Initiative MEMA staff attends semi-annual Recovery and Mitigation meetings to discuss important aspects of the programs, changes in priorities, and lessons learned from disaster events. In addition, Mitigation staff provide support to the Recovery Unit during immediate post-disaster operations, such as attending applicants’ briefings for PA and other administrative duties. In 2018, the Commonwealth initiated the development of a new State Disaster Recovery Plan. 4.1.4 Capabilities and Resources – Federal The Federal government offers a wide range of funding and technical assistance programs that can be accessed by municipalities to foster local hazard mitigation initiatives and support community resiliency. Some of these programs are geared to disaster preparedness and mitigation planning, while the focus of others is the long-term vitality of the communities. Table 4-11 presents a summary of Federal funding sources available for mitigation activities. It should be emphasized that the capabilities and resources summarized in Table 4-11 present a high- level overview of some key resources that are most relevant to hazard mitigation and mitigation planning; it is not a comprehensive list. Further information on these and other Federal programs can be found in the Assistance Listings online at www.beta.sam.gov. This site allows users to browse federal assistance listings across all government agencies and download a copy of the latest Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. This capability assessment finds that the various Federal agencies collectively have a significant level of resources that support local implementation of hazard mitigation strategies and that can be accessed to support the activities of local municipalities. Table 4-11: Federal Funds Available for Mitigation Activities Funding Source Description Funding that Requires an Approved Hazard Mitigation Plan: Flood Mitigation Availability: Pre-disaster, annually Assistance Program Description: FMA provides funds for planning and projects to reduce or eliminate long- (FMA) term risk of flood damage to repetitive loss (RL) properties and severe repetitive loss (SRL) properties, including residential and non-residential structures insured under the NFIP. Hazard Mitigation Grant Availability: Post-Disaster; After FEMA disaster and emergency declarations Program (HMGP) Description: Following a Presidential major disaster declaration, the state receives 15% of the total federal share of the declared disaster damage amount to fund hazard mitigation plans and projects under the HMGP. HMGP funds projects in accordance with priorities identified in State, Tribal or local hazard mitigation plans, and enables mitigation measures to be implemented during the recovery from a disaster. The Federal government may fund up to 75 percent of total eligible project costs, with a 25 percent non-Federal match. Public Assistance Availability: Post-Disaster; After FEMA disaster and emergency declarations Program (PA) Mitigation AECOM 75Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Funding Source Description Description: Section 406 of the Stafford Act, provides funding for mitigation measures in conjunction with the repair of disaster-damaged public facilities. This allows the opportunity to maximize recovery dollars by building back stronger and more resilient, thus reducing potential damage in the future. Building Resilient Availability: Pre-disaster, annually Infrastructure and Description: Support for states, local communities, tribes, and territories as they Communities (BRIC) undertake hazard mitigation projects, reducing the risks they face from disasters and natural hazards. BRIC is a new FEMA pre-disaster hazard mitigation program that replaces the existing PDM program. Other Available Federal Funds for Mitigation Planning and Implementation: RiskMAP Availability: Pre-disaster Description: FEMA's Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning (RiskMAP) program provides high quality flood maps and information, tools to better assess the risk from flooding and planning and outreach support to communities to help them take action to reduce (or mitigate) flood risk. Each Risk MAP flood risk project is tailored to the needs of each community and may involve different products and services. National Flood Insurance Availability: Pre- or post-disaster Program (NFIP) Description: New York State Department of Environmental Conservation administers the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) within the State of New York. The office of the State NFIP Coordinator facilitates municipal participation in the NFIP; provides technical assistance, training, and support to local Floodplain Administrators on the minimum NFIP design standards; and encourages participation in the CRS program. FEMA Cooperating Availability: Pre-disaster Federal Partners (CTP) Description: FEMA's Cooperating Technical Partnership (CTP) Program was created to partner with communities, state or regional agencies, universities or Tribal nations to enhance hazard data in the creation of FIRMs and Digital FIRMs. DHSES intends to pursue this partnership in the future and enhance our awareness of and involvement in the RiskMAP process. Fire Management Availability: Post-disaster Assistance Grant Description: Assistance for the mitigation, management, and control of fires on publicly Program or privately-owned forests or grasslands, which threaten such destruction as would constitute a major disaster. Community Development Availability: Pre- or post-disaster Block Grant (CDBG) Description: Federal grant provided to Community Development Block Grant (CDBG and “entitlement communities” (typically, municipalities with populations over Community Development 50,000 and urban counties with populations over 200,000) and to all Block Grant – Disaster states. The CDBG and Community Development Block Grant- Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds are some of the limited number of federal grant funds that lose federal identity when it is allocated to the state and therefore can be used to assist with meeting the non-federal match for HMA grant programs. The 2019 New York State HMP notes that the State is using Hurricane Sandy CDBG-DR to assist with meeting non-federal match for several disasters, including Hurricane Sandy (DR-4085) HMGP projects. Reimbursement for Availability: Post-disaster Firefighting on Federal Description: Provides reimbursement only for direct costs and losses over and above Property normal operating costs National Dam Safety Availability: Pre-disaster Program Description: The National Dam Safety Program (NDSP) was formally established by the Water Resources and Development Act of 1996. Led by FEMA, the AECOM 76Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Funding Source Description NDSP is a partnership of the states, federal agencies, and other stakeholders to encourage individual and community responsibility for dam safety. Provides vital support for the improvement of the state dam safety programs that regulate most of the 79,500 dams in the United States. Land and Water Availability: To States, local and conservation organizations Conservation Fund Description: Funding for outdoor recreational development, renovation, land (LWCF) acquisition, and planning. The program is divided into two distinct funding pots: State grants, and Federal acquisition funds. The Forest Legacy Availability: Participation in Forest Legacy is limited to private forest landowners. Program (FLP) Description: Federal program in partnership with States, supports State efforts to protect environmentally sensitive forest lands. Designed to encourage the protection of privately-owned forest lands, FLP is an entirely voluntary program. To maximize the public benefits it achieves, the program focuses on the acquisition of partial interests in privately owned forest lands. FLP helps the States develop and carry out their forest conservation plans. It encourages and supports acquisition of conservation easements, legally binding agreements transferring a negotiated set of property rights from one party to another, without removing the property from private ownership. Most FLP conservation easements restrict development, require sustainable forestry practices, and protect other values. To qualify, landowners are required to prepare a multiple resource management plan as part of the conservation easement acquisition. The federal government may fund up to 75 percent of project costs, with at least 25 percent coming from private, State, or local sources. In addition to gains associated with the sale or donation of property rights, many landowners also benefit from reduced taxes associated with limits placed on land use. In 2008, NJ has one project funded: Sparta Mountain South at $2,474,000. Transportation Trust Availability: Pre- and post-disaster Fund (TTF) Description: Grants are funded by the TTF through a competitive application-based process administered by the Local Aid District Offices. The County Aid Program is funded through the TTF and provides funding for eligible costs of projects included in the County’s approved Annual Transportation Program. The program is intended for road and bridge infrastructure improvements under county jurisdiction. Each County receives an annual formula-based allotment that takes into consideration county road lane mileage and population. 4.1.4.1 Other Resources – Documents FEMA has developed many documents that address implementing hazard mitigation at the local level. Key resource documents are briefly described here. Local Mitigation Planning Handbook. This handbook is the official guide for local governments to develop, update and implement local mitigation plans. While federal requirements have not changed, the Handbook provides revised and expanded guidance, offering practical approaches, tools, worksheets, and local mitigation planning examples for how communities can engage in effective planning to reduce long-term risk from natural hazards and disasters. The Handbook can be found on the FEMA web site at: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/fema-local-mitigation-planning-handbook_03-2013.pdf Mitigation Ideas: A Resource for Reducing Risk to Natural Hazards. The purpose of this document is to provide a resource that communities can use to identify and evaluate a range of potential mitigation actions for reducing risk to natural hazards and disasters. The focus of this document is mitigation, which is action taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to hazards. Ideas for mitigation actions are presented AECOM 77Hazard Mitigation Plan Update for the following natural hazards: drought, earthquake, erosion, extreme temperatures, , flood, hail, landslide, lightning, sea level rise, severe wind, severe winter weather, storm surge, subsidence, tornado, tsunami, and wildfire. This resource can be found on the FEMA web site at: http://www.fema.gov/media- library-data/20130726-1904-25045-0186/fema_mitigation_ideas_final508.pdf Integrating Hazard Mitigation into Local Planning: Case Studies and Tools for Community Officials. The purpose of this document is to provide succinct and practical information to local government officials on how to best integrate hazard mitigation into the full range of community planning activities. It is intended for those who are engaged in any type of local planning, but primarily community planners and emergency managers that bear responsibility for hazard mitigation planning. This resource can be found on the FEMA web site at: http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1908-25045- 0016/integrating_hazmit.pdf How-to Guides. FEMA has developed a series of nine “how-to guides” to assist States, communities, and tribes in enhancing their hazard mitigation planning capabilities. The first four guides mirror the four major phases of hazard mitigation planning used in the development of the Rensselaer County Multi- Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan. The last five how-to guides address special topics that arise in hazard mitigation planning such as using benefit-cost analysis and integrating man-made hazards. The use of worksheets, checklists, and tables make these guides a practical source of guidance to address all stages of the hazard mitigation planning process. They also include special tips on meeting DMA 2000 requirements. Post-Disaster Hazard Mitigation Planning Guidance for State and Local Governments. FEMA, Disaster Assistance Policy (DAP)-12, September 1990. This handbook explains the basic concepts of hazard mitigation and shows State and local governments how they can develop and achieve mitigation goals within the context of FEMA’s post-disaster hazard mitigation planning requirements. The handbook focuses on approaches to mitigation, with an emphasis on multi-objective planning. Mitigation Resources for Success CD. FEMA 372, September 2001. This CD contains a wealth of information about mitigation and is useful for State and local government planners and other stakeholders in the mitigation process. It provides mitigation case studies, success stories, information about Federal mitigation programs, suggestions for mitigation measures to homes and businesses, appropriate relevant mitigation publications, and contact information. A Guide to Federal Aid in Disasters. FEMA 262, April 1995. When disasters exceed the capabilities of State and local governments, the President’s disaster assistance program (administrated by FEMA) is the primary source of Federal assistance. This handbook discusses the procedures and process for obtaining this assistance and provides a brief overview of each program. The Emergency Management Guide for Business and Industry. FEMA 141, October 1993. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to emergency management planning, response, and recovery. It also details a planning process that companies can follow to better prepare for a wide range of hazards and emergency events. This effort can enhance a company’s ability to recover from financial losses, loss of market share, damages to equipment, and product or business interruptions. This guide could be of great assistance to Rensselaer County industries and businesses located in hazard prone areas. 4.1.4.2 Other Resources - Websites The following are important websites that provide focused access to valuable planning resources for communities interested in sustainable development initiatives. • http://www.fema.gov: Web site of the Federal Emergency Management Agency includes links to information, resources, and grants that communities can use in planning and implementation of sustainable measures.

Online resources provide information on natural hazards, community land use, and ways you can protect your property from damage. 4.1.5 Regional and Inter-Community Considerations Some hazard mitigation actions are strictly local. The vulnerability being addressed is limited to the municipality and can be solved at the local level. Other mitigation actions address inter-community vulnerabilities that require cooperation between two or more municipalities in a local area. There is a third level of mitigation which is regional; involving a state, regional, or federal agency or an issue that involves numerous municipalities across a wide area of the metropolitan region. This section summarizes the City’s capacity and existing strategies to coordinate beyond the boundaries of Revere. 4.1.5.1 Regional Partners In many communities, mitigating natural hazards, particularly flooding, is more than a local issue. The drainage systems that serve these communities are a complex system of storm drains, roadway drainage structures, pump stations and other facilities owned and operated by a wide array of agencies including but not limited to the City of Revere, the DCR, and MassDOT. The planning, construction, operations, and maintenance of these structures are integral to the flood hazard mitigation efforts of communities. These agencies must be considered the communities regional partners in hazard mitigation. These agencies also operate under the same constraints as communities do, including budgetary and staffing constraints and numerous competing priorities. In the sections that follow, the plan includes recommendations for activities where cooperation with these other agencies may be necessary. Implementation of these recommendations will require that all parties work together to develop solutions. Also, Revere will continue to support and be involved with the following working groups to support regional climate change adaptation and hazard mitigation efforts: • Resilient Mystic Collaborative (Mystic River Watershed Association) • North Suffolk Office of Resiliency and Sustainability (Revere, Winthrop, and Chelsea) • Saugus Pines River Collaborative (Revere, Saugus, Lynn, Malden, and Everett) • Metro Mayors Climate Task Force (Metropolitan Planning Area Council) 4.1.5.2 Inter-Community Considerations North Revere Brush Fires: Plan participants identified regional brush fire prevention in North Revere, in collaboration with the Town of Saugus, as a natural hazard issue of regional concern. This is a salt marsh area bisected by the Pine River and State Route 107 (Salem Turnpike), and an MBTA commuter rail line. This area, bordered by Saugus and Revere are often the target for vandals setting brush fires, as well as prone to fires started by sparks from braking trains landing on dry salt marsh grasses. The two AECOM 79Hazard Mitigation Plan Update communities would like to cooperate to create public awareness of the problem, increase access to the marsh area and establish a cooperative mutual aid firefighting agreement to increase fire prevention and protection within North Revere and Saugus. Sea Level Rise and Shoreline Environment: The coastal shoreline of the North Shore area is a dynamic environment where forces of sea-level rise, erosion, and deposition of are constantly at work changing the shoreline profile. This process disregards municipal boundaries as sand and other materials are moved along the coast. Shoreline protection measures such as sea walls, jetties, and others have an impact on this process with the potential of building up materials in some areas while stripping it away from others. In Revere, a shoreline issue of regional concern is the need for additional storm water and storm surge storage capacity. Though the City has made substantial progress over the decade in updating its drainage and water infrastructure, the City has expressed the need for a regional approach to adding additional storm water storage capacity by dredging both Town Line Brook and Trifone Brooks. This additional capacity would benefit Everett, Malden and Chelsea, as well as Revere. Municipalities along the North Shore should work to understand how these processes and others associated with sea level rise and storm surge are at work locally and consider mutually beneficial means of protecting their shore side communities from the impacts of storm damage and sea-level rise. Revere should consider participating within a regional sea level rise action work group to help plan for and address sea level rise, storm surge and related climate adaptation issues on a regional basis. 4.1.6 Participation in the National Flood Insurance Program C2. Does the plan address each jurisdiction’s participation in the NFIP and continued compliance with NFIP requirements, as appropriate? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(ii)) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) – Revere is a participating community in the NFIP with 2,274 policies in force as of February 23, 2021. Since the 2015 Update, the policies in force have increased by 562. More information on NFIP claims and payouts in Revere can be found in Section 3.4. 4.2 Hazard Mitigation Goals C3. Does the Plan include goals to reduce/avoid long‐term vulnerabilities to the identified hazards? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(i)) The Planning Committee approved of the Hazard Mitigation Goals at the April 27, 2021 Planning Committee Meeting #2. At that meeting, the team reviewed and discussed the goals from the 2015 Hazard Mitigation Plan for the City of Revere and agreed to carry them forward in the 2022 Update. Table 4-12 presents the right goals that were endorsed by the Planning Committee for the 2022 Update of the Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan: Table 4-12: Hazard Mitigation Goals Number Description 1 Ensure that critical infrastructure sites are protected from natural hazards 2 Protect existing residential and business areas from flooding. 3 Make efficient use of public funds for hazard mitigation. 4 Continue to enforce zoning and building regulations. 5 Educate the public about zoning and building regulations, particularly with regard to changes in regulations that may affect teardowns and new construction. 6 Encourage future development in areas that are not prone to natural hazards. AECOM 80Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Number Description 7 Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures. 8 Protect the City's ability to respond to various natural hazard events. 4.3 Mitigation Actions C4. Does the Plan identify and analyze a comprehensive range of specific mitigation actions and projects for each jurisdiction being considered to reduce the effects of hazards, with emphasis on new and existing buildings and infrastructure? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(ii)) Table 4-14 identifies a comprehensive list of specific mitigation actions and projects within Revere that are being considered to reduce the effects of hazards, with an emphasis on the build environment, which includes new and existing buildings and infrastructure. D2. Was the plan revised to reflect progress in local mitigation efforts? (Requirement §201.6(d)(3)) At a meeting of Planning Committee, City staff reviewed the potential mitigation actions identified in the 2015 Update and determined whether each measure had been implemented or deferred, as displayed in Table 4-13. Mitigation actions from the 2015 Update, identified in Table 4-13, were updated to reflect progress in local mitigation efforts.

None) (Yes, No) 42 Implement drought tolerant Low Planning/ None No landscape design measures Conservation Commission 43 Development guidelines for green Low Planning/ Progress Made Yes buildings & parking Conservation Commission Of the mitigation actions that have been deferred, the Planning Committee evaluated whether the measure should be deleted or carried forward into the 2022 Update. The decision on whether to delete or retain a particular measure was based on the Planning Committee’s assessment of the continued relevance or effectiveness of the measure and whether the deferral of action on the measure was due to the inability of the City to take action on the measure. 4.3.1 Prioritization of Mitigation Actions C5. Does the Plan contain an action plan that describes how the actions identified will be prioritized (including cost benefit review), implemented, and administered by each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(iv)); (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(iii)) The last step in developing the City’s mitigation strategy is to assign a level of priority to each mitigation measure to guide the focus of the City’s limited resources towards those actions with the greatest potential benefit. At this stage in the process, the Planning Committee has limited access to detailed analyses of the cost and benefits of any given measure, so prioritization is based on the Planning Committee member’s institutional knowledge of the existing and potential hazard impacts and an approximate sense of the costs associated with pursuing any given measure. Prioritization occurred through discussion with the Planning Committee and through subsequent review by the Planning Committee members and public comment. Priority setting was based on local knowledge of the hazard areas, including impacts of hazard events and the extent of the area impacted and the relation of a given mitigation measure to the City’s identified goals. In addition, through the discussion, the Planning Committee also took into consideration factors such as the number of homes and businesses affected, whether or not road closures occurred and what impact closures had on delivery of emergency services and the local economy, anticipated project costs, whether the City currently had the technical and administrative capability to carry out the mitigation measures, whether any environmental constraints existed, and whether Revere would be able to justify the costs relative to the anticipated benefits. Table 4-14 reflects the prioritized mitigation actions and projects being considered by the City to reduce the effects of hazards.

Does the Plan describe a process by which local governments will integrate the requirements of the mitigation plan into other planning mechanisms, such as comprehensive or capital improvement plans, when appropriate? (Requirement §201.6(c)(4)(ii)) As stated in Section 2.2, the City recognizes hazard mitigation planning should not occur independent of other community planning activities. The City has held stakeholder workshops to support the Revere MVP Program and workshops specific to the Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study for the Point of Pines Riverside Area. Stakeholder engagement activities taken to support these efforts are summarized in the following sections. Many measures identified in previous plan updates are now considered on-going aspects of the regular work of City staff from the department head level to the regular work of Public Works staff. Individual projects have been incorporated into the City’s capital improvement plan and the City continues to seek FEMA HMA funding to implement the home elevation program. There will be more opportunities to incorporate hazard mitigation into the City’s decision-making processes. Barriers to implementing many mitigation actions are primarily a result of funding and staffing constraints. The following ongoing initiatives and planning mechanisms are integrating requirements of the mitigation plan to improve community resilience: • Coastal Resilience Study for Riverside and Point of Pines – MVP Action Grant • Suffolk Downs redevelopment Regional and Inter-Community Considerations are further discussed in Section 4.1.5. Lastly, the Planning Committee encompasses an interdisciplinary group of stakeholders from the City, and includes representation from first responders and emergency managers, planning and development, engineers and infrastructure operators, and the City’s school department. In addition, the Planning Committee includes stakeholder who represent community members with access and functional needs. Through encompassing an interdisciplinary set of stakeholders, the Planning Committee can integrate the findings of the risk assessment and mitigate strategy into other municipal plans and response procedures, where appropriate. AECOM 97Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 5. Plan Adoption and Maintenance The Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan was adopted by the City Council on [ADD DATE]. See Appendix C for documentation. The plan was approved by FEMA on [ADD DATE] for a five-year period that will expire on [ADD DATE]. 5.1 Public Participation during Plan Maintenance A5. Is there discussion of how the community(ies) will continue public participation in the plan maintenance process? (Requirement §201.6(c)(4)(iii)) Planning is a dynamic and ongoing process, and as such, the 2022 Update will be reviewed annually between formal approval and the beginning of the next update to internally review and update the hazard mitigation strategy / action status. The Planning Committee will morph into the Implementation Committee and will continue to meet on an annual basis to function as the Local Hazard Mitigation Implementation Committee, with the Emergency Management Director designated as the coordinator. Additional members could be added to the local implementation group from businesses, non-profits, and institutions. The City will continue public participation during the next 5-year planning cycle. Updates and reviews of the plan will be publicly noticed in accordance with City and state open meeting laws, and the current plan will be available to the public on the City's website. Furthermore, the 2022 Update will be posted on the City’s website, allowing for public review and comment throughout the plan’s 5-year lifecycle. 5.2 Keeping the Plan Current A6. Is there a description of the method and schedule for keeping the plan current (monitoring, evaluating and updating the mitigation plan within a 5‐year cycle)? (Requirement §201.6(c)(4)(i)) 5.2.1 Implementation and Maintenance Schedule The City will conduct annual plan maintenance meetings in the Fall to internally review and update the hazard mitigation strategy / action status. Furthermore, the coordinator of the Implementation Committee will prepare and distribute a survey in year three of the plan. The survey will be distributed to all the local implementation group members and other interested local stakeholders. The survey will poll the members on any changes or revisions to the plan that may be needed, progress and accomplishments for implementation, and any new hazards or problem areas that have been identified. This information will be reflected in the planning section of the subsequent plan update. The Implementation Committee will have primary responsibility for tracking progress and Planning Committee will again be responsible for subsequent updates of the plan. 5.2.2 Begin to Prepare for the next Plan Update Given the lead time needed to secure funding and conduct the planning process, the Planning Committee will begin to prepare for an update of the plan in year three. The Planning Committee will use the information collected during the annual review process to identify the needs and priorities for the next plan update and seek funding for the plan update process. Potential sources of funding may include FEMA HMA, which includes BRIC and HMGP funding. Both grant programs can pay for 75% of a planning project, with a 25% local cost share required. AECOM 98Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 5.2.3 Prepare and Adopt an Updated Local Hazard Mitigation Plan FEMA’s approval of this plan is valid for five years, by which time an updated plan must be approved by FEMA to maintain the City’s approved plan status and its eligibility for FEMA HMA. Once the resources have been secured for the next update, the Planning Committee will need to review the current FEMA hazard mitigation plan guidelines for any changes. The update of the Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan will then be forwarded to MEMA and DCR for review and to FEMA for approval. 5.2.4 Integration of the Plans with Other Planning Initiatives Upon FEMA approval and adoption of the 2022 Update, the Local Hazard Mitigation Implementation Committee will provide all interested parties and implementing departments with a copy of the plan and will initiate a discussion regarding how the plan can be integrated into that department’s ongoing work. Discussions will focus on how recommendations in the 2022 Update can be integrated into the City’s capital improvement planning program, master planning process, zoning, wetlands, and stormwater or subdivision regulations. At a minimum, the 2022 Update will be reviewed and discussed with the following departments: • Fire / Emergency Management • Police • Public Services / Highway • Engineering • Planning and Community Development • Conservation • Parks and Recreation • Health • Building The findings of the 2022 Update will be integrated into other city planning initiatives and policies as they are updated and renewed, including the Revere Comprehensive Plan, Open Space Plan, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, and Capital Investment Program. Other groups that will be coordinated with include large institutions, Chambers of Commerce, land conservation organizations and watershed groups. The plans will also be posted on a community’s website with the caveat that local team coordinator will review the plan for sensitive information that would be inappropriate for public posting. The posting of the plan on a web site will include a mechanism for citizen feedback such as an e-mail address to send comments. AECOM 99Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Appendix A Planning Process AECOMHMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Meeting Minutes Meeting name Meeting date Attendees Local Hazard Mitigation January 20, 2021 See Section 1.0 for Planning Committee attendee list Meeting #1 Time Location 2:00PM-4:00PM Virtual Zoom Meeting AECOM project number Prepared by 60648765 Aaron Weieneth Subject: Hazard Mitigation Plan Update – Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Meeting #1 1.0 Introductions • Attendees: AECOM: Amanda Shanahan, Aaron Weieneth, Anna Foley City of Revere: Elle Baker, Frank Stringi, James Cullen, Joe Maglione, Bob O’Brien, David Callahan • Elle Baker made introductions and turned things over to Aaron Weieneth for the formal presentation. A PDF of the presentation is attached to these notes and provides additional details. • Elle introduced the project, previous meeting items and actions. • Aaron Weieneth provided welcome and opening remarks to the group and proceeded to give an overview of HMP agenda and materials to be covered. 2.0 Importance of Hazard Mitigation Plan Update (Led by Anna Foley) • Anna Foley took over presentation and asked the group who has been involved in HMP planning before. ─ Elle indicated she had not been involved but works closely on the City’s related Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) work. Frank Stringi was involved with the previous HMP update. • Anna reviewed why hazard mitigation is important: combination of factors that dictate the degree of impact felt when a disaster occurs. • Hazard mitigation planning is the key to resiliency because natural hazards are inevitable. Communities need to have a well-rounded understanding of all vulnerabilities, not just the most recent events that have caused issues. This process will allow the City to make better informed decisions of how to allocate resources. • Hazard mitigation breaks the cycle of hazards becoming disasters. It reduces exposure, saves communities money, and protects property and lives. • In 2018, the Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council performed a study of cost-effective grant funded mitigation projects and found those projects provided towns with 6:1 cost savings. • Disaster Mitigation Act (2000) added a new requirement for local communities to have HMPs in place to be eligible to apply for federal hazard mitigation project grant money. Previously, the eligibility requirement was tied to the State having a mitigation plan in place. • HMPs are living documents and need to be continually updated on an ongoing basis, at least every 5 years, to address natural hazards. • Benefits of mitigation planning include compliance with DMA2000 and ability to apply for project grants, create a path to resiliency, facilitates putting together funding applications, applications will be more competitive. • Once the plan is approved, various projects fall under FEMA’s funding opportunities (listed on slide). • Regular updates of the HMP ensure information in population, development, FEMA mapping, recent hazard and associated impacts, and recent outlier events is up to date and represents the City’s best path forward. 1 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #1 1/20/2021HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Minutes • A 5-year HMP update reflects current conditions and changes. ─ Elle noted 1,200-1,500 additional housing units. ─ Frank said since 2014 they have added about 3,500 units, major area along Revere Beach Blvd, 850 in permitting stage at Suffolk Downs. ─ Anna noted that increases level of risk since more people and property will be in harm’s way in the event of a natural disaster. 3.0 What is included in a plan update? (Anna Foley reviewed information on PowerPoint) • A 5-year window starts the date the plan was adopted, which is why we reference first plan update as 2015 (though the bulk of the City’s first plan update activities occurred in 2014). • This second plan update should be completed by the end of 2021. • The 2015 plan focused on 8 hazards that were prominent in the state plan at the time of first plan update. • Anna stressed how important outreach is for the plan update, to both the general public and other stakeholders. Outreach must be documented throughout the plan update timeline where various avenues are used to reach those groups of people. For example, there should be digital outreach, hard copies posted in public venues, and brought up in regularly scheduled City meetings. ─ Elle Baker noted the City could conduct a survey of some sort through Revere TV and their website. She referenced their current practices for public outreach for open space planning and the RiverFront Master Plan. Need to coordinate the best avenues for outreach. Recently applied for a flood barrier application with 5 other communities. Working with Chelsea and Winthrop on other initiatives, so Revere is okay with contacting other communities to weigh in. ─ Bob O’Brien added that outreach in Revere needs to be multi-lingual as was done for the City’s recent Master Plan so it is broad enough to reach everyone in their diverse community. He referenced recent translations of City documents into Spanish, Portuguese, Cambodian, and Arabic. • Anna recommended discussing the plan update at regularly scheduled meetings open to the public – things like council meetings, planning board meetings, etc. that are already advertised and open to the public. Though unrelated to this project, those meetings offer an opportunity to share brief information about the plan update and where to go for more information, to submit comments, or to become involved. This approach casts a wider net, as it is sometimes difficult to realize high attendee numbers at meetings designed strictly to discuss the HMP; people sometimes do not come out unless it is a post-disaster situation where natural hazards are front and center in everyone’s minds. Additionally, use newsletters, newspapers, community TV, radio, etc. She also noted that reaching out to neighboring communities allows doors of communication to open, since natural hazards do not recognize municipal boundaries. It is good to initiate conversations to invite neighboring communities to learn more and/or become involved. Also, channels of communication can bring to light things that may be occurring in neighboring communities that have impacts (negative or positive) on Revere, and vice versa. It is also good to coordinate if neighboring communities are planning, or presently undergoing, a similar HMP project. • Who are “other stakeholders”? Anna briefly touched on a list of examples. In short, they are not municipal employees, and are not the general public. A full list is on slide #29 of the attached PowerPoint. • Anna noted that it is important to make sure that that City is documenting outreach over the project timeline so it is not a red flag at the end; for example if there is only one outreach platform used, or if all outreach activities are conducted in the last month of the project timeline, that is not a good sign. • Anna handed presentation back over to Aaron who described the plan update fact sheet. • Aaron reviewed the project timeline starting with completed items and then the key future activities and related dates. ─ Aaron noted he has been in touch with the plan reviewer from the State, and he has a good track record with getting plans reviewed in a timely manner. 4.0 General Discussion / Q&A • Bob O’Brien asked if we could identify infrastructure projects now that a new administration has taken over. 2 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #1 1/20/2021HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Minutes ─ Anna responded that projects in the action lists all fall under different funding streams so yes, when you prepare project list, the better idea you have of where you will seek funding from in planning stage it is better for your municipality. It is best to document a variety of funding sources, not strictly FEMA funding streams. ─ Bob responded that they will need a list because they could be provided with funding opportunities sooner rather than later. Riverfront Master plan has many resiliency elements in it that involves POP/Riverside communities, so we should use the master plan to inform our work. The Boston Region Municipal Planning Organization work involves assessing flooding in the Rt 1A transportation corridor that passes through Revere. He thinks we should reference those parallel planning efforts and be familiar with those recommendations and conclusions. Bob wants all planning efforts/projects to be referenced. ─ Bob brought up the Regional Saugus River Floodgate Project that is potentially being reconsidered by the US Army Corps of Engineers. It could be planned in conjunction with the replacement of the Edwards Bridge, which spans the Saugus River. He wants us to raise that issue with MassDOT. Bob also noted insurance implications: Flood insurance costs are a driver in community participation due to flooding shown in FEMA maps that inform insurance rates. The City noted that FEMA’s 2016 flood maps expanded the V-zone, and mapped some V-zones into the landward side of the line of protection, which brought one home’s annual flood insurance premium to $50,000. Bob also mentioned the new fire station that is being constructed in the Point of Pines, which is important for emergency response efforts in this portion of the city. • Elle responded echoing that point, noting that public safety is affected when the fire station is cut off from the Point of Pines and Riverside population. Also, the growth on Revere Beach Boulevard will benefit from this new permanent station. • James Cullen stated that the Fire Department will have a high-water vehicle (not for 2 years), and that the department is looking forward to having a permanent station in the Point of Pines. The high-water vehicle is being funded through an Urban Area Security Committee grant. • Bob suggested that “Shovel Worthy” projects that could be applicable for infrastructure funding such as pump stations and seawall repairs that could be incorporated into this work. • Elle noted her department has been working with Ed Fortuna to create an evacuation center at the senior center, and took a generator from the Beachmont fire station that will allow the senior center to be used as an evacuation space. The City also purchased a number of flood barriers for the senior center. • Bob suggested that the MWRA’s new water line that is proposed to cross the Saugus River into the Point of Pines should be referenced in the plan. • Elle and Frank noted that the City’s outreach to other stakeholders should include MassDOT, DCR, and the MBTA as they own and/or operate a lot of property in Revere. Also noted important developers. 5.0 Discussion Item #1 – Update of Status of Mitigation Measures • Aaron reviewed the action table, which includes 43 actions that were designated by the City in the 2015 plan. The City initiated an update of the status of these actions during a Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee meeting that was held in February 2020. • Regarding mitigation needs at sites not owned by the City, Anna noted the importance of the action description – so while the City may not own the property (and therefore cannot have the action of implementing a particular project) their action could be to meet with the property owner to make them aware of the problem, the impacts of this problem on the City, and any mitigation measures that the City would like to advocate for (that would ultimately be implemented by the owner). The example Anna used was for the problem of flooding on a State-owned roadway running through a municipality, say from an undersized culvert. The municipality does not have the authority to undertake a hazard mitigation project on a State-owned road. However, since the flood conditions affect the City, their action item could be to reach out to the State and possibly schedule a meeting to discuss the problem, its impacts, and possible solutions that the City would like to see (i.e., for the State to increase the size of the culvert running under the roadway so it no longer floods). • Elle noted that for action item 3, seawall upgrade, they are trying to identify what the best resiliency option is as part of the ongoing coastal resilience feasibility study for the Point of Pines and Riverside area. • New items from the Master Plan that need to be added include Gibson Park updated, North Shore Boatyard at 27 Thayer Avenue (acquire property and then make upgrades to mitigate flooding in neighborhood). 3 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #1 1/20/2021HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Minutes • Elle asked if the list should be categorized by if it is infrastructure, plan, upgrade, equipment? This grouping could help with comprehension of funding sources for each project. • Elle added it may be helpful to identify the location of actions on a map to aide in visualization of risk. • Revere Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee members will review list and update accordingly. 6.0 Discussion Item #2 – Update List of Critical Infrastructure • Aaron talked about the need to update this list to accurately reflect what we are considering critical infrastructure. • Elle asked if the list could be tiered to identify higher and lower priority places. • Anna highlighted the nuances between mitigation and emergency response, this is driven by mitigation and not response. • Aaron agreed and said AECOM will address this in current critical infrastructure list before handing it back to Revere to update. 7.0 Discussion Item #3 - Update on Hazard Mitigation Issues • Anna discussed a table that needs to be updated with recent natural hazard event occurrences that have happened since last update was completed. These are organized by natural hazard, and the City can also identify any actions that are ongoing or possible mitigation strategies. • There was a discussion about extreme weather events and mitigation actions over the last 5-6 years: (Aaron transcribed in a separate table) ─ Frank: Tornado in summer 2014. ─ Joe: High tides and nor’easter in March 2018. ─ Bob: Noted that the biggest issue is when a multitude of issues occur at once. ─ Bob: Stated the City has done beach nourishment to help with erosion. ─ Elle: Implemented a program in the Pearl Avenue area to elevate houses. The City has looked at expanding this program, but some upfront costs would need to be incurred by homeowners prior to receiving grant funds. Noted it is an uphill battle with outreach and City Council. Also noted that FEMA buyout for repetitive loss properties is an option to consider. ─ Frank: Major hazards centralize around flooding due to extreme precipitation and high tides combined with storm events. • The City noted it is interested in purchasing properties along Route 1A for marshland restoration purposes (flood mitigation). • Aaron noted NFIP Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) properties in Revere are on the State radar in terms of areas in need of mitigation. 8.0 Final Talking Points, Comments, or Questions • Elle stated t is important to reference the regional flood gate project in the HMP update. She has shared materials with AECOM. • Elle noted it would be helpful to have a way to record data from 311 calls. This would allow for capturing some basic information about location and hazard impacts that could be used to supplement discussions in the plan of not only areas impacted by hazard but frequency of occurrence, typical impacts, etc. 9.0 Action Items • Elle to coordinate the review and update of the mitigation actions included in the 2015 plan. • Elle to coordinate development of a stakeholder list and initiate outreach activities. • AECOM to progress the list of critical facilities/infrastructure and provide to the City for additional revisions. 4 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #1 1/20/2021HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan Update City of Revere, MA Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 2021 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Meeting #1 January 20, 2021 2:00 pm – 4:00 pm 1 Office of Strategic PVliarntunainl Mg &ee Etcinognomic DevelopmentHMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Kickoff Meeting Agenda Welcome and Opening Remarks……………………………………….City of Revere Why is Hazard Mitigation Important?..................................................

Damages and impacts from an event can be staggering and often have long-term consequences. Federal dollars are not always available to aid in the recovery process for every occurrence. 3HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Welcome and Opening Remarks Goal: • More sustainable and disaster resistant communities 4HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Welcome and Opening Remarks Hazard mitigation planning helps to achieve that goal: • Identifying the hazards • Evaluating the risks • Developing a suite of mitigation actions to reduce key risks • Implementing the actions identified in the plan 5HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Why is hazard mitigation important? Most people have been affected by natural hazards in some way. O ur communities are . vulnerable to a variety of hazards ranging from floods, hurricanes, and severe winter weather to storms, extreme winds and heat waves. The magnitude of a disaster depends on the intensity of the event, the number of people and structures exposed, and the effectiveness of pre- disaster mitigation actions in protecting people and property. 6HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Why is hazard mitigation important? Hazard mitigation is the key to resiliency. 7HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Why is hazard mitigation important? HAZARD MITIGATION BREAKS THE CYCLE Less Hazards required to Preparedness Disaster are not prepare for disasters next event After Before Mitigation Mitigation Less Less damage demand on Recovery Response and faster emergency recovery responders 8HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Why is hazard mitigation important? 9HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Why is hazard mitigation important? Implemented hazard mitigation measures will reduce: • the risk of damage to lives and property • the impacts of a hazard event on the economic and social fabric of a community • response time and costs 10HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Why is hazard mitigation important?

A PDF of the presentation is attached to these notes and provides additional details. • Aaron Weieneth provided welcome and opening remarks to the group and proceeded to give an overview of HMP agenda and materials to be covered. Desired outcome is that actions in mitigation strategy will be formed by findings of the risk and vulnerability assessment. 2.0 Updated Risk Assessment (Led by Tom Redstone) • Tom Redstone took over presentation and discussed the intent of the risk assessment in hazard mitigation plans, benefits of updating the risk assessment, and the findings of the risk assessment for this update. • Identified following assessments since 2015 Plan: FEMA defined Special Flood Hazard Area was updated in 2017; Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Summary of Findings Report completed in 2019. • Changes to risk and vulnerability assessment since 2015 Plan: natural hazards are assessed through the context of climate change, in alignment with the 2018 State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP). • While not a traditional natural hazard, invasive species have been added to the 2021 Update to be consistent with SHMCAP. Aside from minor modifications (river flooding now classified as inland flooding), no significant changes were made to the hazards profiled. • Tom reviewed the high-level recurrence intervals that were identified for each hazard, necessary to identify probability of occurrence. Elle noted increasing coastal flooding, precipitation, erosion, high temperatures, and extreme weather. These hazards are already grouped as “high” frequency (recurrence interval of less than 10 years). General consensus was that while there are upticks, observed trends still seem to align with what was in the 2015 Plan. Tom indicated that based on this feedback, he’ll keep as-is, but add text to provide context regarding local observations • Tom summarized the findings of the risk analysis and loss estimation, noting that the findings came from FEMA’s National Risk Index (NRI). Tom acknowledged the following benefits of the NRI data: ─ Expands loss estimations from 2015 Plan to include the following hazards: drought, landslides, hurricanes (beyond wind), severe winter storms, and tornadoes. ─ 2015 Plan just estimated damages from flooding, hurricane winds, and earthquakes. • Tom acknowledged the following shortcomings of the NRI data: ─ Demonstrated by value of hazard exposure (built environment) – should be equal for community-wide hazards (extreme temperatures, hurricanes, severe winter storms, tornadoes, and earthquakes). 1 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #2 4/27/2021HMP Planning Committee Meeting #2 Minutes ─ Census tract data was pulled from a nationwide dataset, and resultantly, required some extrapolation. • Aaron acknowledged limitations of NRI data mentioned that HAZUS would be a good option, but it is not in the scope of this Update. • Elle stated that the City was not prepared to make a decision on whether to include NRI data in the risk assessment at this time. 3.0 Updated Mitigation Goals (Led by Anna Foley) • Anna reviewed goals from the 2015 Plan, informing Committee that mitigation goals are: ─ General guidelines that explain what a community hopes to achieve with a mitigation plan. ─ Broad statements that represent visions for reducing or avoiding future damages and losses. ─ Each action in the mitigation strategy should tie back to one or more goals. • An evaluation or prior goals is required as part of the plan update process. Jurisdictions can either choose to: ─ Keep the previous goals as they were, or ─ Revise them to better reflect current conditions and local priorities. • Anna noted there was a ninth goal in the 2015 plan; however, it was a duplicate and so we removed (Goal #3 and Goal #8 in the prior version both said, “make efficient use of public funds for hazard mitigation”). • During AECOM’s review, the team noticed that the 2015 mitigation strategy did not have any action items falling under the two goals: ─ Education public about zoning/building regulations, particularly with regard to changes in regulations that may affect teardowns and new construction. ─ Encourage future development in areas that are not prone to natural hazards. ─ FEMA reviewers are going to want to see actions to align with goals. Understand that mitigation plans are often robust and that it may not be desirable to add more actions. ▪ One option would be to remove these goals. ▪ Alternatively, the City could opt to keep the goals as is but round out the mitigation strategy to add action items that address Goals 5 and 6. • Regarding #5 – public outreach during the plan maintenance phase (the next 5 years after the update is adopted) is a requirement anyway, so this is just quantifying a topic under an activity that is required • Regarding #6 – The City is presently wrapping up its Capability Assessment, but the in-progress version highlights several areas of improvement, particularly regarding the safe growth audit. • Additionally, the City floodplain manager is probably undertaking some activities on a day-to-day basis that align with both these goals. • Anna asked if there was a general consensus to carry forward the goals from the 2015 Plan? ─ The City concurred. Yes, the 2015 goals will be carried forward. Actions will be added to align with Goals 5 and 6. Anna will craft action item text around the themes presented in her presentation and they will be provided to the City for their review. 4.0 Updated Mitigation Actions (Led by Aaron Weieneth) • Aaron provided a general summary of progress on mitigation actions since the 2015 Plan. ─ A total of 43 actions were included in the 2015 Plan: ▪ 13 actions have been completed. ▪ 9 actions are in progress. ▪ 27 actions were carried forward into the 2021 Update. 2 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #2 4/27/2021HMP Planning Committee Meeting #2 Minutes • 7 new actions have been identified through the City’s MVP planning process and 14 new actions were identified by Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee and feedback from Stakeholder Meeting #1. • Aaron informed Committee that City needs to identify priority level, implementation responsibility, implementation schedule, and the estimated cost. • Aaron asked the City to keep in mind that high priority actions would be more likely to rise to the top in competitive grant programs. • Local review to follow; City to provide comments back to AECOM by the end of the week as far as finalizing priority levels. • General discussion occurred regarding update of mitigation actions: ─ Don mentioned the City is in process of cleaning ditch – all have to be attended to; cleaned ditch off Ocean Ave, process of permitting Green Creek ditch; permitting process of cleaning Traphony Brook – how the City gets to dewater every 12 hours before low tide, has not gotten that opportunity because ditches are so full of sediment. ─ City emphasized the importance of water and drainage projects to the City. City will continue to seek money from local, state, and federal sources to fund these projects. ─ Don mentioned that projects in Riverside, Point of Pines, and Dunn Road are critical for the City. ─ Elle identified preliminary recommendations for Point of Pines. There is a proposed option for a seawall that retracts and is used when necessary. City is also working towards longer-term interventions, such as putting in a flood wall barrier along Mills Riverside Avenue. There is the issue of needing to come back to tie seawall into a high point, and potential logistical challenges with tie in at Route 1A, otherwise flood waters will still enter City. Underground utilities may be a deal breaker. ─ Nick stated that the proposed plan has trench drains at the beginning of each side street, Catch basins do not always function because they are connected to corrugated pipes that were installed in the 1940’s and 1950’s and have been eroded by seawater. First items the City needs is drainage infrastructure and a pump station to remove unwanted water, followed by a seawall. Need pump station to get water back out if wall is breached. Interior drainage is critical element. City looking into a phased approach. ─ Rob mentioned resiliency measures as part of redevelopment plan. Boston and Revere are working on a joint project at Suffolk Downs. Boston is on the same track regarding the Suffolk Downs development. Rob recommended clarifying that drainage project is in the preliminary planning phases. ─ Including projects at preliminary concept level will increase the opportunity of securing regional grants. ─ Elle acknowledged that with so much development going on, some mitigation measures will be paid for by private developers and some will be public. Even if we just add an appendix of mitigation measures paid for by private developers that will be helpful. 5.0 Next Steps (Led by Aaron Weieneth) • Present timeline shows Draft in mid-May. Given that this committee meeting was pushed back a bit the Draft may, in turn, extend out toward late-May. 6.0 General Discussion / Q&A • None. 7.0 Action Items • City to provide comments back to AECOM by the end of the week as far as finalizing priority levels. • City to determine whether NRI data should be included in risk and vulnerability assessment. • City to send follow up info to Aaron; possible addition of an appendix of mitigation measures being implemented at private developments throughout the City. • AECOM to work to craft a couple of mitigation actions to tie back to mitigation goals that currently lack actions. 3 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #2 4/27/2021HMP Planning Committee Meeting #2 City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan Update City of Revere, MA Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 2021 Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Meeting #2 MaArpcrilh 2 37,, 2 2020121 2:30 PM – 4:00 PM 6:00 pm – 7:30 pm Office of Strategic Planning & Economic Development Office of Strategic Planning & Economic Development Virtual Meeting Virtual Meeting 1HMP Planning Committee Meeting #2 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Meeting #2 Agenda Welcome and Opening Remarks City of Revere Updated Risk Assessment AECOM Updated Mitigation Goals AECOM Updated Mitigation Actions AECOM Next Steps AECOM General Discussion/Q & A City of Revere Wrap-up City of Revere Adjourn 2HMP Planning Committee Meeting #2 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Elle Baker, Open Space and Environmental Planner Frank Stringi, City Planner Paul Argenzio, Superintendent DPW Don Ciaramella, Chief of Infrastructure Joe Maglione, Water, Sever and Drain Nick Rystrom, City Engineer Chief Bright, Revere Fire Department Captain Robert Fortuna , Revere Fire Department Chief Callahan, Chief of Police Nick Moulaison, Chair Conservation Commission Dr. Diane Kelly, Superintendent-Revere Public Schools Robert O’Brien Director of Revere Planning and Development Mike Hinojosa, Director of Parks and Recreation Dean Harris, Revere Housing Authority Ralph Decicco, Chair, Commission on Disabilities 3HMP Planning Committee Meeting #2 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee HMP Planning Committee #2 Goals • Confirm Risk/Vulnerability Analysis Results • Review 2015 Goal Statements and Revise if Needed for 2021 Plan • Review Possible Mitigation Actions Ongoing from 2015 • CRB/MVP Planning Actions • Other Priority Actions • 4HMP Planning Committee Meeting #2 Updated Risk Assessment Risk Assessment • Potential for damages created by the interaction of natural hazards and the community. • Provides the factual basis for activities proposed in the strategy to reduce losses from identified hazards. • Local risk assessments must provide information to identify and prioritize mitigation actions to reduce losses from Source: FEMA, 2013 identified hazards.

https://www.revere.org/ 26MVP Workshop # 1 and Workshop #2 City of Revere, Massachusetts • Donald Ciaramella, Project Manager, Department of Engineering • Nick Rystrom, City Engineer, Department of Engineering The Core Project Team, with assistance from Aaron Weieneth (State certified MVP provider), Amanda Shanahan, and Liz Durfee of AECOM, planned and implemented the workshops. AECOM was responsible for preparing workshop materials, leading presentations, facilitating large group discussions, and overseeing the small group discussions. The Core Project Team members and additional City staff were responsible for facilitating and note taking during the small group discussion. Workshop Participants Sixty-nine stakeholders representing departments and decisions-makers from the City of Revere, neighborhoods, business associations, and regional and state entities were invited to the workshops. A total of 38 stakeholders attended Workshop 1 on January 10, 2019 (Figure 1). Twenty-eight stakeholders attended Workshop 2 on January 31, 2019. Both workshops were held at the Point of Pines Yacht Club, located at 28 Rice Avenue in Revere. A complete list of invitees and attendees is included in Appendix A. The stakeholders who attended represented several departments of the City of Revere; Revere neighborhood associations, including individuals from Beachmont, West Revere, and Riverside Association; Point of Pines Yacht Club; Point of Pines Beach Association; Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation; and other entities. Figure 1: Participants of Workshop 1 at the Point of Pines Yacht Club Process Workshop 1 Workshop 1 began with welcome and introductions led by Elle Baker, City of Revere, and a presentation by Aaron Weieneth, AECOM. The presentation included an overview of the MVP program and an introduction to climate change projections and natural hazards. After the presentation, AECOM led a group discussion to identify the top hazards in Revere and recorded these hazards on large flip charts. The remainder of the workshop was dedicated to small group activities and a report out to the larger group. AECOM provided instructions for the breakout group activity. Participants were organized in five groups representing five AECOM 2MVP Workshop # 1 and Workshop #2 City of Revere, Massachusetts geographic areas of the city that had been predetermined by the Core Project Team (Figure 2). These geographic areas included: • Beachmont • Point of Pines / Riverside • Oak Island / Revere Beach • West / North Revere • Sales Creek During Workshop 1, participants identified the need to expand the Sales Creek area to include Youngs Hill. The geographic area approach was used to help facilitate focused discussions on areas of the City that have historically been affected by natural hazards are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The breakout groups were also instructed to consider portions of the City located beyond their assigned area. Figure 2: Five geographic areas identified in Revere for MVP Workshops AECOM 3MVP Workshop # 1 and Workshop #2 City of Revere, Massachusetts Each breakout group consisted of four to ten individuals and a facilitator. Several workshop participants were identified as ‘City-wide’ experts and instructed to participate in the small group discussions in all five geographic areas. The first assignment for each group was to identify the top four hazards the city faces. After discussing and evaluating natural hazards, each group recorded their top four hazards in the “Top Priority Hazards” section of the CRB Risk Matrix, a tool developed as part of the CRB framework. All groups were then tasked with identifying infrastructural, societal, and environmental features that would be impacted by the top four hazards. Participants recorded the ownership and identified the location of each feature on base maps (Figure 3) and in the CRB Risk Matrix (Figure 4). Each feature was categorized as a strength (S) or a vulnerability (V). The breakout group facilitator guided the process of identifying and characterizing features. AECOM staff oversaw the small group discussions and provided assistance as needed. After each group had selected four top priority hazards and populated the Features, Location, Ownership, and V or S columns of the CRB Risk Matrix, AECOM staff led a report out session. A spokesperson from each group reviewed the top four hazards and select infrastructure, society, and environmental features for their geographic area. A summary of these features was captured on a large flip chart. Copies of the base maps used in the workshop are included in Appendix B. Completed CRB Risk Matrices for each geographic area/breakout group are included in Appendix C. Refer to Appendix D for the agenda and meeting materials for Workshop 1. Figure 3: Participants map (left) and discuss (right) features in Workshop 1 Workshop 2 Workshop 2 included a brief presentation by Aaron Weieneth, AECOM, to review: • The City’s objectives for the MVP program • Local natural and climate-related hazards of concern identified in Workshop 1 • Existing and future infrastructural, societal, and environmental strengths and vulnerabilities Following this overview, five geographic area breakout groups were reconvened to develop prioritized actions for the City. With the assistance of a designated facilitator, each group reviewed the CRB Risk Matrix that was initiated in Workshop 1. The next step was to brainstorm actions to reduce vulnerability and reinforce strengths for each of the infrastructural, societal, and environmental features identified in Workshop 1. Participants were given examples of potential actions as well as a list of hazard mitigation measures identified during the preparation of Revere’s Hazard Mitigation Plan in 2014. AECOM 4MVP Workshop # 1 and Workshop #2 City of Revere, Massachusetts Figure 4: Example of a completed CRB Risk Matrix from Sales Creek area participants Several human-caused hazards in Revere were identified during Workshop 1 and documented in the CRB Risk Matrices. While the Core Project Team and other workshop participants recognize that it is important to address these hazards, it was determined that human-caused hazards were out of the scope of this project. The breakout groups were instructed to focus on developing actions for natural and climate-related hazards in Workshop 2. A combined total of 79 actions were developed for Revere. Where appropriate, groups identified which priority hazard(s) each action addressed. The majority of actions addressed flood hazards or multiple hazards. Refer to the CRB Risk Matrices in Appendix D for a complete list of actions. Each breakout group then ranked the priority and identified the timeframe for all proposed actions. Actions were assigned a high (H), medium (M), or low (L) priority based on factors including funding availability, impacts from recent hazards, necessity for advancing longer-term outcomes, contribution towards meeting existing planning objectives, and geographic scope. Participants considered the timeframe to implement actions with respect to factors including need or urgency, feasibility, and cost. Actions were assigned an ongoing (O), short (S), or long (L) timeframe (Figure 4). Each breakout group determined three to five highest priority actions to report out to the large group. The AECOM staff captured these highest priority actions on a flip chart during the report out session, and action commonalities across the breakout groups were identified. For the final step in prioritizing actions, participants were asked to vote on their top five priorities by placing sticky dots next to the actions they considered the highest priorities for the City regardless of the geographic areas (Figure 5). Appendix D includes meeting materials from Workshop 2, and a photograph of Workshop 2 participants is provided as Figure 6.

Community Listening Session Revere hosted a public information and listening session titled “Climate Change & Revere: A Community Listening Session” on April 4, 2019 from 6:30-7:30PM at the Rumney Marsh Academy Auditorium (140 American Legion Highway, Revere, MA). The listening session was advertised on the City’s website, social media, distribution lists, and in the Revere Journal. It was also recorded by RevereTV and posted online. The listening session was kicked off by Mayor Brian Arrigo and provided the public with the opportunity to learn about the MVP workshops and to ask questions and provide feedback about the key findings and top priorities identified during the workshops (Figure 11). Participants also had an opportunity to identify additional issues they are aware of that were not identified in this MVP Summary of Findings Report. Information collected during the listening session is included in Appendix E. Figure 11: Photo of listening session participants 8. Conclusion and Next Steps The priorities identified during the MVP workshops, outlined in this report, and identified during the listening session will be integrated into existing and future municipal planning efforts, including the City’s Master Plan Update, Capital Improvement Plan, and Hazard Mitigation Plan Update. The City will seek funding from the MVP Action Grant Program and other sources to implement the priority actions identified in this report to improve Revere’s resilience to natural hazards and climate change. The City will also submit annual progress reports to the Commonwealth that outline steps taken toward implementing its priority actions to maintain designation as an MVP community. 9.

A PDF of the presentation is attached to these notes and provides additional details. • Aaron Weieneth introduced project and meeting agenda and continued with the presentation 2.0 Update on MVP Program to Date Aaron Weieneth provided the following updates to the group: • A Point of Pines/Riverside Area coastal resilience study was identified as a top priority action from MVP planning grant process. • Past flooding/storm events and re-existing FEMA flood hazard zone mapping were reviewed. • The Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM), developed by Woods Hole Group for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, provides projected coastal flooding for the study area due to sea level rise and coastal storms. The MC-FRM does not take into consideration high precipitation events or inland flooding. • The MC-FRM provides results for Present Day, 2030, 2050, and 2070. • There are two main MC-FRM data products: ─ Annual Coastal Flood Exceedance Probability – shows the likelihood that a location will be flooded ─ Estimated flood depth – provides the anticipated depth of flood water in affected areas • Property ownership in the study area was reviewed and includes a mix of municipal, private, and state-owned properties. • Past studies have been conducted; however, it is time to take a fresh look to identify potential coastal resilience adaptation measures. • The City was awarded a MVP Action Grant to conduct a new feasibility study. 3.0 MVP Action Grant Scope of Work 1 Revere, MA Stakeholder Workshop #1 12/15/2020Stakeholder Workshop 1 - Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study Minutes Aaron Weieneth provided an overview of the following six tasks that comprise the MVP Action grant scope of work: • Task 1: Stakeholder Outreach and Engagement • Task 2: Assessment of Current and Future Conditions • Task 3: Identify Short-Term Resilience Measures • Task 4: Develop Coastal Resilience Toolkit • Task 5: Assess Feasibility of Coastal Resilience Options • Task 6: Point of Pines and Riverside Area Coastal Resilience Feasibility Report 4.0 Project Schedule Aaron Weieneth explained that the coastal resilience feasibility study was kicked off in October 2020, and the project performance period extends through June 2021. He presented a detailed schedule that was included in the presentation. 5.0 Potential Collaboration Opportunities • Aaron Weieneth noted that there are several other projects underway in the study area, including: ─ Boatyard project with potential community rowing/boating access ─ Boston Region MPO Route 1A Corridor Vulnerability Assessment ─ DCR Revere Beach Reservation Vulnerability Assessment ─ RiverFront District Master Plan • Aaron Weieneth presented some detail on stormwater and flooding control measures for the RiverFront District Master Plan. He noted the Point of Pines and Riverside Area Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study will take into consideration recommendations that come out of the master planning effort. 6.0 Stakeholder and Project Partner Feedback and Discussion • Elle Baker indicated that the City of Revere submitted an application to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to revisit a study conducted in the 1990s that recommended a regional flood gate across the Saugus River, along with other proposed flood protection measures. The City expects to receive an update from the USACE in late spring/early summer. (Note: Additional detail on the Regional Saugus River Floodgate Project is available online: https://saugusriverfloodgates.com/.) • Bob O’Brien commented that the primary focus of the study is coastal flooding rather than inland flooding, which includes rain events. He thinks that rain events contribute to flooding that the Riverside Area is currently experiencing and asked how the study would account for inland flooding. ─ Aaron Weieneth stated that MC-FRM mapping does not factor in extreme precipitation events, but we will be looking at precipitation data that is available from ResilientMA and other sources. The City does not have its drainage system modeled in this area, but we have anecdotal information and other resources we can draw from. He noted the need to be careful when building berms and seawalls to account for inland drainage. Otherwise the coastal interventions may result in impoundment areas. ─ Brian Stobbie followed up stating they are dependent on one another; you do not want to retain water and have ponding. • Bob O’Brien noted that although the study is looking at Riverside and Point of Pines together, the study should make distinctions between them given the varying coastal conditions. • Steve Miller commented that there is a substantial difference between storm surge and piped infrastructure. Generally speaking, storm surge overwhelms the precipitation factor. Tide gates are used to prevent inland flooding that would otherwise result from coastal waters during high tides/surges. The Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) did a study of piped infrastructure and how it interfaced with projected coastal conditions. Piped infrastructure can conflict with coastal infrastructure such as tide gates because they do not allow inland flooding to escape. • Elaine Hurley lives on River Avenue and stated that her neighborhood floods regularly during king tides and dependent on which way the wind blows. She stated that she believes the Saugus River flood gate is needed to alleviate the backshore flooding along the Pines River. Elaine worked with the steering committee for the USACE study for four years. ─ Elle Baker reiterated that the City wants to revive the regional flood gate project. 2 Revere, MA Stakeholder Workshop #1 12/15/2020Stakeholder Workshop 1 - Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study Minutes • Bob O’Brien commented on the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) Route 1A vulnerability assessment study, stating that it will be important that whatever results from the Point of Pines/Riverside Area study compliment MPO study. ─ Steve Miller stated that MassDOT engaged the MPO because there is a need for a regional solution for supply chain and general commuting routes that are on the coasts. He is hoping that the MPO study will consider the susceptibility of Route 1A to routine flooding in the future, and what that means to the neighborhoods and cities that Route 1A connects. His focus is on a wider lens than just Revere for how the coast looks in the future. • Bob O’Brien asked if the Saugus River Floodgate project would be among the options considered in the MVP study. ─ Aaron Weieneth stated that although the Floodgate project would be noted in this study, it is a regional project that is outside the scope of the MVP Action grant study. This is not something Revere alone could progress, but it is an important part of a regional solution moving forward. ─ Frank Stringi stated that the Floodgate project is the “save-all” solution for the region. It was authorized in 1992 and was ready for construction, but the Commonwealth’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs stopped it due to concerns about the emphasis on the structural approach. The City is working to get that project back on the front burner and bring it back to life. ─ Bob O’Brien stated that if the Floodgate project becomes part of the recommendation of this study, it can support pushing a regional solution forward and advocating for it on other projects. • Councilor Powers asked how the overtopping by the old boat house in the Riverside area in the near-term could be abated without seawalls? ─ Aaron Weieneth stated that both short-term and long-term solutions will be evaluated as part of the study. A short- term measure could be temporary barriers that are deployable when storms or extreme high tides are forecast. ─ Nick Moulaison stated that Mills Avenue to the Marina needs immediate attention. • Robert O’Brien stated that the existing infrastructure is failing and there is a need to look at what is in place and not functioning. ─ Joe Maglione stated that some storm drain lines/outfalls have been excavated, but sand has since washed back and is now covering them. A special permit is required in order to go onto the beach with equipment. The City sometimes digs out outfalls by hand. A lot of the pipe is corrugated. He commented that there is a lot of study needed in this area. ─ Elle Baker stated that it is important to look at the condition of existing infrastructure as part of the study, and what improvements are needed. • Councilor Powers noted that on Gilbert Avenue, every time there was a storm it used to flood. The City cleaned out the outfall pipes and put flapper valves on some. Councilor Powers asked if flapper valves can be installed on Wadleigh Avenue as well. He believes there is a landing nearby that has an 8- or 10-inch outfall; he also asked if jersey barriers can help. ─ Joe Maglione noted that some of the outfalls in this area have filled in/been clogged with sand. He stated that jersey barriers will not help as part of a temporary solution because the water will flow between/around them; they are not watertight. • Bob O’Brien stated that this study is needed to develop longer lasting solutions that will not be wrecked by the next big storm. • Carolyn Meklenburg expressed enthusiasm and availability to support the MVP project. 7.0 Next Steps • Project Partners meeting scheduled for late January 2021. • Second stakeholder workshop will be conducted in February 2021 to share available findings from Tasks 2, 3, and 4. 3 Revere, MA Stakeholder Workshop #1 12/15/2020Stakeholder Workshop 1 - Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study 1/31/2021 City of Revere Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study for the Point of Pines/Riverside Area – Stakeholder Workshop #1 DPeOcINeTm OFb PeIrN E1S5 /, R 2IV0E2RS0IDE RESILIENCE City of Revere 1 1 Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study for the Point of Pines/Riverside Area –Stakeholder Workshop #1 Elected Officials Project Partners • Mayor Brian Arrigo • Loretta LeCentra–Riverside Area Resident • Ward 5 Councilor, John Powers • Elaine Hurley –Riverside Area Resident Revere City Staff • John Polcari–Point of Pines Beach • Robert O’Brien –Director, Revere Office of Association Planning and Development • Angela Sawaya–Point of Pines Beach • Elle Baker –Project Planner Association • Frank Stringi –City Planner • Stacy Livote–The Marina Restaurant • Don Ciaramella, Superintendent Water, • Carolyn Meklenburg –MVP Regional Sewer and Drain Coordinator • Joe Maglione–Assistant Superintendent • Greg Robbins –DCR Waterways Water, Sewer and Drain • Mary Lester –Saugus River Watershed • Paul Argenzio –Superintendent Revere Council Department of Public Works • Michelle O’Toole –MEMA, Hazard Mitigation • Nick Moulaison–Conservation Commission Planning Project Consultants –AECOM • Brian Lajiness–MBTA, Manager of Emergency Operations • Aaron Weieneth –Project Manager • Steve Miller –MassDOT, Climate Change • Brian Stobbie –Coastal Engineer Project Manager • Ricky Torres-Cooban –Resilience Specialist • Amanda Shanahan –Water Resources Engineer POINT OF PINES / RIVERSIDE RESILIENCE City of Revere 2 2 1Stakeholder Workshop 1 - Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study 1/31/2021 Agenda 1.

He noted the purpose of the memo is to review past reports related to the study area and identify coastal resilience case studies to inform the feasibility study. • Greg Robbins from DCR commented that DCR is initiating a climate change vulnerability assessment of Revere Beach, which scheduled to be complete by June 2021. He noted that Jessica Rowcroft is the DCR point of contact for this project. The results might be too late for the Revere study, but he or Jessica can provide updates. • Loretta LeCentra asked if the past studies have been helpful to inform the current study, and if the past recommendations are applicable today. ─ Aaron Weieneth responded the past studies and reports have provided a lot of helpful background information and data that is being used for the current study. Some elements of the previous recommendations might still be applicable, but they would need to be re-evaluated since site conditions, science, and technologies have changed over time. • 3.0 Review of Draft Point of Pines Beach Management Plan • Aaron Weieneth stated the purpose of the plan is to provide the Point of Pines Beach Association and other stakeholders (such as the City of Revere, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and private landowners) with near-term and lower cost actions that can be implemented as longer-term climate resilience interventions are designed, permitted, and constructed. He reviewed the recommended actions that can be implemented as time and budget allow. • John Polcari stated he is interested in conducting a mapping project for the Point of Pines to document changes in the shoreline over time, potentially using a drone. ─ Elle Baker and Frank Stringi noted that the City has aerial photographs of the city that have been taken every five years that could potentially be reviewed for past conditions. ─ Aaron Weieneth responded that the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management conducted a shoreline change project that illustrates how the shoreline has shifted over time, and that the AECOM team is using this as a data source (https://www.mass.gov/service-details/massachusetts-shoreline-change-project). 1 Revere, MA Partners Meeting #2 01/26/2021Stakeholder Workshop 2 - Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study Minutes RMAT Technical Assistance ─ Bob O’Brien commented that in addition to gradual changes that occur over time, significant impacts to the shoreline can occur due to extreme weather events. • Elle Baker stated she like the recommendation of establishing a record-keeping system. She also liked the recommendation of installing elevated walkways, she but noted this would likely be a higher cost option and could require some permitting. • Steve Miller asked if the City has engaged a coastal engineering firm to evaluate conditions. ─ Elle Baker responded that the POPBA has not worked with such a firm, but coastal engineers were involved with past Army Corps of Engineers studies and design/installation of existing seawalls. ─ Aaron Weieneth clarified that the AECOM team includes coastal engineers who are contributing to the coastal resilience feasibility study, and that they will be involved with presenting study findings and future stakeholder workshops. • Elle Baker noted the Point of Pines Beach Association (POPBA) has already proceeded with installing some sand fences as well as public education signage. She said it would be helpful to update the mapping included in the draft plan to show the existing fencing and have the suggested additional fencing be informed by the placement of the existing fencing. • John Polcari stated that it might be beneficial to extend the sand fencing at the end of the pathways to the beach to help discourage people disturbing the dunes. It would also be helpful to compare the effectiveness of various placements of fencing. • Steve Miller stated that many coastal municipalities have used jetties to help with shoreline erosion issues. ─ Greg Robbins noted that the Point of Pines is a barrier beach, and these types or structures are not allowed for installation. 4.0 Climate Science and Vulnerability Assessment Memo – In Progress • Aaron Weieneth shared initial findings from the climate science and vulnerability assessment memo, noting that more findings will be presented at the next stakeholder workshop. • Steve Miller suggested the source for the Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM) be revised. The current footnote suggests the projections show conditions for year 2020, which was not one of the years of analysis. He also recommended replacing the NOAA sea level rise graphic with the sea level rise values that are used for the MC-FRM. 5.0 Short-Term Resilience Measures Memo – In Progress • Aaron Weieneth provided an overview of the progress to date on the short-term resilience measures memo. 6.0 Project Schedule • Aaron Weieneth stated the team will be wrapping up Task 2 and 3 over the next few weeks and will progress Task 4 Develop Coastal Resilience Toolkit. Will also be preparing for Stakeholder Workshop #2. 7.0 Next Steps • Second stakeholder workshop will be held February 23, 2021 from 6-7PM. The workshop will cover: ─ Findings from Task 2: Assess Current and Future Conditions ─ Findings from Task 3: Identify Short-Term Resilience Measures ─ Findings from Task 4: Develop Coastal Resilience Toolkit ─ Seek input on criteria used to assess feasibility of coastal resilience options • Schedule final partners meeting ─ Week of April 5, 2021 (tentative) • Elle Baker requested that the Partners provide her with their comments on the Draft Past Studies, Case Studies, and Historical Data Memo and Draft Beach Management Plan by February 5, 2021. 2 Revere, MA Partners Meeting #2 01/26/2021Stakeholder Workshop 2 - Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study 1/31/2021 City of Revere Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study for the Point of Pines/Riverside Area – Partners Meeting #2 JPaOnINuTa OryF P2IN6E, S2 /0 R2IV1ERSIDE RESILIENCE City of Revere 1 1 Agenda 1.

The meeting was recorded and also broadcast live on RevereTV and streamed on the City’s YouTube channel. • Elle Baker made introductions and opening remarks regarding the importance of the project, before turning things over to Aaron Weieneth. A PDF of the presentation is attached to these notes and provides additional details. • Aaron Weieneth introduced the team and gave attendees an overview of the meeting agenda. He then discussed how the hazard mitigation planning process, and the implementation of the hazard mitigation plan (HMP), can help Revere achieve its goal of becoming more sustainable and resilient. • Aaron started off the presentation talking about natural hazards; they are a part of Revere’s past and future. Damages can have long term consequences and federal funding isn’t always available after a disaster. • The overall objective of a HMP is to make the City more sustainable and resilient in the short/long term. • Hazard mitigation helps achieve that goal by identifying hazards, evaluating risks, developing mitigation actions, and then successfully implementing those actions. • Aaron turned things over to Anna Foley. 2.0 Why is Hazard Mitigation Important? (Anna Foley presented) • Anna noted that most people have been affected by a natural hazard. • The magnitude depends on the intensity of the event, the number of people and structures exposed, and the effectiveness of pre-disaster mitigation actions in protecting people and property. • Hazard mitigation is the key to resiliency. By mitigating at-risk elements of the built environment today, and incorporating mitigation and resiliency concepts into areas of future development, we can reduce the impacts of future natural disaster events. • Typically, when a hazard event occurs, communities go through a cycle of disaster response, recovery, mitigation, and planning for next event. Hazard mitigation breaks the cycle. As communities implement mitigation measures, the hazards they are impacted by create fewer emergency situations for local responders to attend to, and cause less damage in need of costly repairs. The community’s recovery is facilitated by reduced impacts to the economic and 1 Revere, MA Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 03/03/2021Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 Minutes social fabric of the community, and there is generally less to be done to get the community back to the point where they are sufficiently prepared for future events. • Mitigation works. It reduces exposure, saves money, and protects lives and property. An updated study by the Multi- Hazard Mitigation Council (part of that National of Institute Building Sciences) estimated that federally funded hazard mitigation projects had an overall benefit cost ratio of 6 to 1. Meaning that on average, $6 would be saved for every $1 spent on mitigation projects. This is not true for every project, but it does speak to the overall value of investing in hazard mitigation projects – done properly, they will save far more money than their project cost. • Natural disasters can’t be prevented, but their impacts can be reduced. For example, raising utilities, elevating structures, building protective dunes. 3.0 Mitigation Planning and Plan Updates (Anna Foley presented) • Prior to the passage of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) local communities were considered eligible applicants for federal hazard mitigation project funding streams as long as their State had a hazard mitigation plan in place. With the passage of DMA 2000, the State plan requirement was continued, and a new requirement was added for local communities to also have a hazard mitigation plan in place for eligibility to apply for mitigation project grants. • Local plans can benefit from updated hazard assessments in their State plans. Revere’s plan update will be informed by the 2018 Massachusetts Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan by, among other things, incorporating climate change impacts for various hazards. • Plans must be updated every five years (with reapproval by FEMA, and readoption by the community). • Anna explained how stakeholder input is critical for the success of the HMP. • The HMP requires ongoing commitment at a local level to implement the projects identified in the plan. This involves striking a balance between competing constraints such as staff capabilities, their time, and funding availability. • Benefits of mitigation planning: ─ Eligibility to apply for hazard mitigation project grants ─ Path to resiliency • By updating the plan, the City will maintain its eligibility to apply for grant funding for projects such as road raising, culvert upgrades, minor localized flood reduction projects, generators, bridge retrofits, utility protection. • Regular updates make sure the plan represents present-day conditions in the community and a current understanding of vulnerabilities based on the most current mapping, data, and technical information. Updates also ensure that the plan implementation strategy still accurately represents what the City would like to see and do moving forward. • Initial Revere HMP was adopted in 2005. The first update was in 2015. The second plan update process began in 2020 and will be completed this year, 2021. 4.0 Overview of Current Plan (Anna Foley presented) • The State Plan included four hazards that were deemed to not pose a significant threat and therefore were not included in the plan. Eight hazards were identified as significant hazards and were included. • AECOM then opened the floor for comments from attendees regarding notable hazard occurrences in Revere since 2015. (Open discussion) ─ Bob O’Brien noted flooding on the Pines River area during high tides and storm events. Beach erosion and scouring. Major transportation routes such as Route 1A, Route 107, and the MBTA Blue Line have been flooded, which has isolated parts of the City. ─ Frank Stringi brought up the tornado of 2015 that damaged the center of the City, down Broadway on the Chelsea line, caused damage to store fronts, trees, utilities, etc. People were left homeless, some homes were demolished, and overall the City wasn’t prepared. (Another attendee noted this occurred on July 28, 2014.) No loss of life was recorded for this incident. ─ Another vulnerability the City has is high marsh grass and phragmites. These have and can be sources of brush fires that are close to houses and can become challenging to control in high wind scenarios. The rail lines through the marsh sometimes create sparks which ignite adjacent vegetation. 2 Revere, MA Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 03/03/2021Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 Minutes ─ Heavy winds cause problems with trees and powerlines, which exacerbate utility companies and emergency response staff. ─ One attendee observed that interior flooding seems to occur in Revere on a monthly basis now; more often than when the plan was last updated. ─ Elle Baker mentioned the Route 1A study conducted by the Boston Region MPO touches upon things such as the phragmites and Route 1A flood mitigation. She also reported that Mills Avenue floods often now at king tides and sometimes even at high tide. ─ Elle noted that the Beachmont area is a high priority as well, but it needs a higher rate of funding than MVP can offer. The HMP update will allow them to apply for more funding through FEMA grant programs. ─ Frank noted the City has ongoing and future stormwater improvement projects to mitigate flooding such as the Eastern County Ditch drainage improvement project; as well as other projects that have been implemented since the plan was last updated. ─ Frank also brought up construction in the flood plain, specifically Suffolk Downs – everything built will be planned with updated resiliency standards. ─ Bob O’Brien touched on the new FEMA flood maps (2016) and what a useful tool this is moving forward for instituting resiliency during the construction phase for new developments. ─ Elle brought up the progressive initiatives that have been in progress. One such initiative is the Saugus River Flood Gate Project. This project has been in the works for decades and involved collaboration between five cities/towns that will protect coastal properties. Objectives of this project include natural flood protection solutions. The towns/cities submitted an application for a feasibility study to Army Corp of Engineers, and also an application for a Regional Watershed Working Group. Progress is being made on many different fronts. ─ Bob O’Brien brought up rising insurance rates in coastal areas. Noted this is a cost of not paying attention to resiliency. Bob recognized a much higher level of community awareness regarding hazard mitigation and resiliency, even in the few years since the plan was last updated. ─ Aaron asked Chief Bright if there are records of past events such as brush fires. Is that something we can follow up on to retrieve documentation of? Chief Bright responded yes. ─ Bob and Elle expressed a desire for wildfires to be moved into a significant hazard. 5.0 Participation Requirements (Anna Foley presented) • Members of the HMP planning team include those who participated in the last update, community leaders, government agency representatives, elected officials, interested citizens, etc. • Anna explained how a wide range of organizational input ensures the mitigation plan is as comprehensive as possible. • Stakeholder engagement is important in providing feedback not only on past events, but also for their thoughts on potential future issues (the so-called “accidents waiting to happen”). Current residents possess the most comprehensive understanding of the City’s vulnerabilities to natural hazards and can provide feedback that can supplement data and information that is maintained online by state and federal agencies. 6.0 Status of the 2021 Plan Update (Aaron Weieneth presented) • So far, the following tasks have been completed or initiated: ─ Updated land use based on MassGIS. ─ Updated mitigation actions included in the 2015 HMP. ─ Initiated update of critical facilities and infrastructure lists. ─ Initiated vulnerability assessment to compare critical facilities against updated hazards. • Aaron presented the timeline of key future activities. Next item on the timeline is the Local HMP Committee Meeting #2 in early April. The HMP update is scheduled to wrap up by the end of June 2021. 3 Revere, MA Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 03/03/2021Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 Minutes 7.0 Feedback on Strategy and Action Development & Preliminary Actions for 2021 HMP • Aaron reviewed a summary of the 43 mitigation actions included in the 2015 HMP and MVP Community Resilience Building Risk Matrix Summary Table. • Aaron then reviewed some of the new actions that will be included in the 2021 HMP, such as an upgrade of the Point of Pines pump station and pump, increasing the City’s tree canopy, beach nourishment and erosion control, and Ambrose Park drainage improvements. • Bob O’Brien noted he would like to see the mitigation actions listed according to their state of readiness. 8.0 Group Discussion – Suggestions for additional actions? • Elle noted that the new Point of Pines Fire Station is a huge benefit to residents along Revere Beach Boulevard with the additional future 3,500 units. • Bob noted the City is building a new DPW facility and need to think about how new capabilities can be incorporated. • Paul Argenzio said they are trying to make the DPW facility be net zero with its own power source. It will be protected from flooding even though the facility is along the marsh. • Bob suggested that Suffolk Downs, the new DPW facility, and the new Point of Pines Fire Station stand as a testament to the City’s ongoing commitment and dedication to hazard mitigation and resiliency. 4 Revere, MA Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 03/03/2021Stakeholder List Hazard Mitigation Stakeholders Entity Contact Name State Agencies DCR MassDot Steve Miller MBTA Hannah Lyons-Galante MWRA ACOE Kennelly, John R CIV USARMY CENAE (USA MPO Seth Asante City of Revere Mayor Brian Arrigo Revere Office of Planning and Development Elle Baker, Project Planner Director of Planning and Community Development Tech Leng Revere Office of Planning and Development Frank Stringi, Chief City Planner Revere Office of Planning and Development Julie Demauro, Transportation Coordinator Revere Office of Engineering Nick Rystrom, Don Ciaramella Revere Police Department Chief Callahan Revere Fire Department Chief Bright Emergency Management -RFD Captain Fortuna Superintendent, Revere DPW Paul Argenzio Revere Housing Authority Revere Commission on Disabilities Ralph Dicicco Revere Conservation Department TBD 311 Department Reuben Cantor City Clerk to Revere City Council Ashley Melnik Service Providers NGRID Dan Cameron RCN COMCAST Developers HYM O'Brien Redgate Damian Szary Gansett Ventures Post Road Hospitals East Boston Neighborhod Health Cambridge Health Alliance Mass General Hospital Neighborhood Associations Revere Community Council ( Shirley Ave Area)Stakeholder List Beachmont Improvement Committee Kathleen Heiser North Revere Neighborhood Group Vanessa Biasella Oak Island Neighborhood Group Margo Johnson Point of Pines Beach Association Jack Polcari -

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Executive Summary Hazard mitigation is defined as any sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk to life and property from natural hazard events. Hazard mitigation breaks the repetitive cycle of disaster damage, recovery, and repeated disaster damage. Hazard mitigation planning reduces the loss of life and property by minimizing the impacts of disasters. It is a proactive effort to identify actions that communities can take to reduce the dangers to life and property from natural hazard events. Mitigation plans are critical to breaking the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction by developing long-term strategies to protect life, property, and the environment from natural disasters. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) requires all municipalities to adopt a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-approved local multi-hazard mitigation plan to be eligible for Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) funding. Pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) – 44 § 201.6 (d) (3), a local jurisdiction must review and revise its plan to reflect changes in development, progress in local mitigation efforts, and changes in priorities and resubmit every five years in order to continue to be eligible for mitigation project grant funding. The City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan – 2022 Update (hereafter, 2022 Update) was completed in accordance with 44 CFR § 201.6 (d) (3). Planning Process Planning for the 2022 Update was led by the Revere Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee (hereafter, Planning Committee), composed of staff from several different City Departments. The Planning Committee discussed where the impacts of natural hazards most affect the City, goals for addressing these impacts, and hazard mitigation measures that would benefit the City. The following two Local Hazard Planning Committee Meetings were held to support the 2022 Update: • Local Hazard Planning Committee Meeting #1, January 20, 2021. • Local Hazard Planning Committee Meeting #2, April 27, 2021. The following two Public Stakeholder Meetings were held to support the 2022 Update: • Public Stakeholder Meeting #1, March 3, 2021. • Public Stakeholder Meeting #2, October 7, 2021. Risk Assessment The Risk Assessment includes a description of the type, location, and extent of all-natural hazards that can affect Revere. New to the 2022 Update is the organization of natural hazards through the following climate change interactions: changes in precipitation, sea level rise, rising temperatures, and extreme weather, in addition to non-climate influenced hazards. The 2022 Update provides risk assessment for the following natural hazards in Revere, outlined by climate change interaction: Changes in Precipitation • Inland Flooding • Drought • Landslides AECOM ES-1",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Sea Level Rise • Coastal Flooding • Coastal Erosion • Tsunamis Rising Temperatures • Hurricanes/Tropical Storms • Severe Winter Storms • Tornadoes In addition, the Risk Assessment profiles earthquakes, which are considered a non-climate influenced hazard. Hazard Mitigation Strategy The Hazard Mitigation Strategy provides the City’s blueprint for reducing the potential losses identified in the risk assessment, based on existing authorities, policies, programs, and resources, and its ability to expand on and improve existing tools. Hazard Mitigation Goals and Actions, listed below, form the basis of the mitigation strategy. Hazard Mitigation Goals 1) Ensure that critical infrastructure sites are protected from natural hazards. 2) Protect existing residential and business areas from flooding. 3) Make efficient use of public funds for hazard mitigation. 4) Continue to enforce existing zoning and building regulations. 5) Educate the public about zoning and building regulations, particularly about changes in regulations that may affect tear downs and new construction. 6) Encourage future development in areas that are not prone to natural hazards. 7) Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures. 8) Protect the City’s ability to respond to various natural hazard events. Plan Adoption and Maintenance The process for reviewing and updating Revere’s Hazard Mitigation Plan is summarized in Table ES-1. AECOM ES-2",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Table ES-1: Plan Review and Update Chapter Reviews and Updates 2 Planning An active stakeholder engagement and public involvement process is critical to developing or Process updating a hazard mitigation plan. The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee was established to lead the planning process for the 2022 Update. The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee encompasses an interdisciplinary group of stakeholders from the City, and includes representation from first responders and emergency managers, planning and development, engineers and infrastructure operators, and the City’s school department. 3 Risk The Planning Committee gathered the most recently available hazard and land use data and met Assessment with City staff to identify changes in local hazard areas and development trends. City staff reviewed critical infrastructure to create an up-to-date list. 4 Hazard The Hazard Mitigation Strategy, comprised of goals and actions, were reviewed during the Mitigation planning process, and endorsed by the Planning Committee. Mitigation measures from the 2015 Strategy Update were reviewed and assessed as to whether they were completed, on-going, or deferred. The Planning Committee determined whether to carry forward measures into the 2015 Update or delete them. The Hazard Mitigation Strategy for the 2022 Update reflects both new measures and measures carried forward from the 2015 Update. The Planning Committee re-prioritized all these measures based on current conditions 5 Plan Adoption This section of the plan was updated with a new on-going plan and implementation review and five-year update process that will assist the City in incorporating Maintenance hazard mitigation issues into other City planning and regulatory review processes and better prepare the City to update the plan in 2021. Moving forward into the next five-year plan implementation period there will be many more opportunities to incorporate hazard mitigation measures into the City’s decision-making processes. The City will document any actions taken within this iteration of the Natural Hazard Mitigation on challenges met and actions successfully adopted as part of the ongoing work of the biannual survey and four-year update to be conducted by the Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team, as described in Chapter 6 Plan Adoption and Maintenance. The Hazard Implementation Team did not meet regularly, conduct a bi-annual survey or four-year update as described in Chapter 6 perhaps due to the absence of any one City department having been designated to follow up and implement the plan and coordinate plan review and updating. This plan update includes a revised plan implementation process in Chapter 6 that addresses these issues from the previous update. AECOM ES-3",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 1. Introduction 1.1 Planning Requirements under the Federal Disaster Mitigation Act The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) requires that after November 1, 2004, all municipalities that wish to continue to be eligible to for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) funding to adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan, which must be updated in five-year intervals. This planning requirement does not affect post-disaster Public Assistance (PA) funding. Revere completed its Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) in 2005, and previously updated it in 2015. 1.1.1 Previous Federal and State Disasters The City of Revere has experienced 23 natural hazards that triggered federal or state disaster declarations since 1991.

Was the plan revised to reflect changes in priorities? (Requirement §201.6(d)(3)) A significant revision to the City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan (2022 Update) includes the reorganization of natural hazards through the context of climate change to reflect the increasing urgency of climate change. This is consistent with the approach taken in the Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan – 2018 (2018 SHMCAP). Furthermore, FEMA’s National Risk Index (NRI) was leveraged to update the risk analysis and loss estimation. While there are some limitations with regards to analyzing NRI data at the local scale, it serves as a useful starting point to estimate damages from the following natural hazards for which loss estimates were not provided in the 2015 Update of the City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan (2015 Update): drought, landslides, hurricanes (beyond wind), severe winter storms, and tornadoes. The 2022 Update also reflects changes in flood risk from the 2017 update to the FEMA-delineated Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). Lastly, the mitigation goals and actions identified in the Hazard Mitigation Strategy were revised in accordance with the needs of the community. The City’s Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) planning process identified seven new mitigation actions to include in the 2022 Update, and 14 new actions were identified by the Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee and feedback from Stakeholder Meeting #1.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 2. Planning Process An active stakeholder engagement and public involvement process is critical to developing or updating a hazard mitigation plan. This section describes the planning process taken with the Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee, which was established to lead the 2022 Update. Furthermore, the City recognizes that resilience planning is not limited to the hazard mitigation planning process. Resultantly, this section summarizes planning activities the City has taken to improve resilience that have occurred in addition to the efforts taken in accordance with CFR requirements. A review of how existing studies were incorporated into the 2022 Update is followed by a summary of public outreach activities taken to support the 2022 Update. 2.1.1 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee and Stakeholders A1. Does the Plan document the planning process, including how it was prepared and who was involved in the process for each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6 (C) (1)) The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee was led by Elle Baker, Open Space and Environmental Planner within the Revere Office of Planning and Development. Because the Office of Planning and Development has regulatory authority in the City, it was deemed appropriate to lead the 2022 Update. The Planning Committee was established to lead the planning process for the 2022 Update. Because the 2022 Update is for a single jurisdiction, every member of the Planning Committee represents the City of Revere. Some members of the Planning Committee are displayed in Table 2-1. A full stakeholder list representing the Planning Committee can be found in Appendix A.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update As shown in Table 2-1 and Appendix A, the Planning Committee encompasses an interdisciplinary group of stakeholders from the City, and includes representation from first responders and emergency managers, planning and development, engineers and infrastructure operators, and the City’s school department. In addition, the Planning Committee includes stakeholder who represent community members with access and functional needs. 2.1.2 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Meeting #1 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Meeting #1 was held on January 20, 2021. The Planning Committee was provided an overview on the importance of updating hazard mitigation plans, benefits of updating hazard mitigation plans, and requirements of plan updates. Meeting #1 resulted in the identification of 14 new mitigation actions to be incorporated into the Hazard Mitigation Strategy. In addition, the Planning Committee discussed the following: • Opportunities to engage the public and other stakeholders. • Need for stakeholder engagement to be multi-lingual and accessible to English language learners. • Recent changes in development. • Updating priority projects for the mitigation strategy. Meeting minutes from Planning Committee Meeting #1 can be found in Appendix A. 2.1.3 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee Meeting #2 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee #2 was held on April 27, 2021. The Planning Committee was provided an overview of and an opportunity to comment on the findings of the Risk Assessment. Furthermore, the Planning Committee reviewed 2015 Goal Statements, providing comments as necessary, and reviewed possible mitigation actions. In addition, the Planning Committee discussed and highlighted the following: • With so much private development going on in the City, some mitigation measures will be funded by developers while others will be funded by the City. • The City is collaborating on a joint project at Suffolk Downs. • Importance of identifying or clarifying the method of prioritizing mitigation actions. • Whether to incorporate data sourced from FEMA’s National Risk Index into the findings of the Rusk Assessment. Meeting minutes from Planning Committee Meeting #2 can be found in Appendix A. 2.2 Planning Activities Beyond the 2022 Update Hazard mitigation planning should not occur independent of other community planning activities. The City has held stakeholder workshops to support the Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Program and workshops specific to the Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study for the Point of Pines Riverside Area. Stakeholder engagement activities taken to support these efforts are summarized in the following sections. 2.2.1 Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Program The Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Program is designed to increase resiliency to natural hazards that are exacerbated by climate change at the municipal level. The planning process included 69 stakeholders representing municipal departments and decision-makers from the City of Revere, neighborhoods, business associations, and regional and state entities were invited to the workshops. A summary of each public information and listening session is included below. AECOM 5",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 2.2.1.1 Workshop 1 A total of 38 stakeholders attended Workshop 1 on January 10, 2019. Workshop 1 included an overview of the MVP Program and an introduction to climate change projections and natural hazards. A group discussion was held to identify the top hazards in Revere before participants separated into breakout groups representing five distinct geographic areas of the City. An expanded summary of Workshop 1 can be found in Appendix A. 2.2.1.2 Workshop 2 A total of 28 stakeholders attended Workshop 2 on January 31, 2019. Workshop 2 discussed the City’s objectives for the MVP Program, local natural and climate-related hazards of concern, and existing and future infrastructural, societal, and environmental strengths and weaknesses. Mitigation measures identified in the 2015 Update were also reviewed during Workshop 2, demonstrating the City’s interdisciplinary and holistic approach to mitigation and resilience planning. Participants brainstormed actions to reduce vulnerability and reinforce strengths for each of the City’s strengths and vulnerabilities. An expanded summary of Workshop 2 can be found in Appendix A. 2.2.1.3 Climate Change & Revere: A Community Listening Session Lastly, the City hosted the climate change listening session on April 4, 2019, attended by a total of 27 participants. The listening session offered participants the opportunity to ask questions and provide written comments. A summary of the listening section can be found in Appendix A. 2.2.2 Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study for the Point of Pines/Riverside Area The Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study for the Point of Pines/Riverside Area was identified as a top priority action from the MVP planning process, as the neighborhood is vulnerable to flooding and coastal erosion. The City has hosted two stakeholder workshops as of the time of the 2022 Update to support the feasibility study, which are summarized in the paragraphs below. 2.2.2.1 Stakeholder Workshop #1 A total of 18 attendees were present for the first workshop, held on December 15, 2020 in which current and future conditions were discussed. Stakeholders discussed existing concerns in addition to opportunities to collaborate with partners. A summary of the workshop can be found in Appendix A. 2.2.2.2 Stakeholder Workshop #2 A total of nine attendees were present for the second workshop, held on January 26, 2021. The purpose of the workshop was to provide an update on the feasibility study and discuss the assessment of current and future conditions in addition to the identification of potential short-term resilience measures. A summary of the workshop can be found in Appendix A. 2.3 Review and Incorporation of Existing Studies A4. Does the Plan review and incorporate existing plans, studies, reports, and technical information? (Requirement §201.6(b)(3)) Planning is an iterative and interdisciplinary process. Hazard mitigation plans should not be updated in isolation without consideration of stakeholder feedback sought for existing planning activities or the findings of such plans. As such, a variety of plans, studies, and reports were leveraged and incorporated into this Update. These sources are cited throughout this Update. Notable sources used throughout this Update are outlined below. 2.3.1 City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan – 2015 Update Because this is an update to Revere’s existing plan, the 2015 Update was leveraged as the bases for the 2022 Update. Details regarding major changes are included in Section 1.2 Changes since 2015 Update. AECOM 6",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 2.3.2 Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan – 2018 (2018 SHMCAP) As with previous Updates, the 2018 SHMCAP was leveraged as a starting point to identify potential hazards and the risk they present to the Commonwealth. A significant change in the 2018 SHMCAP compared to prior versions is the framing of potential hazards through lens of climate change interactions, which include changes in precipitation, sea level rise, rising temperatures, and extreme weather. The effects of climate change on each hazard, as identified in the 2018 SHMCAP, were incorporated into the Risk Assessment. 2.3.3 City of Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Summary of Findings Report – 2019 (Revere MVP Report, 2019) The 2019 Revere MVP Report identifies existing and future vulnerabilities and strengths and identifies opportunities to take action to reduce risk and build resilience, as well as implement key actions identified through the planning process. Specifically, seven new mitigation actions identified in the Hazard Mitigation Strategy were identified through the City’s MVP planning process. The MVP Report, 2019 is referenced throughout this Update. 2.3.4 Next Stop Revere – 2020 Next Stop Revere is the City’s Master Plan, the City’s first comprehensive master plan developed in more than four decades. Among other objectives, the plan aims to promote resiliency of the City in the face of increasing climate challenges through comprehensive climate mitigation and resiliency strategies and energy efficiency programs and to position City government at the forefront of regional collaboration, climate resiliency, and mitigation programs. In addition, Next Stop Revere was used to identify current and anticipated changes in development and to update Section 3.1 Community Profile. 2.3.5 National Risk Index The National Risk Index was used to update the Risk Analysis and Loss Estimation. While several limitations were identified with regards to applying the findings to a municipal scale, it provided a useful high-level summary of the community’s risk and vulnerability. 2.4 Public Outreach A3. Does the Plan document how the public was involved in the planning process during the drafting stage? (Requirement §201.6(b)(1)) The City of Revere has performed stakeholder engagement and sought public input on several planning initiatives to improve the City’s resilience to natural hazards during the current planning cycle. The City hosted two public stakeholder meetings that empower the community to participate in the 2022 Update. In addition to the Planning Committee, stakeholders representing state agencies, service and emergency service providers, developers, hospitals, neighborhood associations, and environmental organizations were targeted and engaged in the planning process.

The importance of hazard mitigation, hazard mitigation planning, and plan updates was discussed. The status of the 2022 Update and existing mitigation actions included in the Hazard Mitigation Strategy were discussed. Items discussed at Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 included the new Point of Pines Fire Station, the new Department of Public Works facility, and ongoing resiliency work at Suffolk Downs. A summary of Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 can be found in Appendix A. 2.4.2 Public Stakeholder Meeting #2 The second public stakeholder meeting was held on October 7, 2021. The meeting included a review on the importance of hazard mitigation, an overview of hazard mitigation planning and plan updates, and a summary of the findings of the 2022 Update, and an opportunity for comment and discussion. The meeting also provided the community the opportunity to review and comment on the 2022 Update, which wis posted on the City’s website, and community members were provided the opportunity to comment on the plan between October 1 and October 15. It was noted that the 2022 Update is a lengthy document for the general public to read, and as such, the Strategy section was excerpted for more accessible public viewing. A summary of Public Stakeholder Meeting #2 can be found in Appendix A. 2.5 Opportunity for Neighboring Communities and Regional Agencies A2. Does the Plan document an opportunity for neighboring communities, local and regional agencies involved in hazard mitigation activities, agencies that have the authority to regulate development as well as other interests to be involved in the planning process? (Requirement §201.6(b)(2)) The City provided the following communities the opportunity to participate in the planning process: • Chelsea • Winthrop • Saugus • Malden • Lynn • Everett These neighboring communities were invited to review and provide comments on the draft update, which was posted on the City’s website for public viewing. As previously stated, the City recognizes hazard mitigation planning should not occur independent of other community and resilience planning activities. The City is engaged with the neighboring communities of Chelsea and Winthrop through the North Suffolk Office of Resiliency and Sustainability (NSORS). The City has also been coordinating with the neighboring communities to progress regional flood mitigation efforts. Funding has been secured for a regional flood mitigation working group that will be advanced this fiscal year. In addition, the City has been coordinating regularly with the City of Boston to improve coastal flood resilience at Suffolk Downs, which encompasses portions of both cities. The cities are collaborating to identify opportunities for flood protection alignments based on existing physical conditions, the location of flood pathways, and the extent of flooding. AECOM 9",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 3. Risk Assessment The City’s climate, geography, and demography significantly determine its risk and vulnerability to impacts from natural hazards. Because risk is at the nexus of natural hazards and human infrastructure, this Risk Assessment begins with a review of Revere’s community profile. The community profile includes a review of the City’s social and economic profile, followed by the land use profile and a review of development trends. Finally, the community profile includes a review of the City’s climate, which affect many hazards the City may be vulnerable to and summarizes how the City’s climate has changed in recent decades. The Risk Assessment continues with a description of future climate projections in the city followed by a review all potential natural hazard events that may occur in the City, leveraging work completed as part of the 2018 2018 SHMCAP and the 2019 Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (Revere MVP, 2019) Summary of Findings Report to identify potential hazards. In compliance with the requirements outlined in 44 CFR § 201.6 (c) (2), the Risk Assessment provides the factual basis for activities proposed in the mitigation strategy to reduce losses from identified natural hazards, which are defined as environmental phenomena that have the potential to impact societies and the human environment.2 The Risk Assessment consists of the following components: • A description of the type, location, and extent of all-natural hazards that can affect the City, including previous occurrences and probability of future events, pursuant to 44 CFR § 201.6 (c) (2) (i). • A description of the City’s vulnerability to the hazards pursuant to 44 CFR § 201.6 (c) (2) (ii). The Risk Assessment is organized into the following sections: 3.1 Community Profile 3.2 Future Climate Change Projections in Revere 3.3 Natural Hazard Identification and Profile of Natural Hazards 3.4 Community Assets 3.5 Risk Analysis and Loss Estimation 3.6 Vulnerability Summary 3.1 Community Profile The Community Profile includes a summary of the City’s social and economic profile, land use profile and development trends, as well as an overview of the City’s climate profile, including current and future conditions. 3.1.1 Social and Economic Profile Revere is a developed city in Suffolk County, located between the North Shore and Boston. Data on social and economic conditions was compiled for comparative purposes and social and economic conditions are presented for Revere and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts using 2015-2019 American Community Survey 5-year estimates, the most recent data available. To assess how the social and economic conditions of the City have changed in recent years, 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-year estimates are also provided. The population of Revere has grown by approximately 7 percent since 2010, and currently has an approximate population of 53,700.

(Requirement §201.6(d)(3)) The City of Revere is largely developed, with limited developable land available. Resultantly, new development is largely limited to infill. As new development and redevelopment occurs, it will be subject to the latest building code requirements and zoning regulations. According to the Mass Builds database, 34 development projects were completed in Revere between 2015 and 2020 and another 21 are scheduled for completion in future years. Development projects are dispersed around the City and are not expected to significantly change the City’s vulnerability to natural hazards. While a sizable portion of the City is vulnerable to flooding and coastal hazards, the community’s participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) mitigates the community’s vulnerability to such hazards. Aside from tax exempt land (which includes public right of ways, easements, and municipal property), single-family and multi-family residential properties account for most of the City’s developable land.

Lastly, the Hazard Mitigation Strategy outlined in Section 4 reflects findings from Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee #1, in which the Planning Committee discussed recent changes in development, as noted in Section 0. Because Revere is largely developed, changes in development are primarily limited to infill development. At the Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee #1, it was noted there are approximately 3,500 more housing units in Revere than there were in 2014. 3.1.3 Climate Profile and Climate Change Prior to reviewing the climate profile of Revere, it is important to highlight the difference between climate, weather, and climate change. Climate: describes the typical weather conditions over a long period of time in a specific area. Typical indices of climate include temperature, precipitation, humidity, sun, and wind speed and direction. Climate refers to average indices, such as temperature and precipitation, over a long period of time. NOAA uses a time-period of 30 years to determine climate normal. AECOM 16",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Weather: refers to short-term changes in the atmosphere in the short-term. Natural hazards are frequently a result of hazardous weather events. Climate change: The climate at any location is not typically a steady state. Observations of factors such as temperature and precipitation, for example, regularly differ from long-term averages, and considerable variability over time is typical. However, when trends in these climate factors are observed to increase or decrease over extended periods of time (several decades or longer), this is referred to as “climate change”. 3.1.3.1 Climate Profile Using the Koppen-Geiger climate classification, Revere has a humid subtropical climate. This means the City has a temperate climate defined by hot summers and the lack of a dry season. The mean annual temperature in Revere is 50.1⁰ F, based on 30-year climate data provided by the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI). However, mean temperatures vary based on seasonal variations. Mean monthly and annual temperatures of Revere between 1991 and 2020 are displayed in Table 3-9.10 Table 3-9: Mean Monthly and Annual Temperatures in Revere Time Period Temperature (⁰F) Annual 50.7 January 28.6 April 47.8 July 73.1 October 52.9 Revere receives 48.3 inches of precipitation annually, on average, based on 30-year climate data provided by the NCEI. However, precipitation in Revere is not distributed uniformly throughout the year. Summer and winter months can be characterized as drier while months in the spring and autumn seasons are generally wetter. Average annual and monthly precipitation is displayed in Table 3-10.11 Table 3-10: Average Annual and Monthly Precipitation in Revere Time Period Precipitation (inches) Annual 48.3 January 3.8 April 4.2 July 3.5 October 4.7 10 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental information, Climate at a Glance: County Time Series, February 2021. 11 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental information, Climate at a Glance: County Time Series, February 2021.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 3.1.3.2 Changing Climate Conditions The mean temperature has experienced observable increases since weather data began being recorded in 1895. The mean annual temperature increased approximately 3.7 ⁰F since 1895. As shown in Table 3-11, the temperature in Revere has not increased uniformly throughout the year.12 For instance, the mean temperatures in April and July have increased more than those of January and October. Table 3-11: Temperature Increase Since 1895 Time Period Temperature Increase Annual 3.7 January 2.8 April 3.7 July 3.6 October 1.9 Revere has experienced an observable increase in annual precipitation since 1895. Average annual precipitation has increased approximately 6.4 inches since 1895. However, precipitation has not increased uniformly throughout the year. For instance, Revere has experienced an approximate reduction of 0.1 inches of precipitation in the month of January since 1895 while average precipitation has not changed in the month of July since 1895. Change in precipitation is displayed in Table 3-1213. Table 3-12: Changes in Precipitation Since 1895 Time Period Change in Precipitation (inches) Annual 6.4 January -0.1 April 0.4 July 0.0 October 1.9 In addition to temperature and precipitation increases resulting from climate change, the sea level of Boston Harbor has increased by 0.9 feet since 1920, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) records, exacerbating potential damages from future hazard events. 3.2 Future Climate Change Projections in Revere A review of the City’s climate, geography, and demography is necessary to understand its current risk and vulnerability to natural hazards. Furthermore, this section includes an assessment of how climate change may exacerbate the City’s risk to natural hazards, with a focus on changes in precipitation, sea level rise, rising temperature, and extreme weather. 12 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental information, Climate at a Glance: County Time Series, February 2021. 13 AECOM analysis of data provided by the National Center for Environmental Information.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 3.2.1 Changes in Precipitation As stated in the 2018 SHMCAP, changes in precipitation include changes in the amount, frequency, and timing of precipitation – including both rainfall and snowfall – are occurring across the globe as temperatures rise and other climate patterns shift in response. It is expected that precipitation will increase over this century. It is anticipated that total annual precipitation will increase by 1.0 to 6.0 inches by mid-century and by 1.2 to 7.3 inches by end of century. It is anticipated that precipitation will increase during the winter and spring months and decrease during the fall and summer months over this century. It is expected that climate change will result in more frequent, intense precipitation events in addition to more frequent extended periods of dry days. Precipitation changes are likely to exacerbate the following natural hazards: • Inland Flooding • Drought • Landslides 3.2.2 Sea Level Rise As stated in the 2018 SHMCAP, climate change will drive rising sea levels, and rising seas will have wide- ranging impacts on communities, natural resources, and infrastructure. Sea level rise is the rising water of levels resulting from meltwater of glaciers and ice sheets coupled with thermal expansion of seawater as it warms.14 The rise in relative mean sea level is projected to range from approximately 1 to 3 feet in the near term between 2000 and 2050), and from 4 to 10 feet by the end of this century (between 2000 and 2100) across the Commonwealth’s coastline (2018 SHMCAP). Sea level rise is expected to exacerbate the following natural hazards: • Coastal flooding • Coastal erosion • Tsunamis Sea level around Boston has risen by eight inches since 1950, rose by six inches between 1980 and 2016 and it is estimated the sea level around Boston will rise by another six inches in the next 15 years.15 3.2.3 Rising Temperatures As stated in the 2018 SHMCAP, average temperatures have risen steadily in the past 50 years, a trend that is expected to continue. Temperature: It is anticipated the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures will increase significantly over this century. It is anticipated the average annual temperature will increase by 2.8°F to 6.2°F by mid-century and by 3.8°F to 10.8°F by the end of this century (2018 SHMCAP). It is expected that temperatures will increase at a greater rate in winter months than in summer months. The long-term average minimum winter temperature is expected to increase by 4.6°F to 11.4°F by end of century.16 14 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Climate Change: Global Sea Level, January 2021.

There is strong evidence that storms, from heavy downpours and blizzards to tropical cyclones and hurricanes, are becoming more intense and damaging, and can lead to devastating impacts for residents. In addition, precipitation and temperature changes are expected to exacerbate extreme weather events, affecting the following natural hazards: • Hurricanes/tropical storms • Severe winter storms • Tornadoes 3.3 Natural Hazard Identification and Profile of Natural Hazards This sub-section on natural hazard identification and profile of natural hazards includes a review of natural hazards identified in the 2018 SHMCAP. The review of natural hazards is followed by a profile of each hazard deemed applicable to the City. 3.3.1 Review of Natural Hazards The 2018 SHMCAP was leveraged as the basis to identify natural hazards that have the potential to affect the City. The 2018 SHMCAP identified 14 natural hazards that have the potential to affect Massachusetts, which are organized by climate change impacts and projections, as described in Section 3.2. By framing natural hazards through the context of climate change, this Update aligns with the 2018 SHMCAP and the Commonwealth’s resilient MA Climate Change Clearinghouse website, labeled as “Primary Climate Change Interaction.” These hazards and justification for inclusion/exclusion from this Update are summarized in Table 3-13.

Does the Plan include a description of the type, location, and extent of all-natural hazards that can affect each jurisdiction(s)? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(i)) B2. Does the Plan include information on previous occurrences of hazard events and on the probability of future hazard events for each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(i)) This section of the Risk Assessment describes the type, location, and extent for each natural hazard profiled. It also assesses vulnerability, provides an overview of previous occurrences and the probability of future occurrences. While a comprehensive assessment of possible natural hazards was performed, the Risk Assessment prioritized the natural hazards with consequences that pose the greatest threat to life, property, and the environment in Revere. Resultantly, some natural hazards that are possible in Revere, such as thunderstorms, lightning, hail, and extreme precipitation, were not profiled separately. However, the consequences of these events, namely forest fires and flooding, are included in the Risk Assessment. Furthermore, hazardous weather and geologic events that pose a threat to people and the environment do not always occur independently of each other. Resultantly, some hazardous events, such as storm surge and tornadoes, are referenced under multiple natural hazard profiles. An overview of natural hazards considered is provided in Table 3-16.

Retrieved https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/terminology-index AECOM 24",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Inland flooding is generally caused by hurricanes, nor’easters, severe rainstorms, melting snowpack, and thunderstorms. Types of Flooding Events Coastal Flooding: The temporary inundation of beaches and other coastal land area, either resulting from coastal storms, hurricanes, or geologic events. Coastal flooding is profiled under Section 3.3.3.5 under Sea Level Rise. Flash Flood: Flooding that occurs with limited warning time, usually following extensive rainfall.19 Ice Jam: Flooding that results following the accumulation and build-up of floating ice fragments that block the normal flow of a river.20 Riverine/Riparian: When excessive runoff from longer-lasting rainstorms and snow melt causes a rise in the water level over a larger area.21 Storm Surge: The abnormal rise in seawater level during a storm, measured as the height of the water above the normal predicted astronomical tide. Storm surge is predominately caused by a storm’s winds pushing water onshore.22 Storm surge is captured under Hurricanes/Tropical Storms. Urban: The accumulation of floodwaters that result when the inflow of storm water exceeds the capacity of a drainage system to infiltrate water into the soil or carry it away.23 Location of Flooding Locations vulnerable to flooding in the City were determined using information from FEMA’s Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and from discussions with local officials. The FIRM flood zones, effective March 16, 2016, are provided in Appendix B. In addition, discussions with local officials identified the following flood-prone areas of the City: • Asti Avenue Neighborhood: floods consistently during combined high tide/precipitation events of greater than 1 inch. There is very limited flood storage capacity in this low-lying coastal area. • Elliot Circle: This site, adjacent to Revere Beach, experiences overtopping during combined high tide and storm events. • Point of Pines: Rock revetment and seawall along Mills Avenue is overtopped during storm events. Needs repairs from North Shore Road to River Avenue. • Cary Circle to Alden Avenue: Storm surge during high tide/storm events. • Rice Avenue near Yacht Club: Flooding due to storm surge/high tide events. • Revere Beach: The beach, from Cary Circle to Eliot Circle is overtopped by waves during high tide and coastal storm surge events. • Winthrop Parkway Neighborhood: Failing floodgate allows overtopping by storm surge and high tide during coastal storm events. 19 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Flash Flood Definition, no date.

Repetitive Loss Structures As defined by the Community Rating System (CRS) of the NFIP, a repetitive loss property is any property which the NFIP has paid two or more flood claims of $1,000 or more in any given 10-year period since 1978. More information on repetitive loss structures can be found in Section 3.4. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Severe flooding can cause damage to buildings and infrastructure. The locations susceptible to flooding, listed under Location of Flooding, cover approximately 397 acres, or 6.2 percent of the City’s land area. Assuming all structures are evenly distributed throughout the City, approximately 940 of the 15,100 structures are vulnerable to flooding. Low-lying areas and land in the FEMA-delineated SFHA are also vulnerable to flooding. In addition, the Revere MVP Summary of Findings Report identified the following areas as vulnerable to inland flooding: West/North Revere: The West / North Revere area has frontage on both the east and west sides of the Pine River and lies to the southwest of Rumney Marsh. The west side of this region of the city along the Malden border is within the FEMA 100-year floodplain. The drainage system is of particular concern in this area. Storm drainage systems on Washington Avenue and Amelia Place and catch basins on Asti Avenue and Tuscano Avenue are insufficient to manage stormwater. This results in pooling of water in these areas. Along Route 1, tide gates that are not adequately maintained exacerbate flooding within the Town Line Brook watershed. Area-wide challenges include illegal sewer hookups, downed trees, groundwater infiltration, and expansion of flood zones. Additionally, backfill on properties has reduced the area available for collecting and storing water during precipitation events. Sales Creek: The Sales Creek area lies almost entirely within the FEMA 100-year floodplain and is flanked by the Chelsea River, Belle Isle Marsh, and Broad Sound. This is a densely developed portion of Revere’s AECOM 28",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update waterfront with multiple schools, subway stations, local and State police, a transit-oriented development economic development area, and ongoing construction. Factors that increase vulnerability in this region of the city include the poor condition of water and sewer infrastructure, evacuation and emergency routes that are susceptible to flooding, and characteristics of the population that resides here — including low- income populations, non-native English speakers, renters, and newcomers — which can be more challenging to reach through the City’s conventional communication methods. Topography in this area makes low-lying areas vulnerable to flooding. The fire and police departments off Revere Beach Parkway and the police department on Ocean Avenue are identified as vulnerable locations. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of inland flooding. Changes in precipitation patterns, including more intense and frequent downpours, increase the likelihood of inland flooding as soils become saturated. Climate change is also likely to increase the frequency and intensity of severe storm events, further increasing the likelihood of inland flooding. 3.3.3.3 Drought General Definition Drought is a period of below-average precipitation in a given region, resulting in prolonged shortages in its water supply. This can include atmospheric, surface water, or groundwater. Types of Drought Events: Meteorological Drought: When dry weather patterns dominate an area. Hydrologic Drought: When low water supply becomes evident in steams, reservoirs, and groundwater levels. Hydrological drought indicators lag significantly behind meteorological drought indicators. Agricultural Drought: When precipitation deficits, soil water deficits, reduced ground water, or reduced reservoirs levels impact agricultural yields. Socioeconomic Drought: When physical drought conditions impact the supply and demand of economic goods and services. Location of Drought Because drought classifications are relative to the average local precipitation, surface, and groundwater levels, the entire City is susceptible to drought. Extent/Severity of Drought The U.S. Drought Monitor categorizes the severity of drought on scale of D0 to D4, which is outlined in Table 3-18.26 Table 3-18: USDM Drought Classification Category Description Possible Impacts D0 Abnormally Dry Going into drought: - Short-term dryness slowing planting, growth of crops, or pastures. Coming out of drought: - Some lingering water deficits. - Pastures or crops not fully recovered. D1 Moderate Drought - Some damage to crops or pastures. - Streams, reservoirs, or well low, some water shortages developing or imminent. - Voluntary water-use restrictions requested. 26 University of Nebraska-Lincoln, United States Drought Monitor, 2021.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update D2 Severe Drought - Crop or pasture losses likely. - Water shortages common. - Water restrictions imposed. D3 Extreme Drought - Major crop/pasture losses. - Widespread water shortages or restrictions. D4 Exceptional Drought - Exceptional and widespread crop/pasture losses. - Shortages of water in reservoirs, streams, and wells creating water emergencies. Massachusetts uses several indices to determine regional drought status, including the Standard Precipitation Index, crop moisture index, groundwater levels, stream flow, and reservoir levels to classify drought. Such indices were combined to develop five regional drought classifications in Massachusetts, outlined in Table 3-19.

Drought in Revere is considered a “Low Frequency” event that have a recurrence interval of between 100 and 1,000 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of a drought occurring in the City is between 1.0 and 0.1-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability While drought does not pose a significant risk to the City, it can impact agricultural production and water access to residents on private water supplies. Residents on private water supply are the most vulnerable to drought events. The City’s connection to a regional, public water supply limits the vulnerability of the community to drought events. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to result in precipitation anomalies, including prolonged dry spells and droughts. Furthermore, the likelihood of drought will increase resulting from climate change because it is anticipated that less precipitation will be in the form of snow, lessening the opportunity for groundwater recharge. 3.3.3.4 Landslides General Definition The term landslide includes a wide range of ground movements, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes, and shallow debris flows (2018 SHMCAP). The most common types of landslides in Massachusetts include translational debris slides, rotational slides, and debris flows. Most of these events are caused by a combination of unfavorable geologic conditions (silty clay or clay layers contained in glaciomarine, glaciolacustrine, or thick till deposits), steep slopes, and/or excessive wetness leading to excess pore pressures in the subsurface. Location of Landsides Landslides have the potential to occur anywhere in the City. However, landslides are more likely to occur in locations with the following characteristics or under the following circumstances27: • Steep slopes with thick deposits of unconsolidated earth materials. • River cut banks and coastal bluff areas that have been undermined by high flow/tides or storm events. 27 Maine Emergency Management Agency, State Hazard Mitigation Plan – 2019 Update. Retrieved https://www.maine.gov/mema/sites/maine.gov.mema/files/inline- files/State%20Hazard%20Mitigation%20Plan%202019%20Update_10.8.2019.pdf AECOM 31",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update • Prolonged wet periods that add water weight and reduce slope strength. According to the Slope Stability Map of Massachusetts, produced by the Massachusetts Geological Survey, most of the land in Revere is rated as stable.28 However, the Slope Stability Map identified a stretch of land adjacent to Chelsea Creek, near the Chelsea and Revere border as moderately stable. Stretches of land alongside Massachusetts 145 were also rated moderately stable while some patches of land in the northwest portion of Revere, just north of Rumney March, are rated unstable. Extent/Severity of Landslides While there is not currently an accepted standardized scale to classify land slide events, the extent of landslides can be characterized by the area of ground disturbed. Previous Occurrences While the City does not record data on landslide occurrences, there have been no known landslides in Revere. The best available data is for Suffolk County. Suffolk County has not experienced landslide events since 1950. Probability of Future Events and Changes since Previous Update Landslides in Revere are considered “Very Low Frequency” events that have a recurrence interval of greater than 1,000 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of a landslide occurring in the City is less than 0.1-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability A landslide in Revere could destroy buildings and infrastructure. While the probability of a landslide occurring in Revere is unlikely, the entire City is susceptible to damage resulting from landslides. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change could indirectly increase the frequency of landslides. Increased precipitation resulting from climate change and reduced soil stability from climate-induced drought events could trigger landslides. Sea Level Rise Sea level rise will affect risk of coastal flooding, coastal erosion, and tsunamis. 3.3.3.5 Coastal Flooding General Definition Coastal flooding is the inundation of normally dry land along the ocean coast and other inland waters from the movement of ocean water above the normal present-day tidal range. Coastal flooding is influenced by meteorological events, such as severe weather events resulting in storm surge, as well as geologic events, such as earthquake-induced tsunamis. Please note, storm surge is profiled under Hurricanes/Tropical Storms and tsunamis are profiled under Tsunamis. Locations of Coastal Flooding Coastal flooding is associated with severe coastal storms that, through the combination of winds and tides, drive tidal waters to higher levels than normally experienced, leading to the inundation of low-lying land areas and the overtopping of sea walls. Extent/Severity of Coastal Flooding The most severe storm event in Revere was the “Blizzard of ‘78” on February 6-7, 1978, which had a peak surge coinciding with a spring tide to create a 100-year water level of 14.9 feet mean low water at the National Ocean Survey Boston Harbor gauge. 28 Massachusetts Geological Survey, Slope Stability Map of Massachusetts, 2013.

Impacts on Community and Vulnerability Coastal flooding can damage buildings and infrastructure. Residents directly adjacent to the coast are most vulnerable to coastal flooding. The Revere MVP Summary of Findings Report identified the following areas as vulnerable to flooding: Beachmont: Several areas are susceptible to flooding in the southeast corner of Revere. Areas along Winthrop Parkway from the Elliot Circle to the Revere-Winthrop border and within the Winthrop Parkway Neighborhood are vulnerable to flooding. Portions of this area lie within the FEMA 100-year and 500-year floodplains. The beaches and shoreline of coastal areas and streets — such as Broad Sound Avenue — within the Beachmont area are vulnerable to sea level rise and storm surge. Streets to the north and northwest of Belle Isle Marsh Reservation, including Pearl Avenue, Belle Isle Avenue, Winthrop Avenue, and Bennington Street have experienced flooding. This region is home to schools, pump stations, a tide gate, and areas designated as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern by the State. Point of Pines/Riverside: Except for elevated areas around the Route 1A on-ramp, all the Point of Pines / Riverside area is located within the FEMA 100-year floodplain. This region of the City has widespread vulnerability to flooding. Route 1A, Mills Avenue, Rice Avenue, and Revere Beach Boulevard have experienced localized flooding and drainage issues. Residences in the neighborhoods of this area have experienced flooding and increased flood insurance rates. There are several vulnerable tide gates located along Route 1A. The Point of Pines Yacht Club, Point of Pines Beach, and associated piers, docks, and water access points are exposed to wind and storm surge. The Point of Pines Yacht Club is identified as an emergency gathering space. Oak Island/Revere Beach: Like the Beachmont and Point of Pines / Riverside areas, the Oak Island / Revere Beach area is characterized by low-lying areas within the FEMA 100-year floodplain, coastal frontage, and marshes. Non-functional flood gates and an antiquated drainage system contribute to flood vulnerability in this part of the City. Within this area, the high density of traffic along Roosevelt Avenue, Revere Street, and Broadway combined with flood vulnerability impact emergency access. Additional hazards in this area include risk of fire due to the prevalence of Phragmites in the marsh near the Wonderland Greyhound Park and coastal erosion. Populations in low-income and senior housing and schools in the Oak Island / Revere Beach area are among the vulnerable social features in this area. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of routine tidal flooding and storm- related flooding in the City. Climate change is also expected to increase the frequency and severity of severe storm events, such as hurricanes and nor’easters, that would result in more coastal flooding from storm surge. Severe storm events coupled with sea level rise could exacerbate the extent of coastal flooding. AECOM 34",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 3.3.3.6 Coastal Erosion General Definition The process by which local sea level rise, strong wave action, and coastal flooding wear down or carry away rocks, soils, and sands along the cost; all coastlines are affected by storms and other natural events that cause erosion.30 Location of Coastal Erosion Storm surges accelerate erosion along beaches and undermine sea walls, some of which are decades old. Failure of seawalls and shoreline erosion increase the vulnerability of nearby structures. Located on Broad Sound, the east facing shoreline of Revere is exposed to coastal erosion. Approximately five miles of shoreline is directly exposed, with the remaining shoreline semi-protected by offshore structures or landforms. The city is protected from coastal storms by both natural and human- made shoreline structures. There are 15 structures including 11 bulkheads/seawalls, 3 revetments, and one breakwater. Nine of these structures are owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and six are owned by the City of Revere. The Massachusetts Coastal Infrastructure Assessment Project rated the condition of 10 of these structures “B” (structures requiring limited or no repair) and the remaining five were rated “C” (structures requiring moderate to limited repair). The inventory is summarized in Table 3-22.31 Table 3-22: Inventory of Coastal Structures in Revere Primary Structure A B C D F Total Length (ft) Seawall/Bulkhead 9 2 11 21,585 Revetment 1 2 3 2,600 Breakwater 1 1 2.725 Total 10 5 15 26,890 Key A: Excellent - Like new condition. B: Good – Minor problems, superficial in nature C: Fair – Structure is sound but may have minor deterioration D: Poor – Advanced levels of deterioration; risk of damage and possible failure F: Critical – Conditions may warrant emergency stabilization According to a US Army Corps of Engineers study of Revere Beach, the coastal reach from Revere Beach to Point of Pines forms a littoral cell bordered to the southwest by Roughans Point headland and by the Saugus River estuary to the northeast. Exposure to waves from the southeast via Broad Sound and partial sheltering by Nahant Peninsula to the east combine to create a general southwest-to- northeast direction of sediment transport. Wave energy tends to focus at two locations: between Revere and Beach Streets, and at Carey Circle. In addition to flood hazards, coastal shorelines change constantly in response to wind, waves, tides, sea level fluctuation, seasonal and climatic variations, human alteration, and other factors that influence the movement of sand and material within a shoreline system.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update coastal land is a visible result of the way shorelines are reshaped in the face of these dynamic conditions. Shorelines tend to change seasonally, accreting slowly during the summer months when sediments are deposited by relatively low energy waves and eroding dramatically during the winter when sediments are moved offshore by high-energy storm waves, such as those generated by nor’easters. Regardless of the season, coastal storms typically cause erosion. With the anticipated change in climate an increase in intensity and frequency of storms is expected. Extent/Severity of Coastal Erosion A study of shoreline change in Massachusetts by the U.S. Geological Survey, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Sea Grant Program, and Cape Cod Cooperative Extension reveals that approximately 68 percent, or 513 miles, of Massachusetts' ocean- facing shore exhibits a long-term erosion trend, 30 percent, or 226 miles, shows long-term accretion, and two percent, or 15 miles, shows no net change. For the entire ocean-facing Massachusetts shore, from the mid -1800’s to 1994, the long- term average annual shoreline change rate ranges between -0.58 and 0.75 feet per year. Approximately 46 percent of the Massachusetts shore is eroding at one foot or less per year, while 22 percent of the shore is accreting at one foot or less per year. Eighty-one percent of the shore fluctuates +/-2 feet per year. Previous Occurrences Historic coastal erosion is difficult to quantify due to the extent of human interventions have altered the coast of Revere. Furthermore, Coastal shorelines change constantly in response to wind, waves, tides, sea level fluctuation, seasonal and climatic variations, human alteration, and other factors that influence the movement of sand and material within a shoreline system. While discrete storm events can accelerate coastal erosion, it is generally a continuous event resulting from earth’s processes. However, it is estimated the shoreline within the vicinity of Boston is fluctuating 0.3 feet annually.32 Probability of Future Events and Changes from Previous Update Coastal erosion in Revere is considered a “High Frequency” event that has a recurrence interval of less than 10 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of coastal erosion occurring in the City is greater than 10-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Coupled with sea level rise, coastal erosion can increase the vulnerability of residents further from the coast to coastal flooding, exacerbating the impacts of coastal flooding. Residents adjacent to the coastline are most vulnerable to coastal erosion. Impacts of Climate Change It is anticipated that sea level rise resulting from climate change will exacerbate the rate and extent of coastal erosion in Massachusetts. In general, sandy shoreline retreats landward approximately 100 feet for every foot of sea level rise (2018 SHMCAP). 3.3.3.7 Tsunamis General Definition FEMA defines tsunami as a series of enormous seismic sea waves created by an underwater disturbance caused by geologic activity in the form of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, underwater landslides, or meteorites striking the Earth. 32 Massachusetts Coastal Erosion Commission, Report of the Massachusetts Coastal Erosion Commission, December 2015.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Locations of Atlantic Based Tsunamis Tsunamis are a potential city-wide hazard in Revere. While the probability of a tsunami striking Revere is unlikely, it is assumed in the 2018 SHMCAP that a tsunami could inundate portions of the City within a mile of the coastline. Extent/Severity of Atlantic Based Tsunamis Tsunamis are typically measured by their height at the shore and the maximum run-up of the tsunami waves on the land (2018 SHMCAP). Previous Occurrences There is no historical record of tsunami events occurring in the City. Probability of Future Events and Changes from Previous Update Tsunami events in Revere are considered “Very Low Frequency” events that have a recurrence interval of greater than 1,000 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of a landslide occurring in the City is less than 0.1-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Like other forms of coastal flooding, tsunamis can damage buildings and infrastructure, and can also result in loss of life. While the likelihood of a tsunami is low, those most adjacent to the coastline are most susceptible to tsunamis. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change will increase the likelihood of tsunamis in the future. As ice melts because of climate change, the likelihood of earthquakes and submarine landslides will increase, potentially triggering tsunamis. Furthermore, the impact of collapsing glaciers may trigger tsunamis as a secondary threat following landslides. Rising Temperatures Rising temperatures will affect risk of extreme temperatures, wildfires, and invasive species. 3.3.3.8 Extreme Temperatures General Definition There is no universal definition for extreme temperatures. The term is relative to the usual weather in the region based on climatic averages. Revere has four well-defined seasons. The seasons have several defining factors, with temperature one of the most significant. Extreme temperatures can be defined as those, which are far outside of the normal seasonal ranges for Massachusetts. The average temperatures for Massachusetts are as follows: • Winter (Dec-Feb) Average: 31.8°F • Summer (Jun-Aug) Average: 71°F Extreme temperatures include extreme heat and extreme cold. Extreme Heat: Extreme heat, for this climatic region, is usually defined as a period of 3 or more consecutive days above 90 °F, but more generally a prolonged period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high humidity. Extreme cold, again, is relative to the normal climatic lows in a region. Extreme Cold: Extreme cold is more difficult to define but is relative to normal climatic lows in the region. Location of Extreme Temperatures The entire City of Revere is susceptible to extreme temperatures. AECOM 37",

Alternatively stated, the annual probability of an extreme weather event occurring in the City is greater than 10-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Extreme temperatures threaten public health and can limit access to lifeline utilities such as electricity and potable water. Residents without access to sufficient heat sources in the winter months and air conditioning in the summer months are most likely to suffer adverse effects from extreme temperatures. Vulnerable populations include low-income residents, those with limited access to climate control mechanisms, and elderly populations that are most susceptible to extreme temperatures.

Wildfires in Massachusetts are caused by natural events, human activity, or prescribed fire. Location of Wildfire Wildfires can occur throughout the City, though the following locations have been identified as having the highest potential for brush fires: • Washburn Avenue area- sparks from Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Blue Line subway cause marsh grass fires. • MBTA Blue Line subway tracks area between Wonderland Dog Track to Revere Street; sparks from vehicles’ wheels causes marsh grass fires. • MBTA Blue Line subway tracks area between Revere Street and Oak Island; subway wheel sparks cause marsh grass fires. • North Revere area: vandals. • North Shore Road: North of Oak Island to Mills Avenue and east side of Route 1A: vandals. • West of Washington Avenue from Amelia Place to Sherman Street: vandals. • Revere Beach Parkway from Pratt Avenue to Suffolk Downs: vandals set fires in marsh grass. • Bird Sanctuary at Tank Farm: vandal and lightening caused brush fires. Extent/Severity of Wildfire The severity of wildfires is measured by acres burned. Based on the locally identified known fire hazard areas, the maximum extent of potential fire damage in Revere is summarized in Table 3-25.

The remaining 10 percent included fires categorized as forest, woods or wildland fires, natural vegetation fires, other, and special outside fires, other. Only seven of these fires over the ten-year period resulted in dollar losses; and the average of these was $7,300. The Fire Chief estimates that the area impacted averages four to five acres per year. Probability of Future Events and Changes from Previous Update Wildfire events in Revere are a “High” frequency event, indicating the estimated recurrence interval is less than 10 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of a tornado occurring in Revere is greater than 10-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Wildfires can destroy buildings and result in loss of life. Residents most living adjacent to the areas listed under Locations of Wildfires are most vulnerable to their impacts. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to increase the risk of wildfires as precipitation anomalies and prolonged drought events increase the risk of wildfire. 3.3.3.10 Invasive Species General Definition Invasive species are organisms that are not native to local ecosystems. Absent native predators and competitors are often disruptive and damaging to native ecosystems, displace native species. Locations of Invasive Species Due to the massive scope of the hazard of invasive species, the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts experiences impacts of invasive species (2018 SHMCAP). Using the findings of the 2018 SHMCAP as a basis, the entire City of Revere is vulnerable to the impacts resulting from invasive species. Extent/Severity of Invasive Species Invasive species are a widespread problem throughout the City, though the geographic extent varies depending on the species in question (2018 SCHMAP). Previous Occurrences Following introduction, presence of invasive species is a continuous event that does not have discrete occurrences. Resultantly, it is difficult to measure the frequency of previous occurrences. Probability of Future Events and Changes from the Previous Update Invasive species are expected to be an increasing challenge throughout the City. Invasive species were not profiled in the previous Update. AECOM 40",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability It is rare for invasive species to directly impact humans. The entire City is vulnerable to adverse impacts from invasive species. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to facilitate the migration and introduction of invasive species to non-native ecosystems. Furthermore, it is anticipated that native ecosystems of Massachusetts will be further stressed by the impacts of climate change, including increased periods of heavy precipitation and extended drought, and increasing temperatures, making native ecosystems more vulnerable to displacement. Extreme Weather Extreme weather resulting from climate change will affect risk from the hurricanes and tropical storms, severe winter storms, and tornadoes. 3.3.3.11 Hurricanes/Tropical Storms General Definition Hurricanes are tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 74 miles per hour or greater. A tropical cyclone is a rotating low-pressure weather system. Tropical cyclones with maximum sustained surface winds of less than 39 miles per hour are classified as tropical cyclones, while tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds of 39 miles per hour or greater are classified as tropical storms. Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30.35 Types of Hurricanes/Tropical Storms Hurricanes and tropical storm events include a bundle of natural hazards. The primary hazards associated with tropical cyclones are outlined as follows: • Storm surge • Wind • Inland freshwater flooding • Tornadoes Location of Hurricanes/Tropical Storms The entire City is susceptible to strong winds, inland freshwater flooding, and tornadoes. As Revere is a coastal city, much of the land area is susceptible to storm surge. Extent of Hurricanes/Tropical Storms The strength of a hurricane is measured by the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale, which is outlined in Table 3-26.36 Table 3-26: Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale Category Sustained Types of Damage Due to Hurricane Winds Winds Tropical Up to 38 N/A Depression mph Tropical 39-73 mph N/A Storm 35 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, What is a hurricane?

As stated in the 2018 SHMCAP, 65 hurricane or tropical storm events occurred in Massachusetts between 1842 and 2017. On average, storms severe enough to receive a FEMA disaster declaration have occurred every nine years. NOAA estimates there is an average annual probability of 1-2 percent of a major hurricane making landfall in Massachusetts.37 The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Hurricanes can destroy structures and infrastructure, and result in loss of life. The entire City is susceptible to damage from hurricane winds while those in low-lying coastal areas are most susceptible to damage from hurricane storm surge. The Massachusetts Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Viewer visualizes locations in Revere vulnerable to storm surge from hurricanes. Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms, fueled by warming ocean temperatures. Furthermore, climate change is likely to increase the rate of rainfall during hurricanes, increasing the potential for inland flooding. Sea level rise will exacerbate storm surge during hurricanes. 3.3.3.12 Severe Winter Storms General Definition Severe winter storms are characterized by ice and snow accumulation, strong winds, and low temperatures. Types of Winter Storms Winter storms can include blizzards, heavy snowstorms, “nor’easters”, and sleet and ice storms.

Data for Suffolk County, which includes Revere, is the best available data to help understand previous occurrences and impacts of winter storm events. According to National Climate Data Center (NCDC) records, Suffolk County has only experienced one blizzard between 1950 and 2021, in February of 2013, which resulted in no deaths or property damage in Suffolk County. For the same time period, Suffolk County experienced 40 heavy snowfall events, resulting in no deaths, one injury and $9.582 million dollars in property damage.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Probability of Future Events and Changes from Previous Update In Massachusetts, winter storms happen multiple times each year. Winter storms are considered a “High” frequency event in Revere, indicating the estimated recurrence interval is less than 10 years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of a tornado occurring in Revere is greater than 10-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Winter snowstorms and extended cold weather are frequent hazards in New England. The impact of heavy snowfall is to impair the flow of vehicles needed for day-to-day commuting, local businesses, and public safety response. In addition, infrastructure, including critical utilities, may be impacted by winter storms and power outages and hazards to navigation and aviation can occur. During winter storms, there is an increased risk of fire due to loss of electricity and the associated use of portable heaters, gas stoves, candles, and other flammable sources of heat and light. Fire during winter storms presents a great danger because water supplies may freeze, and it may be difficult for firefighting apparatus to get to a fire. The added impacts from heavy snow and ice can affect transportation infrastructure and negatively impact both the local and regional economies. The entire City is vulnerable to impacts from severe winter storms, though marginalized communities such as elderly and low-income populations are most vulnerable to adverse effects resulting from severe winter storms. Impacts of Climate Change It is expected that climate change will increase the frequency and severity of severe winter storms. Climate change may result in increased snow fall and increased intensity of winter storms. 3.3.3.13 Tornadoes General Definition A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that extends from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud to the ground. Location of Tornadoes The location of a tornado is generally unpredictable, though historical records indicate tornadoes are less likely to strike in coastal communities such as Revere than they are to strike in inland communities across the Commonwealth. The potential remains for tornadoes to strike anywhere in the City. Extent of Tornadoes The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale is used to measure the severity of tornadoes. The Fujita Tornado Damage Scale is summarized in Table 3-31.42 Table 3-31: Enhanced Fujita Scale Scale Wind Speed – 3 Typical Effects Second Gust (mph) F0 65-85 Gale tornado (weak); light damage to chimneys; breaks twigs and branches off trees; pushes over shallow-rooted trees; damages signboards; some windows broken.

Previous Occurrences While the City does not have an extensive history of tornadoes, an F2 tornado struck the City on July 28, 2014. The tornado touched down at 9:32 am in Chelsea just south of Route 16 (Revere Beach Parkway) and moved north into Revere’s business district along Broadway, past Revere City Hall, and ended at 9:36 AM near the intersection of Routes 1 and 60 (see Figure 3-1). The path was approximately two miles long and ⅜-mile-wide, with wind speeds up to 120 miles per hour. According to Revere Fire Chief Gene Doherty 65 homes had “substantial damages” and 13 homes and businesses were uninhabitable. The city set up a shelter at a local school for displaced residents. National Grid reported that 3,000 homes were without power. Figure 3-1: Path of Revere Tornado on July 28, 2014 Probability of Future Events and Changes from Previous Update Based on the record of previous occurrences since 1950, Tornado events in Revere are a “Medium” frequency event, indicating the estimated recurrence interval ranges between 10 and 100-years.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Tornadoes can damage buildings and infrastructure and result in loss of life. While the likelihood of a tornado striking Revere is low, the entire community is vulnerable to tornadoes. Impacts of Climate Change While climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of thunderstorms and hurricanes, which can both include tornadoes, the impacts of climate change on tornadoes are not certain. 3.3.4 Non-Climate Influenced Hazards Earthquakes represent a non-climate influenced hazard that poses a risk to the City. 3.3.4.1 Earthquakes General Definition An earthquake is the vibration of the Earth’s surface that follows a release of energy in the Earth’s crust (2018 SHMCAP). Location of Earthquakes Earthquakes have the potential to affect the entire City of Revere. Massachusetts, like the other New England States, is located deep within the interior of the North American Plate; resultantly, Revere is most susceptible to intraplate earthquakes (2018 SHMCAP). Extent/Severity of Earthquakes The Richter Scale is used to measure the strength, or magnitude of an earthquake at its epicenter. While the magnitude of an earthquake measures the strength at its epicenter, intensity measures the strength of an earthquake at a given location, measured using the Mercalli Intensity Scale. The Richter Scale and Mercalli Intensity Scales are outlined in Table 3-32.43 Table 3-32: Richter Scale and Mercalli Intensity Scale Magnitude Mercalli Intensity Average Effects 1 I Microearthquakes not felt. 2 I Minor earthquakes felt slightly by some people. 3 II to III Minor earthquake often felt by people but rarely causes damage. 4 IV to V Light earthquake with noticeable shaking of indoor objects but little damage. 5 VI to VII Moderate earthquake felt by everyone and can damage poorly constructed buildings. 6 VII to IX Strong earthquake that can cause damage to well-constructed buildings. 7 VIII or greater Damages most buildings, some of which partially or completely collapse. 8 VIII or greater Major damage to buildings. Structures likely to be destroyed. 9 VIII or greater Permanent changes in ground topography.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update events in Revere are considered a “Very Low” frequency event that have a typical recurrence interval of greater than 100-years. Alternatively stated, the annual probability of an earthquake occurring in Revere is less than 1-percent. The probability of future events has not changed since the 2015 Update. Impacts on the Community and Vulnerability Earthquakes can cause damage to buildings and infrastructure. Non-reinforced masonry is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. While the likelihood of a severe earthquake impacting Revere is low, the entire City is vulnerable to earthquakes. 3.3.5 Technological and Human-Caused Hazards Dam failure is a common technological hazard that is relevant in hazard mitigation plans as the consequence of a dam failure is flooding. However, there are no dams in the City, so this hazard is not profiled. 3.3.5.1 Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is not expected to impact the frequency or severity of earthquakes. 3.4 Community Assets and NFIP Insured Structures B4. Does the Plan address NFIP insured structures within the jurisdiction that have been repetitively damaged by floods? (Requirement §201.6(c)(2)(ii)) Residents of Revere have received 1,002 NFIP payouts since 1978 from 303 flood damaged structures. NFIP payouts aggregate to $18.9 million in 2021 dollars, resulting in an average of $18,900 per payout. There are 301 repetitive loss properties in Revere. Of the 301 repetitive loss properties in Revere, 296 are residential (172 are single family residences) and five are non-residential properties. In total, four flood-prone structures in Revere have been bought out using HMA funding. 3.5 Risk Analysis and Loss Estimation The Risk Analysis and Loss Estimation describes each hazard’s impact on the community, as well as an overall summary of the community’s vulnerability pursuant to 44 CFR § 201.6 (c) (2) (ii). The findings of the Risk Analysis and Loss Estimation conducted for this update, which utilized data from FEMA’s National Risk Index (NRI), suggest that the City is most vulnerable to extreme temperatures, hurricanes and tropical storms, severe winter storms, tornadoes, and earthquakes, based on the exposed population. However, the Risk Rating, which includes a qualitative assessment of the estimated annual losses, identified inland flooding as being the greatest risk to the City at large. The NRI was leveraged to estimate the potential for negative impacts resulting from natural hazards profiled in this Risk and Vulnerability Assessment. The NRI represents the potential for negative impacts resulting from natural hazards, including estimated monetary damages.44 Table 3-34 summarizes the Risk Analysis and Annual Loss Estimation, as summarized by the NRI with the following exceptions.45 • According to NRI data, population affected for hazards with city-wide population exposure varied between 45,000 and 52,000.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update • NRI data estimated annual loss of $13.0 million from tornadoes in Revere. Because the 2014 tornado that caused $4.0 million in damages is the only recorded tornado event in 66 years of record keeping, the estimated annual loss of $13.0 million was re-estimated by assuming the 2014 tornado had a return period between 10 and 100 years (after adjusting previous damages to 2021 dollars). The estimated annual loss and risk ratings reported in Table 3-34 were sourced from the NRI. However, community input received during the planning process indicated that the estimated annual loss and risk ratings may be under-estimated for some hazards. The Massachusetts Coastal Flood Risk Model and the FEMA-delineated SFHA suggest the NRI’s estimated annual loss and risk ratings for coastal flooding and hurricanes/tropical storms under-estimate the risk they present to the City. The City’s extensive record of winter storms and the New England region’s reputation for nor’easters suggests that severe winter storms are a regular occurrence, and that the City’s risk is also under-estimated by the NRI.

FEMA defines vulnerability as the susceptibility of people, property, industry, resources, ecosystems, or historical buildings and artefacts to the negative impact of a disaster. The purpose of the vulnerability assessment is to estimate the extent of potential damages from natural hazards of varying types and intensities. The natural hazard exposure values provided in Table 3-34 monetize vulnerability to natural hazards at a high level. A qualitative summary of impacts and vulnerability resulting from each hazard profiled is provided in Table 3-35, organized by climate change interactions.

HAZUS-MH (multiple hazards) software was used to estimate damages from hurricane winds and earthquakes, using the current version at the time of the latest analysis in April 2011, using 2000 Census Data. The methodology for flooding was developed specifically to address the issue in many of the communities where flooding was not solely related to location within the FEMA-delineated Special Flood Hazard Area. 3.6.1.1 Introduction to HAZUS-MH HAZUS-MH is a computer program developed by FEMA to estimate losses resulting from a variety of natural hazards. The following overview of HAZUS-MH is taken from the FEMA website. For more information on the HAZUS-MH software, go to FEMA’s HAZUS-MH website. • “HAZUS-MH is a nationally standardized risk modeling methodology. It is distributed as free Geographic information system (GIS)-based desktop software with a collection of inventory databases for every U.S. state and territory. HAZUS-MH identifies areas with high risk for natural hazards and estimates physical, economic, and social impacts of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tsunamis. The HAZUS-MH Program, managed by FEMA’s Natural Hazards Risk Assessment Program, partners with other federal agencies, research institutions, and regional planning authorities to ensure HAZUS-MH resources incorporate the latest scientific and technological approaches and meet the needs of the emergency management community. • HAZUS-MH is used for mitigation, recovery, preparedness, and response. Mitigation planners, GIS specialists, and emergency managers use HAZUS-MH to determine potential losses from disasters and to identify the most effective mitigation actions for minimizing those losses. HAZUS-MH supports the risk assessment requirement in the mitigation planning process. Response planners use HAZUS- MH to map potential impacts from catastrophic events and identify effective strategies for response and preparedness. HAZUS-MH is also used during real-time response efforts to estimate impacts from incoming storms or ongoing earthquake sequences.” There are three modules included with the HAZUS-MH software: hurricane wind, flooding, and earthquakes. There are also three levels at which HAZUS-MH can be run. Level 1 uses national baseline data and is the quickest way to begin the risk assessment process. The analysis that follows was completed using Level 1 data. AECOM 54",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Level 1 relies upon default data on building types, utilities, transportation, etc. from national databases as well as census data. While the databases include a wealth of information on the City of Revere, it does not capture all relevant information. In fact, the HAZUS-MH training manual notes that the default data is “subject to a great deal of uncertainty.” However, for the purposes of this plan, the analysis is useful. This plan is attempting to indicate the possible extent of damages due only generally to certain types of natural disasters and to allow for a comparison between different types of disasters. Therefore, this analysis should be a starting point for understanding potential damages from the hazards. 3.6.1.2 Revisions Since 2015 Update While an additional HAZUS-MH analysis was not completed for this update, the results of the 2011 HAZUS-MH analysis were adjusted to reflect population growth and inflation. Methods used to update damage estimates are described under each respective hazard. It was assumed the 2011 HAZUS-MH analysis used 2000 US Census data and that all monetized damages were in 2002 dollars. 3.6.2 Estimated Damages from Hurricane Wind The HAZUS-MH software was used to model potential damages to the community from a 100 -year and 500-year hurricane event; storms that are 1.0% and 0.2% likely to happen each year and roughly equivalent to a Category 2 and Category 4 hurricane. The damages caused by these hypothetical storms were modeled as if the storm track passed directly through the City, resulting in the strongest winds and greatest damage potential from hurricane winds. Though there are no recorded instances of a hurricane equivalent to a 500-year storm passing through Massachusetts, this model was included to present a reasonable “worst case scenario” that would help planners and emergency personnel evaluate the impacts of storms that might be more likely in the future, as we enter a period of more intense and frequent storms. 3.6.2.1 Methods to Update Damage Estimates The estimated number of buildings damaged was escalated by 14 percent proportionate to the City’s population growth since 2000. The estimated total building replacement value was escalated by 14 percent commensurate with the increase in estimated total number buildings; this dollar value was then adjusted to 2021 dollars using the White House Office of Management and Budget Gross Domestic Product and Deflators. Similarly, the tonnage of building debris generated and number of truckloads to clear building debris were escalated by 14 percent; tree debris generated was not adjusted under the assumption that tree canopy coverage is independent of population growth. Total property damage and total losses due to business interruption were escalated by 14 percent and then adjusted to 2021 dollars. A summary of estimated damages from hurricane winds is provided in Table 3-36.

For the purposes of this plan, two earthquakes were selected: magnitude 5.0 and a magnitude 7.0. Historically, major earthquakes are rare in New England, though a magnitude 5 event occurred in 1963. The estimated total number of buildings, buildings sustaining damage, households displaced, number of people seeking shelter, building debris generated, and number of truckloads to clear building debris were escalated by 14 percent, proportionate to population growth. Estimated building replacement value, property damage, and losses due to business interruption were escalated by 14 percent commensurate with population growth and then adjusted to 2021 dollars. Tree debris generated was not adjusted under the assumption that tree canopy coverage is independent of population growth. A summary of estimated damages from earthquakes is provided in Table 3-37.

In addition to technical difficulties with the software, the riverine module is not a reliable indicator of flooding in areas where inadequate drainage systems contribute to flooding even when those structures are not within a mapped flood zone. In lieu of using HAZUS-MH, a separate methodology was developed to give a rough approximation of flood damages. Revere covers 10 square miles or 6,400 acres. Local officials have identified approximately 397 acres in Revere as vulnerable to flooding, amounting to approximately 6.2 percent of the land area in Revere. The number of structures in each flood area was estimated by applying the percentage of the total land area to the number of structures (previously assumed to be 13,335, this number was escalated to 15,142 proportionate to population growth between 2000 and 2021) in Revere; the same number of structures used by HAZUS-MH for the hurricane and earthquake calculations. The HAZUS-MH analysis described in the previous update used a value of $257,200 (2002 dollars) which was adjusted to 2021 dollars, resulting in an updated building replacement value of $370,900. This was used to calculate the total building replacement value in each of the flood areas. Low damage estimates were assumed to be 10 percent of the building replacement value while high damage estimates were assumed to be 50 percent of the building replacement values, as suggested in the FEMA September 2002 publication, “State and Local Mitigation Planning how-to guides” (Page 4-13). These calculations are not based solely on location within the floodplain or a particular type of storm. A summary of estimated damages from flooding is provided in Table 3-38.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 4. Hazard Mitigation Strategy This chapter provides Revere’s blueprint for reducing the potential losses identified in the Risk Assessment, based on existing authorities, policies, programs, and resources, and its ability to expand on and improve these existing tools. This strategy was developed using the findings of the Planning Process and Risk Assessment. The hazard mitigation strategy is made up of the following elements: • Mitigation Goals: General guidelines that represent visions for reducing or avoiding losses from the identified hazards. • Mitigation Actions: Specific projects and activities that work towards achieving mitigation goals. • Action Plan: Explains how mitigation actions will be prioritized, administered, and incorporated into the community’s existing planning mechanisms. Hazard mitigation actions eliminate or reduce long-term risk to people and property from future disasters and differ from actions taken to prepare for or respond to hazard events. Potential long-term strategies include planning, policy changes, programs, projects, and other activities. FEMA currently has the following three HMA programs that provide funding for mitigation activities: • Hazards Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) • Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) – previously known as Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) • Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Hazard mitigation actions can generally be sorted into the following groups: • Local Plans and Regulations: Include land-use policies or codes that influence the way land and buildings are developed and built. • Structure and Infrastructure Projects: Involve modifying existing structures and infrastructure to lessen exposure to a hazard or remove them from a hazard area. • Natural Systems Protection: Actions that minimize damage and losses and preserve or restore the functions of natural systems. • Education and Awareness Programs: Actions inform and educate stakeholders about potential hazards and opportunities to mitigate their impacts. The Hazard Mitigation Strategy begins with the City’s Capability Assessment, which identifies existing authorities, policies, programs, and resources and its ability to expand on and improve existing policies and programs. Because natural disasters, particularly large-scale, are not typically limited to a single jurisdiction, the Capability Assessment continues with a review of Regional and Inter-Community Considerations. The Capability Assessment concludes with a summary of Revere’s participation in the NFIP. 4.1 Capability Assessment C1. Does the plan document each jurisdiction’s existing authorities, policies, programs, and resources and its ability to expand on and improve these existing policies and programs? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)) AECOM 59",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 4.1.1 Overview of Existing Authorities, Policies, Programs, and Resources Performing a Capability Assessment is one step of a successful hazard mitigation plan update process. A mitigation planning Capability Assessment consists of taking an in-depth look at existing community resources (such as plans, codes, ordinances, staffing, etc.) to assess which capabilities contribute to vulnerability by reducing or exacerbating disaster impacts. Understanding what capabilities need to be changed or enhanced to reduce disaster losses allows the planning team to address those shortfalls in the mitigation strategy. Performing the Capability Assessment helps communities identify the regulatory, administrative, technical, and fiscal capacities and capabilities of their jurisdiction and consider ways that these existing tools can be used to further their hazard mitigation and disaster resiliency goals. The City of Revere completed its first Capability Assessment in 2021, guided by AECOM Technical Services, Inc. (AECOM) and the process outlined in FEMA’s Local Mitigation Planning Handbook. A virtual meeting was held on April 8, 2021. Attendees included representatives from AECOM and City Planning. AECOM provided background information on the Capability Assessment process (its purpose and benefits), presented an overview of the worksheet content, and then began to assist the City with documenting its responses. Time did not allow for the assessment to be completed during the time allotted for the virtual meeting; therefore, City Planning coordinated the completion of the balance of the assessment. The worksheet used to conduct the Capability Assessment consisted of Worksheet 4.1 from FEMA’s Local Mitigation Planning Handbook. As part of this assessment and as recommended in the Handbook, the City also conducted a Safe Growth Audit and an assessment of its NFIP participation. Safe Growth Audits allow communities to further evaluate the ways that their existing policies, ordinances, and plans are driving growth and how risks may be increasing under these current conditions. The Safe Growth Audit completed by the City of Revere is documented on Worksheet 4.2 of FEMA’s Local Mitigation Planning Handbook. As a participant in FEMA’s NFIP since 1974, the City of Revere has inherently developed and enhanced its local capabilities in terms of flood mitigation. As part of its Capability Assessment the City evaluated its participation in the NFIP and ways that they will continue to comply with the program’s requirements in the future. To facilitate this portion of the assessment, the City completed Worksheet 4.3 from FEMA’s Local Mitigation Planning Handbook. AECOM has summarized the City’s worksheet responses in this plan section, describing local activities currently reported to be underway which contribute to, or can be utilized for, hazard mitigation. The City of Revere has used this assessment process as a tool for informing its mitigation strategy, to be sure that proposed projects, funding streams, and timeframes for completion align with local resources, abilities, and limitations. State and Federal resources (such as technical assistance, funding streams, etc.) can also be used by local communities like Revere to supplement and enhance resources available at the local level. These outside resources, as related to hazard mitigation, are summarized at the end of this section. 4.1.2 Capabilities and Resources – City of Revere 4.1.2.1 Planning and Regulatory The City of Revere has several policies, programs, and capabilities which help to prevent and minimize future damages resulting from hazards (Table 4-1). These tools are valuable instruments in pre- and post- disaster mitigation as they facilitate the implementation of mitigation activities through the City’s current legal and regulatory framework.

Administrative capability is determined by evaluating whether there are an adequate number of personnel to complete mitigation activities. Similarly, technical capability can be evaluated by assessing the level of knowledge and technical expertise of local government employees, such as personnel skilled in surveying and Geographic Information Systems.

Other Yes The City DPW has recently added a new full-time position, “Chief of DPW-new Infrastructure”. This has improved coordination both within the City (i.e., FT position site plan review) and externally (i.e., between the City and other outside agencies). The City of Revere does not have a conservation agent to enforce wetlands bylaws; this position would be very beneficial as most of the City’s new development is in the floodplain. The City also has created North Suffolk Office of Resiliency and Sustainability, a regional office between Revere, Chelsea, and Winthrop. Two new positions will be filled before the HMP is adopted. One person for resiliency, and one for sustainability. These two new positions are shared across all three member municipalities. Both of these positions are full-time, but each person is only 1/3 dedicated to Revere. The City Engineer completed Illicit Discharge & Detection Elimination training in 2021. The City recently added the position of Open Space and Environmental Planner / Resiliency Coordinator; this is a full-time position.

Safe Growth Audit The FEMA Local Mitigation Planning Handbook indicates that one way to assess the impact of planning and regulatory capabilities is to complete a safe growth audit. The purpose of the safe growth audit is to analyze the impacts of current policies, ordinances, and plans on community safety from hazard risks due to growth.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 4.1.2.4 Conclusion This Capability Assessment finds that the City of Revere has a significant level of planning and regulatory, technical, and administrative, financial, and education and outreach tools and resources at its disposal to implement hazard mitigation initiatives. Additionally, as part of this Capability Assessment, the City of Revere also considered ways of improving or enhancing their capabilities to achieve better alignment with the City’s long-term mitigation goals. Like many communities in Massachusetts and across the nation, the City of Revere generally finds its most significant resource constraints to be related to staffing and funding. Some intermunicipal agreements have allowed the City to supplement its core staff with shared services or shared staff members with its neighboring jurisdictions. While this approach has helped, City staff responsibilities still tend to exceed available time constraints. With regard to financial constraints, the City’s funds are indeed limited, and its budget is tight; however, local officials actively pursue grant funding streams wherever possible to supplement project costs and stretch every tax dollar for the greatest benefit to the municipality. 4.1.3 Capabilities and Resources – Commonwealth of Massachusetts The 2018 SHMCAP includes a detailed evaluation of the State’s authorities, laws, policies, programs, staff, funding, and other resources available to the Commonwealth to support hazard mitigation and climate adaptation efforts. The Commonwealth has a long history of demonstrating its commitment to advancing risk reduction and resilience across the state. This encompasses a broad range of State- supported initiatives and activities that include a combination of outreach, training, technical assistance, funding, partnerships, regulatory codes and statutes, infrastructure projects, and other activities to increase statewide resilience. An overview of some key capabilities and resources are summarized in Table 4-10. For more details, interested persons should refer to the SHMCAP, Chapter 6, online at https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/09/17/SHMCAP-September2018-Chapter6.pdf. This capability assessment finds that the Commonwealth’s various departments collectively have a significant level of legal, technical, and fiscal tools and resources necessary for implementation of hazard mitigation strategies, and that many of these programs and initiatives can be used to support the activities of local municipalities. Excerpts from examples included in the SHMCAP are provided below. The State Plan should be referred to directly for more specifics (on the web at https://www.mass.gov/service- details/massachusetts-integrated-state-hazard-mitigation-and-climate-adaptation-plan).

Under the MVP planning program, the Commonwealth awards funding to communities to complete vulnerability assessments and develop action-oriented resiliency plans. Capital Investment Plan This plan provides funding for the Commonwealth’s capital needs, with a critical new component of climate change preparedness and resiliency. Statewide Resilience Master Plan The SRMP identifies and addresses potential climate impacts to State facility (SRMP) assets. Coastal Resilience Grant Program This program funds the non-Federal match for NOAA Regional Coastal Resilience Grants and provides 50% of the non-Federal share of the costs of major local flood control projects developed in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). FEMA HMGP Grant Cost Share The State contributes funding toward FEMA HMGP grant cost share to offset Supplemental Funds local hazard mitigation project costs. From 1991 to 2018, the State contributed more than $27 million under this initiative. State Building Code The Commonwealth requires local governments to use a nationally applicable model building code that addresses natural hazards (including wind, flood, snow, seismic, and other hazards) as a basis for design and construction of new buildings and any State-sponsored mitigation projects. The 9th Edition of the State Building Code became effective October 20, 2017, and is based on modified versions of the 2015 International Codes (I-Codes), as published by the International Code Council (ICC). Under the 9th Edition, the design and construction of buildings and structures located in flood hazard areas must be in accordance with American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) standards, which are consistent with, and in some cases, exceed minimum NFIP requirements. The Commonwealth routinely The State’s Disaster Recovery Manager at the Massachusetts Emergency integrates risk reduction into its Management Agency (MEMA) also oversees the Mitigation Unit, providing post-disaster response and seamless coordination with the implementation of post-disaster mitigation and recovery operations recovery programs, including FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, PA program, and Individuals and Households Program.

Coastal A Zone Mapping: To improve coastal flood hazard mapping in Massachusetts, DCR and CZM recently partnered to map the delineation of Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA) for 15 coastal communities. LiMWA is the inland limit of the area expected to receive 1.5-foot or greater breaking waves during the 1 percent annual chance flood event. FEMA FIRMs that went into effect in 2009-2013 for Massachusetts coastal counties were based on studies initiated in 2005 and did not include LiMWA lines. The addition of the LiMWA to FIRMs allows communities and individuals to better understand the flood risks to their property.

In 2018, the Commonwealth initiated the development of a new State Disaster Recovery Plan. 4.1.4 Capabilities and Resources – Federal The Federal government offers a wide range of funding and technical assistance programs that can be accessed by municipalities to foster local hazard mitigation initiatives and support community resiliency. Some of these programs are geared to disaster preparedness and mitigation planning, while the focus of others is the long-term vitality of the communities. Table 4-11 presents a summary of Federal funding sources available for mitigation activities. It should be emphasized that the capabilities and resources summarized in Table 4-11 present a high- level overview of some key resources that are most relevant to hazard mitigation and mitigation planning; it is not a comprehensive list. Further information on these and other Federal programs can be found in the Assistance Listings online at www.beta.sam.gov. This site allows users to browse federal assistance listings across all government agencies and download a copy of the latest Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. This capability assessment finds that the various Federal agencies collectively have a significant level of resources that support local implementation of hazard mitigation strategies and that can be accessed to support the activities of local municipalities.

The program is divided into two distinct funding pots: State grants, and Federal acquisition funds. The Forest Legacy Availability: Participation in Forest Legacy is limited to private forest landowners. Program (FLP) Description: Federal program in partnership with States, supports State efforts to protect environmentally sensitive forest lands. Designed to encourage the protection of privately-owned forest lands, FLP is an entirely voluntary program. To maximize the public benefits it achieves, the program focuses on the acquisition of partial interests in privately owned forest lands. FLP helps the States develop and carry out their forest conservation plans. It encourages and supports acquisition of conservation easements, legally binding agreements transferring a negotiated set of property rights from one party to another, without removing the property from private ownership. Most FLP conservation easements restrict development, require sustainable forestry practices, and protect other values. To qualify, landowners are required to prepare a multiple resource management plan as part of the conservation easement acquisition. The federal government may fund up to 75 percent of project costs, with at least 25 percent coming from private, State, or local sources. In addition to gains associated with the sale or donation of property rights, many landowners also benefit from reduced taxes associated with limits placed on land use. In 2008, NJ has one project funded: Sparta Mountain South at $2,474,000. Transportation Trust Availability: Pre- and post-disaster Fund (TTF) Description: Grants are funded by the TTF through a competitive application-based process administered by the Local Aid District Offices. The County Aid Program is funded through the TTF and provides funding for eligible costs of projects included in the County’s approved Annual Transportation Program. The program is intended for road and bridge infrastructure improvements under county jurisdiction. Each County receives an annual formula-based allotment that takes into consideration county road lane mileage and population. 4.1.4.1 Other Resources – Documents FEMA has developed many documents that address implementing hazard mitigation at the local level. Key resource documents are briefly described here. Local Mitigation Planning Handbook. This handbook is the official guide for local governments to develop, update and implement local mitigation plans. While federal requirements have not changed, the Handbook provides revised and expanded guidance, offering practical approaches, tools, worksheets, and local mitigation planning examples for how communities can engage in effective planning to reduce long-term risk from natural hazards and disasters. The Handbook can be found on the FEMA web site at: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/fema-local-mitigation-planning-handbook_03-2013.pdf Mitigation Ideas: A Resource for Reducing Risk to Natural Hazards.

The purpose of this document is to provide succinct and practical information to local government officials on how to best integrate hazard mitigation into the full range of community planning activities. It is intended for those who are engaged in any type of local planning, but primarily community planners and emergency managers that bear responsibility for hazard mitigation planning. This resource can be found on the FEMA web site at: http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1908-25045- 0016/integrating_hazmit.pdf How-to Guides. FEMA has developed a series of nine “how-to guides” to assist States, communities, and tribes in enhancing their hazard mitigation planning capabilities. The first four guides mirror the four major phases of hazard mitigation planning used in the development of the Rensselaer County Multi- Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan. The last five how-to guides address special topics that arise in hazard mitigation planning such as using benefit-cost analysis and integrating man-made hazards. The use of worksheets, checklists, and tables make these guides a practical source of guidance to address all stages of the hazard mitigation planning process. They also include special tips on meeting DMA 2000 requirements. Post-Disaster Hazard Mitigation Planning Guidance for State and Local Governments. FEMA, Disaster Assistance Policy (DAP)-12, September 1990. This handbook explains the basic concepts of hazard mitigation and shows State and local governments how they can develop and achieve mitigation goals within the context of FEMA’s post-disaster hazard mitigation planning requirements. The handbook focuses on approaches to mitigation, with an emphasis on multi-objective planning. Mitigation Resources for Success CD. FEMA 372, September 2001. This CD contains a wealth of information about mitigation and is useful for State and local government planners and other stakeholders in the mitigation process. It provides mitigation case studies, success stories, information about Federal mitigation programs, suggestions for mitigation measures to homes and businesses, appropriate relevant mitigation publications, and contact information. A Guide to Federal Aid in Disasters. FEMA 262, April 1995. When disasters exceed the capabilities of State and local governments, the President’s disaster assistance program (administrated by FEMA) is the primary source of Federal assistance. This handbook discusses the procedures and process for obtaining this assistance and provides a brief overview of each program. The Emergency Management Guide for Business and Industry. FEMA 141, October 1993. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to emergency management planning, response, and recovery. It also details a planning process that companies can follow to better prepare for a wide range of hazards and emergency events. This effort can enhance a company’s ability to recover from financial losses, loss of market share, damages to equipment, and product or business interruptions. This guide could be of great assistance to Rensselaer County industries and businesses located in hazard prone areas. 4.1.4.2 Other Resources - Websites The following are important websites that provide focused access to valuable planning resources for communities interested in sustainable development initiatives. • http://www.fema.gov: Web site of the Federal Emergency Management Agency includes links to information, resources, and grants that communities can use in planning and implementation of sustainable measures.

Online resources provide information on natural hazards, community land use, and ways you can protect your property from damage. 4.1.5 Regional and Inter-Community Considerations Some hazard mitigation actions are strictly local. The vulnerability being addressed is limited to the municipality and can be solved at the local level. Other mitigation actions address inter-community vulnerabilities that require cooperation between two or more municipalities in a local area. There is a third level of mitigation which is regional; involving a state, regional, or federal agency or an issue that involves numerous municipalities across a wide area of the metropolitan region. This section summarizes the City’s capacity and existing strategies to coordinate beyond the boundaries of Revere. 4.1.5.1 Regional Partners In many communities, mitigating natural hazards, particularly flooding, is more than a local issue. The drainage systems that serve these communities are a complex system of storm drains, roadway drainage structures, pump stations and other facilities owned and operated by a wide array of agencies including but not limited to the City of Revere, the DCR, and MassDOT. The planning, construction, operations, and maintenance of these structures are integral to the flood hazard mitigation efforts of communities. These agencies must be considered the communities regional partners in hazard mitigation. These agencies also operate under the same constraints as communities do, including budgetary and staffing constraints and numerous competing priorities. In the sections that follow, the plan includes recommendations for activities where cooperation with these other agencies may be necessary. Implementation of these recommendations will require that all parties work together to develop solutions. Also, Revere will continue to support and be involved with the following working groups to support regional climate change adaptation and hazard mitigation efforts: • Resilient Mystic Collaborative (Mystic River Watershed Association) • North Suffolk Office of Resiliency and Sustainability (Revere, Winthrop, and Chelsea) • Saugus Pines River Collaborative (Revere, Saugus, Lynn, Malden, and Everett) • Metro Mayors Climate Task Force (Metropolitan Planning Area Council) 4.1.5.2 Inter-Community Considerations North Revere Brush Fires: Plan participants identified regional brush fire prevention in North Revere, in collaboration with the Town of Saugus, as a natural hazard issue of regional concern. This is a salt marsh area bisected by the Pine River and State Route 107 (Salem Turnpike), and an MBTA commuter rail line. This area, bordered by Saugus and Revere are often the target for vandals setting brush fires, as well as prone to fires started by sparks from braking trains landing on dry salt marsh grasses. The two AECOM 79",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update communities would like to cooperate to create public awareness of the problem, increase access to the marsh area and establish a cooperative mutual aid firefighting agreement to increase fire prevention and protection within North Revere and Saugus. Sea Level Rise and Shoreline Environment: The coastal shoreline of the North Shore area is a dynamic environment where forces of sea-level rise, erosion, and deposition of are constantly at work changing the shoreline profile. This process disregards municipal boundaries as sand and other materials are moved along the coast. Shoreline protection measures such as sea walls, jetties, and others have an impact on this process with the potential of building up materials in some areas while stripping it away from others. In Revere, a shoreline issue of regional concern is the need for additional storm water and storm surge storage capacity. Though the City has made substantial progress over the decade in updating its drainage and water infrastructure, the City has expressed the need for a regional approach to adding additional storm water storage capacity by dredging both Town Line Brook and Trifone Brooks. This additional capacity would benefit Everett, Malden and Chelsea, as well as Revere. Municipalities along the North Shore should work to understand how these processes and others associated with sea level rise and storm surge are at work locally and consider mutually beneficial means of protecting their shore side communities from the impacts of storm damage and sea-level rise. Revere should consider participating within a regional sea level rise action work group to help plan for and address sea level rise, storm surge and related climate adaptation issues on a regional basis. 4.1.6 Participation in the National Flood Insurance Program C2. Does the plan address each jurisdiction’s participation in the NFIP and continued compliance with NFIP requirements, as appropriate? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(ii)) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) – Revere is a participating community in the NFIP with 2,274 policies in force as of February 23, 2021. Since the 2015 Update, the policies in force have increased by 562. More information on NFIP claims and payouts in Revere can be found in Section 3.4. 4.2 Hazard Mitigation Goals C3. Does the Plan include goals to reduce/avoid long‐term vulnerabilities to the identified hazards? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(i)) The Planning Committee approved of the Hazard Mitigation Goals at the April 27, 2021 Planning Committee Meeting #2. At that meeting, the team reviewed and discussed the goals from the 2015 Hazard Mitigation Plan for the City of Revere and agreed to carry them forward in the 2022 Update. Table 4-12 presents the right goals that were endorsed by the Planning Committee for the 2022 Update of the Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan: Table 4-12: Hazard Mitigation Goals Number Description 1 Ensure that critical infrastructure sites are protected from natural hazards 2 Protect existing residential and business areas from flooding. 3 Make efficient use of public funds for hazard mitigation. 4 Continue to enforce zoning and building regulations. 5 Educate the public about zoning and building regulations, particularly with regard to changes in regulations that may affect teardowns and new construction. 6 Encourage future development in areas that are not prone to natural hazards. AECOM 80",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Number Description 7 Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures. 8 Protect the City's ability to respond to various natural hazard events. 4.3 Mitigation Actions C4. Does the Plan identify and analyze a comprehensive range of specific mitigation actions and projects for each jurisdiction being considered to reduce the effects of hazards, with emphasis on new and existing buildings and infrastructure? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(ii)) Table 4-14 identifies a comprehensive list of specific mitigation actions and projects within Revere that are being considered to reduce the effects of hazards, with an emphasis on the build environment, which includes new and existing buildings and infrastructure. D2. Was the plan revised to reflect progress in local mitigation efforts? (Requirement §201.6(d)(3)) At a meeting of Planning Committee, City staff reviewed the potential mitigation actions identified in the 2015 Update and determined whether each measure had been implemented or deferred, as displayed in Table 4-13. Mitigation actions from the 2015 Update, identified in Table 4-13, were updated to reflect progress in local mitigation efforts.

The decision on whether to delete or retain a particular measure was based on the Planning Committee’s assessment of the continued relevance or effectiveness of the measure and whether the deferral of action on the measure was due to the inability of the City to take action on the measure. 4.3.1 Prioritization of Mitigation Actions C5. Does the Plan contain an action plan that describes how the actions identified will be prioritized (including cost benefit review), implemented, and administered by each jurisdiction? (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(iv)); (Requirement §201.6(c)(3)(iii)) The last step in developing the City’s mitigation strategy is to assign a level of priority to each mitigation measure to guide the focus of the City’s limited resources towards those actions with the greatest potential benefit. At this stage in the process, the Planning Committee has limited access to detailed analyses of the cost and benefits of any given measure, so prioritization is based on the Planning Committee member’s institutional knowledge of the existing and potential hazard impacts and an approximate sense of the costs associated with pursuing any given measure. Prioritization occurred through discussion with the Planning Committee and through subsequent review by the Planning Committee members and public comment. Priority setting was based on local knowledge of the hazard areas, including impacts of hazard events and the extent of the area impacted and the relation of a given mitigation measure to the City’s identified goals. In addition, through the discussion, the Planning Committee also took into consideration factors such as the number of homes and businesses affected, whether or not road closures occurred and what impact closures had on delivery of emergency services and the local economy, anticipated project costs, whether the City currently had the technical and administrative capability to carry out the mitigation measures, whether any environmental constraints existed, and whether Revere would be able to justify the costs relative to the anticipated benefits. Table 4-14 reflects the prioritized mitigation actions and projects being considered by the City to reduce the effects of hazards. AECOM 84",

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 4.4 Integration with Other Planning Mechanisms C6. Does the Plan describe a process by which local governments will integrate the requirements of the mitigation plan into other planning mechanisms, such as comprehensive or capital improvement plans, when appropriate? (Requirement §201.6(c)(4)(ii)) As stated in Section 2.2, the City recognizes hazard mitigation planning should not occur independent of other community planning activities. The City has held stakeholder workshops to support the Revere MVP Program and workshops specific to the Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study for the Point of Pines Riverside Area. Stakeholder engagement activities taken to support these efforts are summarized in the following sections. Many measures identified in previous plan updates are now considered on-going aspects of the regular work of City staff from the department head level to the regular work of Public Works staff. Individual projects have been incorporated into the City’s capital improvement plan and the City continues to seek FEMA HMA funding to implement the home elevation program. There will be more opportunities to incorporate hazard mitigation into the City’s decision-making processes. Barriers to implementing many mitigation actions are primarily a result of funding and staffing constraints. The following ongoing initiatives and planning mechanisms are integrating requirements of the mitigation plan to improve community resilience: • Coastal Resilience Study for Riverside and Point of Pines – MVP Action Grant • Suffolk Downs redevelopment Regional and Inter-Community Considerations are further discussed in Section 4.1.5. Lastly, the Planning Committee encompasses an interdisciplinary group of stakeholders from the City, and includes representation from first responders and emergency managers, planning and development, engineers and infrastructure operators, and the City’s school department. In addition, the Planning Committee includes stakeholder who represent community members with access and functional needs. Through encompassing an interdisciplinary set of stakeholders, the Planning Committee can integrate the findings of the risk assessment and mitigate strategy into other municipal plans and response procedures, where appropriate.

        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 5. Plan Adoption and Maintenance The Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan was adopted by the City Council on [ADD DATE]. See Appendix C for documentation. The plan was approved by FEMA on [ADD DATE] for a five-year period that will expire on [ADD DATE]. 5.1 Public Participation during Plan Maintenance A5. Is there discussion of how the community(ies) will continue public participation in the plan maintenance process? (Requirement §201.6(c)(4)(iii)) Planning is a dynamic and ongoing process, and as such, the 2022 Update will be reviewed annually between formal approval and the beginning of the next update to internally review and update the hazard mitigation strategy / action status. The Planning Committee will morph into the Implementation Committee and will continue to meet on an annual basis to function as the Local Hazard Mitigation Implementation Committee, with the Emergency Management Director designated as the coordinator. Additional members could be added to the local implementation group from businesses, non-profits, and institutions. The City will continue public participation during the next 5-year planning cycle. Updates and reviews of the plan will be publicly noticed in accordance with City and state open meeting laws, and the current plan will be available to the public on the City's website. Furthermore, the 2022 Update will be posted on the City’s website, allowing for public review and comment throughout the plan’s 5-year lifecycle. 5.2 Keeping the Plan Current A6. Is there a description of the method and schedule for keeping the plan current (monitoring, evaluating and updating the mitigation plan within a 5‐year cycle)? (Requirement §201.6(c)(4)(i)) 5.2.1 Implementation and Maintenance Schedule The City will conduct annual plan maintenance meetings in the Fall to internally review and update the hazard mitigation strategy / action status. Furthermore, the coordinator of the Implementation Committee will prepare and distribute a survey in year three of the plan. The survey will be distributed to all the local implementation group members and other interested local stakeholders. The survey will poll the members on any changes or revisions to the plan that may be needed, progress and accomplishments for implementation, and any new hazards or problem areas that have been identified. This information will be reflected in the planning section of the subsequent plan update. The Implementation Committee will have primary responsibility for tracking progress and Planning Committee will again be responsible for subsequent updates of the plan. 5.2.2 Begin to Prepare for the next Plan Update Given the lead time needed to secure funding and conduct the planning process, the Planning Committee will begin to prepare for an update of the plan in year three. The Planning Committee will use the information collected during the annual review process to identify the needs and priorities for the next plan update and seek funding for the plan update process. Potential sources of funding may include FEMA HMA, which includes BRIC and HMGP funding. Both grant programs can pay for 75% of a planning project, with a 25% local cost share required. AECOM 98",
        "Hazard Mitigation Plan Update 5.2.3 Prepare and Adopt an Updated Local Hazard Mitigation Plan FEMA’s approval of this plan is valid for five years, by which time an updated plan must be approved by FEMA to maintain the City’s approved plan status and its eligibility for FEMA HMA. Once the resources have been secured for the next update, the Planning Committee will need to review the current FEMA hazard mitigation plan guidelines for any changes. The update of the Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan will then be forwarded to MEMA and DCR for review and to FEMA for approval. 5.2.4 Integration of the Plans with Other Planning Initiatives Upon FEMA approval and adoption of the 2022 Update, the Local Hazard Mitigation Implementation Committee will provide all interested parties and implementing departments with a copy of the plan and will initiate a discussion regarding how the plan can be integrated into that department’s ongoing work. Discussions will focus on how recommendations in the 2022 Update can be integrated into the City’s capital improvement planning program, master planning process, zoning, wetlands, and stormwater or subdivision regulations. At a minimum, the 2022 Update will be reviewed and discussed with the following departments: • Fire / Emergency Management • Police • Public Services / Highway • Engineering • Planning and Community Development • Conservation • Parks and Recreation • Health • Building The findings of the 2022 Update will be integrated into other city planning initiatives and policies as they are updated and renewed, including the Revere Comprehensive Plan, Open Space Plan, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, and Capital Investment Program. Other groups that will be coordinated with include large institutions, Chambers of Commerce, land conservation organizations and watershed groups. The plans will also be posted on a community’s website with the caveat that local team coordinator will review the plan for sensitive information that would be inappropriate for public posting. The posting of the plan on a web site will include a mechanism for citizen feedback such as an e-mail address to send comments. AECOM 99",

A PDF of the presentation is attached to these notes and provides additional details. • Elle introduced the project, previous meeting items and actions. • Aaron Weieneth provided welcome and opening remarks to the group and proceeded to give an overview of HMP agenda and materials to be covered. 2.0 Importance of Hazard Mitigation Plan Update (Led by Anna Foley) • Anna Foley took over presentation and asked the group who has been involved in HMP planning before. ─ Elle indicated she had not been involved but works closely on the City’s related Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) work. Frank Stringi was involved with the previous HMP update. • Anna reviewed why hazard mitigation is important: combination of factors that dictate the degree of impact felt when a disaster occurs. • Hazard mitigation planning is the key to resiliency because natural hazards are inevitable. Communities need to have a well-rounded understanding of all vulnerabilities, not just the most recent events that have caused issues. This process will allow the City to make better informed decisions of how to allocate resources. • Hazard mitigation breaks the cycle of hazards becoming disasters. It reduces exposure, saves communities money, and protects property and lives. • In 2018, the Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council performed a study of cost-effective grant funded mitigation projects and found those projects provided towns with 6:1 cost savings. • Disaster Mitigation Act (2000) added a new requirement for local communities to have HMPs in place to be eligible to apply for federal hazard mitigation project grant money. Previously, the eligibility requirement was tied to the State having a mitigation plan in place. • HMPs are living documents and need to be continually updated on an ongoing basis, at least every 5 years, to address natural hazards. • Benefits of mitigation planning include compliance with DMA2000 and ability to apply for project grants, create a path to resiliency, facilitates putting together funding applications, applications will be more competitive. • Once the plan is approved, various projects fall under FEMA’s funding opportunities (listed on slide). • Regular updates of the HMP ensure information in population, development, FEMA mapping, recent hazard and associated impacts, and recent outlier events is up to date and represents the City’s best path forward. 1 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #1 1/20/2021",
        "HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Minutes • A 5-year HMP update reflects current conditions and changes. ─ Elle noted 1,200-1,500 additional housing units. ─ Frank said since 2014 they have added about 3,500 units, major area along Revere Beach Blvd, 850 in permitting stage at Suffolk Downs. ─ Anna noted that increases level of risk since more people and property will be in harm’s way in the event of a natural disaster. 3.0 What is included in a plan update? (Anna Foley reviewed information on PowerPoint) • A 5-year window starts the date the plan was adopted, which is why we reference first plan update as 2015 (though the bulk of the City’s first plan update activities occurred in 2014). • This second plan update should be completed by the end of 2021. • The 2015 plan focused on 8 hazards that were prominent in the state plan at the time of first plan update. • Anna stressed how important outreach is for the plan update, to both the general public and other stakeholders. Outreach must be documented throughout the plan update timeline where various avenues are used to reach those groups of people. For example, there should be digital outreach, hard copies posted in public venues, and brought up in regularly scheduled City meetings. ─ Elle Baker noted the City could conduct a survey of some sort through Revere TV and their website. She referenced their current practices for public outreach for open space planning and the RiverFront Master Plan. Need to coordinate the best avenues for outreach. Recently applied for a flood barrier application with 5 other communities. Working with Chelsea and Winthrop on other initiatives, so Revere is okay with contacting other communities to weigh in. ─ Bob O’Brien added that outreach in Revere needs to be multi-lingual as was done for the City’s recent Master Plan so it is broad enough to reach everyone in their diverse community. He referenced recent translations of City documents into Spanish, Portuguese, Cambodian, and Arabic. • Anna recommended discussing the plan update at regularly scheduled meetings open to the public – things like council meetings, planning board meetings, etc. that are already advertised and open to the public. Though unrelated to this project, those meetings offer an opportunity to share brief information about the plan update and where to go for more information, to submit comments, or to become involved. This approach casts a wider net, as it is sometimes difficult to realize high attendee numbers at meetings designed strictly to discuss the HMP; people sometimes do not come out unless it is a post-disaster situation where natural hazards are front and center in everyone’s minds. Additionally, use newsletters, newspapers, community TV, radio, etc. She also noted that reaching out to neighboring communities allows doors of communication to open, since natural hazards do not recognize municipal boundaries. It is good to initiate conversations to invite neighboring communities to learn more and/or become involved. Also, channels of communication can bring to light things that may be occurring in neighboring communities that have impacts (negative or positive) on Revere, and vice versa. It is also good to coordinate if neighboring communities are planning, or presently undergoing, a similar HMP project. • Who are “other stakeholders”? Anna briefly touched on a list of examples. In short, they are not municipal employees, and are not the general public. A full list is on slide #29 of the attached PowerPoint. • Anna noted that it is important to make sure that that City is documenting outreach over the project timeline so it is not a red flag at the end; for example if there is only one outreach platform used, or if all outreach activities are conducted in the last month of the project timeline, that is not a good sign. • Anna handed presentation back over to Aaron who described the plan update fact sheet. • Aaron reviewed the project timeline starting with completed items and then the key future activities and related dates. ─ Aaron noted he has been in touch with the plan reviewer from the State, and he has a good track record with getting plans reviewed in a timely manner. 4.0 General Discussion / Q&A • Bob O’Brien asked if we could identify infrastructure projects now that a new administration has taken over. 2 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #1 1/20/2021",
        "HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Minutes ─ Anna responded that projects in the action lists all fall under different funding streams so yes, when you prepare project list, the better idea you have of where you will seek funding from in planning stage it is better for your municipality. It is best to document a variety of funding sources, not strictly FEMA funding streams. ─ Bob responded that they will need a list because they could be provided with funding opportunities sooner rather than later. Riverfront Master plan has many resiliency elements in it that involves POP/Riverside communities, so we should use the master plan to inform our work. The Boston Region Municipal Planning Organization work involves assessing flooding in the Rt 1A transportation corridor that passes through Revere. He thinks we should reference those parallel planning efforts and be familiar with those recommendations and conclusions. Bob wants all planning efforts/projects to be referenced. ─ Bob brought up the Regional Saugus River Floodgate Project that is potentially being reconsidered by the US Army Corps of Engineers. It could be planned in conjunction with the replacement of the Edwards Bridge, which spans the Saugus River. He wants us to raise that issue with MassDOT. Bob also noted insurance implications: Flood insurance costs are a driver in community participation due to flooding shown in FEMA maps that inform insurance rates. The City noted that FEMA’s 2016 flood maps expanded the V-zone, and mapped some V-zones into the landward side of the line of protection, which brought one home’s annual flood insurance premium to $50,000. Bob also mentioned the new fire station that is being constructed in the Point of Pines, which is important for emergency response efforts in this portion of the city. • Elle responded echoing that point, noting that public safety is affected when the fire station is cut off from the Point of Pines and Riverside population. Also, the growth on Revere Beach Boulevard will benefit from this new permanent station. • James Cullen stated that the Fire Department will have a high-water vehicle (not for 2 years), and that the department is looking forward to having a permanent station in the Point of Pines. The high-water vehicle is being funded through an Urban Area Security Committee grant. • Bob suggested that “Shovel Worthy” projects that could be applicable for infrastructure funding such as pump stations and seawall repairs that could be incorporated into this work. • Elle noted her department has been working with Ed Fortuna to create an evacuation center at the senior center, and took a generator from the Beachmont fire station that will allow the senior center to be used as an evacuation space. The City also purchased a number of flood barriers for the senior center. • Bob suggested that the MWRA’s new water line that is proposed to cross the Saugus River into the Point of Pines should be referenced in the plan. • Elle and Frank noted that the City’s outreach to other stakeholders should include MassDOT, DCR, and the MBTA as they own and/or operate a lot of property in Revere. Also noted important developers. 5.0 Discussion Item #1 – Update of Status of Mitigation Measures • Aaron reviewed the action table, which includes 43 actions that were designated by the City in the 2015 plan. The City initiated an update of the status of these actions during a Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee meeting that was held in February 2020. • Regarding mitigation needs at sites not owned by the City, Anna noted the importance of the action description – so while the City may not own the property (and therefore cannot have the action of implementing a particular project) their action could be to meet with the property owner to make them aware of the problem, the impacts of this problem on the City, and any mitigation measures that the City would like to advocate for (that would ultimately be implemented by the owner). The example Anna used was for the problem of flooding on a State-owned roadway running through a municipality, say from an undersized culvert. The municipality does not have the authority to undertake a hazard mitigation project on a State-owned road. However, since the flood conditions affect the City, their action item could be to reach out to the State and possibly schedule a meeting to discuss the problem, its impacts, and possible solutions that the City would like to see (i.e., for the State to increase the size of the culvert running under the roadway so it no longer floods). • Elle noted that for action item 3, seawall upgrade, they are trying to identify what the best resiliency option is as part of the ongoing coastal resilience feasibility study for the Point of Pines and Riverside area. • New items from the Master Plan that need to be added include Gibson Park updated, North Shore Boatyard at 27 Thayer Avenue (acquire property and then make upgrades to mitigate flooding in neighborhood). 3 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #1 1/20/2021",
        "HMP Planning Committee Meeting #1 Minutes • Elle asked if the list should be categorized by if it is infrastructure, plan, upgrade, equipment? This grouping could help with comprehension of funding sources for each project. • Elle added it may be helpful to identify the location of actions on a map to aide in visualization of risk. • Revere Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee members will review list and update accordingly. 6.0 Discussion Item #2 – Update List of Critical Infrastructure • Aaron talked about the need to update this list to accurately reflect what we are considering critical infrastructure. • Elle asked if the list could be tiered to identify higher and lower priority places. • Anna highlighted the nuances between mitigation and emergency response, this is driven by mitigation and not response. • Aaron agreed and said AECOM will address this in current critical infrastructure list before handing it back to Revere to update. 7.0 Discussion Item #3 - Update on Hazard Mitigation Issues • Anna discussed a table that needs to be updated with recent natural hazard event occurrences that have happened since last update was completed. These are organized by natural hazard, and the City can also identify any actions that are ongoing or possible mitigation strategies. • There was a discussion about extreme weather events and mitigation actions over the last 5-6 years: (Aaron transcribed in a separate table) ─ Frank: Tornado in summer 2014. ─ Joe: High tides and nor’easter in March 2018. ─ Bob: Noted that the biggest issue is when a multitude of issues occur at once. ─ Bob: Stated the City has done beach nourishment to help with erosion. ─ Elle: Implemented a program in the Pearl Avenue area to elevate houses. The City has looked at expanding this program, but some upfront costs would need to be incurred by homeowners prior to receiving grant funds. Noted it is an uphill battle with outreach and City Council. Also noted that FEMA buyout for repetitive loss properties is an option to consider. ─ Frank: Major hazards centralize around flooding due to extreme precipitation and high tides combined with storm events. • The City noted it is interested in purchasing properties along Route 1A for marshland restoration purposes (flood mitigation). • Aaron noted NFIP Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) properties in Revere are on the State radar in terms of areas in need of mitigation. 8.0 Final Talking Points, Comments, or Questions • Elle stated t is important to reference the regional flood gate project in the HMP update. She has shared materials with AECOM. • Elle noted it would be helpful to have a way to record data from 311 calls. This would allow for capturing some basic information about location and hazard impacts that could be used to supplement discussions in the plan of not only areas impacted by hazard but frequency of occurrence, typical impacts, etc. 9.0 Action Items • Elle to coordinate the review and update of the mitigation actions included in the 2015 plan. • Elle to coordinate development of a stakeholder list and initiate outreach activities. • AECOM to progress the list of critical facilities/infrastructure and provide to the City for additional revisions. 4 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #1 1/20/2021",

Desired outcome is that actions in mitigation strategy will be formed by findings of the risk and vulnerability assessment. 2.0 Updated Risk Assessment (Led by Tom Redstone) • Tom Redstone took over presentation and discussed the intent of the risk assessment in hazard mitigation plans, benefits of updating the risk assessment, and the findings of the risk assessment for this update. • Identified following assessments since 2015 Plan: FEMA defined Special Flood Hazard Area was updated in 2017; Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Summary of Findings Report completed in 2019. • Changes to risk and vulnerability assessment since 2015 Plan: natural hazards are assessed through the context of climate change, in alignment with the 2018 State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP). • While not a traditional natural hazard, invasive species have been added to the 2021 Update to be consistent with SHMCAP. Aside from minor modifications (river flooding now classified as inland flooding), no significant changes were made to the hazards profiled. • Tom reviewed the high-level recurrence intervals that were identified for each hazard, necessary to identify probability of occurrence. Elle noted increasing coastal flooding, precipitation, erosion, high temperatures, and extreme weather. These hazards are already grouped as “high” frequency (recurrence interval of less than 10 years). General consensus was that while there are upticks, observed trends still seem to align with what was in the 2015 Plan. Tom indicated that based on this feedback, he’ll keep as-is, but add text to provide context regarding local observations • Tom summarized the findings of the risk analysis and loss estimation, noting that the findings came from FEMA’s National Risk Index (NRI). Tom acknowledged the following benefits of the NRI data: ─ Expands loss estimations from 2015 Plan to include the following hazards: drought, landslides, hurricanes (beyond wind), severe winter storms, and tornadoes. ─ 2015 Plan just estimated damages from flooding, hurricane winds, and earthquakes. • Tom acknowledged the following shortcomings of the NRI data: ─ Demonstrated by value of hazard exposure (built environment) – should be equal for community-wide hazards (extreme temperatures, hurricanes, severe winter storms, tornadoes, and earthquakes). 1 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #2 4/27/2021",
        "HMP Planning Committee Meeting #2 Minutes ─ Census tract data was pulled from a nationwide dataset, and resultantly, required some extrapolation. • Aaron acknowledged limitations of NRI data mentioned that HAZUS would be a good option, but it is not in the scope of this Update. • Elle stated that the City was not prepared to make a decision on whether to include NRI data in the risk assessment at this time. 3.0 Updated Mitigation Goals (Led by Anna Foley) • Anna reviewed goals from the 2015 Plan, informing Committee that mitigation goals are: ─ General guidelines that explain what a community hopes to achieve with a mitigation plan. ─ Broad statements that represent visions for reducing or avoiding future damages and losses. ─ Each action in the mitigation strategy should tie back to one or more goals. • An evaluation or prior goals is required as part of the plan update process. Jurisdictions can either choose to: ─ Keep the previous goals as they were, or ─ Revise them to better reflect current conditions and local priorities. • Anna noted there was a ninth goal in the 2015 plan; however, it was a duplicate and so we removed (Goal #3 and Goal #8 in the prior version both said, “make efficient use of public funds for hazard mitigation”). • During AECOM’s review, the team noticed that the 2015 mitigation strategy did not have any action items falling under the two goals: ─ Education public about zoning/building regulations, particularly with regard to changes in regulations that may affect teardowns and new construction. ─ Encourage future development in areas that are not prone to natural hazards. ─ FEMA reviewers are going to want to see actions to align with goals. Understand that mitigation plans are often robust and that it may not be desirable to add more actions. ▪ One option would be to remove these goals. ▪ Alternatively, the City could opt to keep the goals as is but round out the mitigation strategy to add action items that address Goals 5 and 6. • Regarding #5 – public outreach during the plan maintenance phase (the next 5 years after the update is adopted) is a requirement anyway, so this is just quantifying a topic under an activity that is required • Regarding #6 – The City is presently wrapping up its Capability Assessment, but the in-progress version highlights several areas of improvement, particularly regarding the safe growth audit. • Additionally, the City floodplain manager is probably undertaking some activities on a day-to-day basis that align with both these goals. • Anna asked if there was a general consensus to carry forward the goals from the 2015 Plan? ─ The City concurred. Yes, the 2015 goals will be carried forward. Actions will be added to align with Goals 5 and 6. Anna will craft action item text around the themes presented in her presentation and they will be provided to the City for their review. 4.0 Updated Mitigation Actions (Led by Aaron Weieneth) • Aaron provided a general summary of progress on mitigation actions since the 2015 Plan. ─ A total of 43 actions were included in the 2015 Plan: ▪ 13 actions have been completed. ▪ 9 actions are in progress. ▪ 27 actions were carried forward into the 2021 Update. 2 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #2 4/27/2021",
        "HMP Planning Committee Meeting #2 Minutes • 7 new actions have been identified through the City’s MVP planning process and 14 new actions were identified by Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee and feedback from Stakeholder Meeting #1. • Aaron informed Committee that City needs to identify priority level, implementation responsibility, implementation schedule, and the estimated cost. • Aaron asked the City to keep in mind that high priority actions would be more likely to rise to the top in competitive grant programs. • Local review to follow; City to provide comments back to AECOM by the end of the week as far as finalizing priority levels. • General discussion occurred regarding update of mitigation actions: ─ Don mentioned the City is in process of cleaning ditch – all have to be attended to; cleaned ditch off Ocean Ave, process of permitting Green Creek ditch; permitting process of cleaning Traphony Brook – how the City gets to dewater every 12 hours before low tide, has not gotten that opportunity because ditches are so full of sediment. ─ City emphasized the importance of water and drainage projects to the City. City will continue to seek money from local, state, and federal sources to fund these projects. ─ Don mentioned that projects in Riverside, Point of Pines, and Dunn Road are critical for the City. ─ Elle identified preliminary recommendations for Point of Pines. There is a proposed option for a seawall that retracts and is used when necessary. City is also working towards longer-term interventions, such as putting in a flood wall barrier along Mills Riverside Avenue. There is the issue of needing to come back to tie seawall into a high point, and potential logistical challenges with tie in at Route 1A, otherwise flood waters will still enter City. Underground utilities may be a deal breaker. ─ Nick stated that the proposed plan has trench drains at the beginning of each side street, Catch basins do not always function because they are connected to corrugated pipes that were installed in the 1940’s and 1950’s and have been eroded by seawater. First items the City needs is drainage infrastructure and a pump station to remove unwanted water, followed by a seawall. Need pump station to get water back out if wall is breached. Interior drainage is critical element. City looking into a phased approach. ─ Rob mentioned resiliency measures as part of redevelopment plan. Boston and Revere are working on a joint project at Suffolk Downs. Boston is on the same track regarding the Suffolk Downs development. Rob recommended clarifying that drainage project is in the preliminary planning phases. ─ Including projects at preliminary concept level will increase the opportunity of securing regional grants. ─ Elle acknowledged that with so much development going on, some mitigation measures will be paid for by private developers and some will be public. Even if we just add an appendix of mitigation measures paid for by private developers that will be helpful. 5.0 Next Steps (Led by Aaron Weieneth) • Present timeline shows Draft in mid-May. Given that this committee meeting was pushed back a bit the Draft may, in turn, extend out toward late-May. 6.0 General Discussion / Q&A • None. 7.0 Action Items • City to provide comments back to AECOM by the end of the week as far as finalizing priority levels. • City to determine whether NRI data should be included in risk and vulnerability assessment. • City to send follow up info to Aaron; possible addition of an appendix of mitigation measures being implemented at private developments throughout the City. • AECOM to work to craft a couple of mitigation actions to tie back to mitigation goals that currently lack actions. 3 Revere, MA HMP Committee Meeting #2 4/27/2021",

AECOM was responsible for preparing workshop materials, leading presentations, facilitating large group discussions, and overseeing the small group discussions. The Core Project Team members and additional City staff were responsible for facilitating and note taking during the small group discussion. Workshop Participants Sixty-nine stakeholders representing departments and decisions-makers from the City of Revere, neighborhoods, business associations, and regional and state entities were invited to the workshops. A total of 38 stakeholders attended Workshop 1 on January 10, 2019 (Figure 1). Twenty-eight stakeholders attended Workshop 2 on January 31, 2019. Both workshops were held at the Point of Pines Yacht Club, located at 28 Rice Avenue in Revere. A complete list of invitees and attendees is included in Appendix A. The stakeholders who attended represented several departments of the City of Revere; Revere neighborhood associations, including individuals from Beachmont, West Revere, and Riverside Association; Point of Pines Yacht Club; Point of Pines Beach Association; Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation; and other entities. Figure 1: Participants of Workshop 1 at the Point of Pines Yacht Club Process Workshop 1 Workshop 1 began with welcome and introductions led by Elle Baker, City of Revere, and a presentation by Aaron Weieneth, AECOM. The presentation included an overview of the MVP program and an introduction to climate change projections and natural hazards. After the presentation, AECOM led a group discussion to identify the top hazards in Revere and recorded these hazards on large flip charts. The remainder of the workshop was dedicated to small group activities and a report out to the larger group. AECOM provided instructions for the breakout group activity.

These geographic areas included: • Beachmont • Point of Pines / Riverside • Oak Island / Revere Beach • West / North Revere • Sales Creek During Workshop 1, participants identified the need to expand the Sales Creek area to include Youngs Hill. The geographic area approach was used to help facilitate focused discussions on areas of the City that have historically been affected by natural hazards are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The breakout groups were also instructed to consider portions of the City located beyond their assigned area. Figure 2: Five geographic areas identified in Revere for MVP Workshops AECOM 3",
        "MVP Workshop # 1 and Workshop #2 City of Revere, Massachusetts Each breakout group consisted of four to ten individuals and a facilitator. Several workshop participants were identified as ‘City-wide’ experts and instructed to participate in the small group discussions in all five geographic areas. The first assignment for each group was to identify the top four hazards the city faces. After discussing and evaluating natural hazards, each group recorded their top four hazards in the “Top Priority Hazards” section of the CRB Risk Matrix, a tool developed as part of the CRB framework. All groups were then tasked with identifying infrastructural, societal, and environmental features that would be impacted by the top four hazards. Participants recorded the ownership and identified the location of each feature on base maps (Figure 3) and in the CRB Risk Matrix (Figure 4). Each feature was categorized as a strength (S) or a vulnerability (V). The breakout group facilitator guided the process of identifying and characterizing features. AECOM staff oversaw the small group discussions and provided assistance as needed. After each group had selected four top priority hazards and populated the Features, Location, Ownership, and V or S columns of the CRB Risk Matrix, AECOM staff led a report out session. A spokesperson from each group reviewed the top four hazards and select infrastructure, society, and environmental features for their geographic area. A summary of these features was captured on a large flip chart. Copies of the base maps used in the workshop are included in Appendix B. Completed CRB Risk Matrices for each geographic area/breakout group are included in Appendix C. Refer to Appendix D for the agenda and meeting materials for Workshop 1. Figure 3: Participants map (left) and discuss (right) features in Workshop 1 Workshop 2 Workshop 2 included a brief presentation by Aaron Weieneth, AECOM, to review: • The City’s objectives for the MVP program • Local natural and climate-related hazards of concern identified in Workshop 1 • Existing and future infrastructural, societal, and environmental strengths and vulnerabilities Following this overview, five geographic area breakout groups were reconvened to develop prioritized actions for the City. With the assistance of a designated facilitator, each group reviewed the CRB Risk Matrix that was initiated in Workshop 1. The next step was to brainstorm actions to reduce vulnerability and reinforce strengths for each of the infrastructural, societal, and environmental features identified in Workshop 1. Participants were given examples of potential actions as well as a list of hazard mitigation measures identified during the preparation of Revere’s Hazard Mitigation Plan in 2014. AECOM 4",
        "MVP Workshop # 1 and Workshop #2 City of Revere, Massachusetts Figure 4: Example of a completed CRB Risk Matrix from Sales Creek area participants Several human-caused hazards in Revere were identified during Workshop 1 and documented in the CRB Risk Matrices. While the Core Project Team and other workshop participants recognize that it is important to address these hazards, it was determined that human-caused hazards were out of the scope of this project. The breakout groups were instructed to focus on developing actions for natural and climate-related hazards in Workshop 2. A combined total of 79 actions were developed for Revere. Where appropriate, groups identified which priority hazard(s) each action addressed. The majority of actions addressed flood hazards or multiple hazards. Refer to the CRB Risk Matrices in Appendix D for a complete list of actions. Each breakout group then ranked the priority and identified the timeframe for all proposed actions. Actions were assigned a high (H), medium (M), or low (L) priority based on factors including funding availability, impacts from recent hazards, necessity for advancing longer-term outcomes, contribution towards meeting existing planning objectives, and geographic scope. Participants considered the timeframe to implement actions with respect to factors including need or urgency, feasibility, and cost. Actions were assigned an ongoing (O), short (S), or long (L) timeframe (Figure 4). Each breakout group determined three to five highest priority actions to report out to the large group. The AECOM staff captured these highest priority actions on a flip chart during the report out session, and action commonalities across the breakout groups were identified. For the final step in prioritizing actions, participants were asked to vote on their top five priorities by placing sticky dots next to the actions they considered the highest priorities for the City regardless of the geographic areas (Figure 5).

Community Listening Session Revere hosted a public information and listening session titled “Climate Change & Revere: A Community Listening Session” on April 4, 2019 from 6:30-7:30PM at the Rumney Marsh Academy Auditorium (140 American Legion Highway, Revere, MA). The listening session was advertised on the City’s website, social media, distribution lists, and in the Revere Journal. It was also recorded by RevereTV and posted online. The listening session was kicked off by Mayor Brian Arrigo and provided the public with the opportunity to learn about the MVP workshops and to ask questions and provide feedback about the key findings and top priorities identified during the workshops (Figure 11). Participants also had an opportunity to identify additional issues they are aware of that were not identified in this MVP Summary of Findings Report. Information collected during the listening session is included in Appendix E. Figure 11: Photo of listening session participants 8. Conclusion and Next Steps The priorities identified during the MVP workshops, outlined in this report, and identified during the listening session will be integrated into existing and future municipal planning efforts, including the City’s Master Plan Update, Capital Improvement Plan, and Hazard Mitigation Plan Update. The City will seek funding from the MVP Action Grant Program and other sources to implement the priority actions identified in this report to improve Revere’s resilience to natural hazards and climate change. The City will also submit annual progress reports to the Commonwealth that outline steps taken toward implementing its priority actions to maintain designation as an MVP community. 9.

        "Stakeholder Workshop 1 - Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study Minutes Aaron Weieneth provided an overview of the following six tasks that comprise the MVP Action grant scope of work: • Task 1: Stakeholder Outreach and Engagement • Task 2: Assessment of Current and Future Conditions • Task 3: Identify Short-Term Resilience Measures • Task 4: Develop Coastal Resilience Toolkit • Task 5: Assess Feasibility of Coastal Resilience Options • Task 6: Point of Pines and Riverside Area Coastal Resilience Feasibility Report 4.0 Project Schedule Aaron Weieneth explained that the coastal resilience feasibility study was kicked off in October 2020, and the project performance period extends through June 2021. He presented a detailed schedule that was included in the presentation. 5.0 Potential Collaboration Opportunities • Aaron Weieneth noted that there are several other projects underway in the study area, including: ─ Boatyard project with potential community rowing/boating access ─ Boston Region MPO Route 1A Corridor Vulnerability Assessment ─ DCR Revere Beach Reservation Vulnerability Assessment ─ RiverFront District Master Plan • Aaron Weieneth presented some detail on stormwater and flooding control measures for the RiverFront District Master Plan. He noted the Point of Pines and Riverside Area Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study will take into consideration recommendations that come out of the master planning effort. 6.0 Stakeholder and Project Partner Feedback and Discussion • Elle Baker indicated that the City of Revere submitted an application to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to revisit a study conducted in the 1990s that recommended a regional flood gate across the Saugus River, along with other proposed flood protection measures. The City expects to receive an update from the USACE in late spring/early summer. (Note: Additional detail on the Regional Saugus River Floodgate Project is available online: https://saugusriverfloodgates.com/.) • Bob O’Brien commented that the primary focus of the study is coastal flooding rather than inland flooding, which includes rain events. He thinks that rain events contribute to flooding that the Riverside Area is currently experiencing and asked how the study would account for inland flooding. ─ Aaron Weieneth stated that MC-FRM mapping does not factor in extreme precipitation events, but we will be looking at precipitation data that is available from ResilientMA and other sources. The City does not have its drainage system modeled in this area, but we have anecdotal information and other resources we can draw from. He noted the need to be careful when building berms and seawalls to account for inland drainage. Otherwise the coastal interventions may result in impoundment areas. ─ Brian Stobbie followed up stating they are dependent on one another; you do not want to retain water and have ponding. • Bob O’Brien noted that although the study is looking at Riverside and Point of Pines together, the study should make distinctions between them given the varying coastal conditions. • Steve Miller commented that there is a substantial difference between storm surge and piped infrastructure. Generally speaking, storm surge overwhelms the precipitation factor. Tide gates are used to prevent inland flooding that would otherwise result from coastal waters during high tides/surges. The Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) did a study of piped infrastructure and how it interfaced with projected coastal conditions. Piped infrastructure can conflict with coastal infrastructure such as tide gates because they do not allow inland flooding to escape. • Elaine Hurley lives on River Avenue and stated that her neighborhood floods regularly during king tides and dependent on which way the wind blows. She stated that she believes the Saugus River flood gate is needed to alleviate the backshore flooding along the Pines River. Elaine worked with the steering committee for the USACE study for four years. ─ Elle Baker reiterated that the City wants to revive the regional flood gate project. 2 Revere, MA Stakeholder Workshop #1 12/15/2020",
        "Stakeholder Workshop 1 - Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study Minutes • Bob O’Brien commented on the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) Route 1A vulnerability assessment study, stating that it will be important that whatever results from the Point of Pines/Riverside Area study compliment MPO study. ─ Steve Miller stated that MassDOT engaged the MPO because there is a need for a regional solution for supply chain and general commuting routes that are on the coasts. He is hoping that the MPO study will consider the susceptibility of Route 1A to routine flooding in the future, and what that means to the neighborhoods and cities that Route 1A connects. His focus is on a wider lens than just Revere for how the coast looks in the future. • Bob O’Brien asked if the Saugus River Floodgate project would be among the options considered in the MVP study. ─ Aaron Weieneth stated that although the Floodgate project would be noted in this study, it is a regional project that is outside the scope of the MVP Action grant study. This is not something Revere alone could progress, but it is an important part of a regional solution moving forward. ─ Frank Stringi stated that the Floodgate project is the “save-all” solution for the region. It was authorized in 1992 and was ready for construction, but the Commonwealth’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs stopped it due to concerns about the emphasis on the structural approach. The City is working to get that project back on the front burner and bring it back to life. ─ Bob O’Brien stated that if the Floodgate project becomes part of the recommendation of this study, it can support pushing a regional solution forward and advocating for it on other projects. • Councilor Powers asked how the overtopping by the old boat house in the Riverside area in the near-term could be abated without seawalls? ─ Aaron Weieneth stated that both short-term and long-term solutions will be evaluated as part of the study. A short- term measure could be temporary barriers that are deployable when storms or extreme high tides are forecast. ─ Nick Moulaison stated that Mills Avenue to the Marina needs immediate attention. • Robert O’Brien stated that the existing infrastructure is failing and there is a need to look at what is in place and not functioning. ─ Joe Maglione stated that some storm drain lines/outfalls have been excavated, but sand has since washed back and is now covering them. A special permit is required in order to go onto the beach with equipment. The City sometimes digs out outfalls by hand. A lot of the pipe is corrugated. He commented that there is a lot of study needed in this area. ─ Elle Baker stated that it is important to look at the condition of existing infrastructure as part of the study, and what improvements are needed. • Councilor Powers noted that on Gilbert Avenue, every time there was a storm it used to flood. The City cleaned out the outfall pipes and put flapper valves on some. Councilor Powers asked if flapper valves can be installed on Wadleigh Avenue as well. He believes there is a landing nearby that has an 8- or 10-inch outfall; he also asked if jersey barriers can help. ─ Joe Maglione noted that some of the outfalls in this area have filled in/been clogged with sand. He stated that jersey barriers will not help as part of a temporary solution because the water will flow between/around them; they are not watertight. • Bob O’Brien stated that this study is needed to develop longer lasting solutions that will not be wrecked by the next big storm. • Carolyn Meklenburg expressed enthusiasm and availability to support the MVP project. 7.0 Next Steps • Project Partners meeting scheduled for late January 2021. • Second stakeholder workshop will be conducted in February 2021 to share available findings from Tasks 2, 3, and 4. 3 Revere, MA Stakeholder Workshop #1 12/15/2020",

He noted the purpose of the memo is to review past reports related to the study area and identify coastal resilience case studies to inform the feasibility study. • Greg Robbins from DCR commented that DCR is initiating a climate change vulnerability assessment of Revere Beach, which scheduled to be complete by June 2021. He noted that Jessica Rowcroft is the DCR point of contact for this project. The results might be too late for the Revere study, but he or Jessica can provide updates. • Loretta LeCentra asked if the past studies have been helpful to inform the current study, and if the past recommendations are applicable today. ─ Aaron Weieneth responded the past studies and reports have provided a lot of helpful background information and data that is being used for the current study. Some elements of the previous recommendations might still be applicable, but they would need to be re-evaluated since site conditions, science, and technologies have changed over time. • 3.0 Review of Draft Point of Pines Beach Management Plan • Aaron Weieneth stated the purpose of the plan is to provide the Point of Pines Beach Association and other stakeholders (such as the City of Revere, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and private landowners) with near-term and lower cost actions that can be implemented as longer-term climate resilience interventions are designed, permitted, and constructed. He reviewed the recommended actions that can be implemented as time and budget allow. • John Polcari stated he is interested in conducting a mapping project for the Point of Pines to document changes in the shoreline over time, potentially using a drone. ─ Elle Baker and Frank Stringi noted that the City has aerial photographs of the city that have been taken every five years that could potentially be reviewed for past conditions. ─ Aaron Weieneth responded that the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management conducted a shoreline change project that illustrates how the shoreline has shifted over time, and that the AECOM team is using this as a data source (https://www.mass.gov/service-details/massachusetts-shoreline-change-project). 1 Revere, MA Partners Meeting #2 01/26/2021",
        "Stakeholder Workshop 2 - Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study Minutes RMAT Technical Assistance ─ Bob O’Brien commented that in addition to gradual changes that occur over time, significant impacts to the shoreline can occur due to extreme weather events. • Elle Baker stated she like the recommendation of establishing a record-keeping system. She also liked the recommendation of installing elevated walkways, she but noted this would likely be a higher cost option and could require some permitting. • Steve Miller asked if the City has engaged a coastal engineering firm to evaluate conditions. ─ Elle Baker responded that the POPBA has not worked with such a firm, but coastal engineers were involved with past Army Corps of Engineers studies and design/installation of existing seawalls. ─ Aaron Weieneth clarified that the AECOM team includes coastal engineers who are contributing to the coastal resilience feasibility study, and that they will be involved with presenting study findings and future stakeholder workshops. • Elle Baker noted the Point of Pines Beach Association (POPBA) has already proceeded with installing some sand fences as well as public education signage. She said it would be helpful to update the mapping included in the draft plan to show the existing fencing and have the suggested additional fencing be informed by the placement of the existing fencing. • John Polcari stated that it might be beneficial to extend the sand fencing at the end of the pathways to the beach to help discourage people disturbing the dunes. It would also be helpful to compare the effectiveness of various placements of fencing. • Steve Miller stated that many coastal municipalities have used jetties to help with shoreline erosion issues. ─ Greg Robbins noted that the Point of Pines is a barrier beach, and these types or structures are not allowed for installation. 4.0 Climate Science and Vulnerability Assessment Memo – In Progress • Aaron Weieneth shared initial findings from the climate science and vulnerability assessment memo, noting that more findings will be presented at the next stakeholder workshop. • Steve Miller suggested the source for the Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM) be revised. The current footnote suggests the projections show conditions for year 2020, which was not one of the years of analysis. He also recommended replacing the NOAA sea level rise graphic with the sea level rise values that are used for the MC-FRM. 5.0 Short-Term Resilience Measures Memo – In Progress • Aaron Weieneth provided an overview of the progress to date on the short-term resilience measures memo. 6.0 Project Schedule • Aaron Weieneth stated the team will be wrapping up Task 2 and 3 over the next few weeks and will progress Task 4 Develop Coastal Resilience Toolkit. Will also be preparing for Stakeholder Workshop #2. 7.0 Next Steps • Second stakeholder workshop will be held February 23, 2021 from 6-7PM. The workshop will cover: ─ Findings from Task 2: Assess Current and Future Conditions ─ Findings from Task 3: Identify Short-Term Resilience Measures ─ Findings from Task 4: Develop Coastal Resilience Toolkit ─ Seek input on criteria used to assess feasibility of coastal resilience options • Schedule final partners meeting ─ Week of April 5, 2021 (tentative) • Elle Baker requested that the Partners provide her with their comments on the Draft Past Studies, Case Studies, and Historical Data Memo and Draft Beach Management Plan by February 5, 2021. 2 Revere, MA Partners Meeting #2 01/26/2021",

The meeting was recorded and also broadcast live on RevereTV and streamed on the City’s YouTube channel. • Elle Baker made introductions and opening remarks regarding the importance of the project, before turning things over to Aaron Weieneth. A PDF of the presentation is attached to these notes and provides additional details. • Aaron Weieneth introduced the team and gave attendees an overview of the meeting agenda. He then discussed how the hazard mitigation planning process, and the implementation of the hazard mitigation plan (HMP), can help Revere achieve its goal of becoming more sustainable and resilient. • Aaron started off the presentation talking about natural hazards; they are a part of Revere’s past and future. Damages can have long term consequences and federal funding isn’t always available after a disaster. • The overall objective of a HMP is to make the City more sustainable and resilient in the short/long term. • Hazard mitigation helps achieve that goal by identifying hazards, evaluating risks, developing mitigation actions, and then successfully implementing those actions. • Aaron turned things over to Anna Foley. 2.0 Why is Hazard Mitigation Important? (Anna Foley presented) • Anna noted that most people have been affected by a natural hazard. • The magnitude depends on the intensity of the event, the number of people and structures exposed, and the effectiveness of pre-disaster mitigation actions in protecting people and property. • Hazard mitigation is the key to resiliency. By mitigating at-risk elements of the built environment today, and incorporating mitigation and resiliency concepts into areas of future development, we can reduce the impacts of future natural disaster events. • Typically, when a hazard event occurs, communities go through a cycle of disaster response, recovery, mitigation, and planning for next event. Hazard mitigation breaks the cycle. As communities implement mitigation measures, the hazards they are impacted by create fewer emergency situations for local responders to attend to, and cause less damage in need of costly repairs. The community’s recovery is facilitated by reduced impacts to the economic and 1 Revere, MA Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 03/03/2021",
        "Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 Minutes social fabric of the community, and there is generally less to be done to get the community back to the point where they are sufficiently prepared for future events. • Mitigation works. It reduces exposure, saves money, and protects lives and property. An updated study by the Multi- Hazard Mitigation Council (part of that National of Institute Building Sciences) estimated that federally funded hazard mitigation projects had an overall benefit cost ratio of 6 to 1. Meaning that on average, $6 would be saved for every $1 spent on mitigation projects. This is not true for every project, but it does speak to the overall value of investing in hazard mitigation projects – done properly, they will save far more money than their project cost. • Natural disasters can’t be prevented, but their impacts can be reduced. For example, raising utilities, elevating structures, building protective dunes. 3.0 Mitigation Planning and Plan Updates (Anna Foley presented) • Prior to the passage of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) local communities were considered eligible applicants for federal hazard mitigation project funding streams as long as their State had a hazard mitigation plan in place. With the passage of DMA 2000, the State plan requirement was continued, and a new requirement was added for local communities to also have a hazard mitigation plan in place for eligibility to apply for mitigation project grants. • Local plans can benefit from updated hazard assessments in their State plans. Revere’s plan update will be informed by the 2018 Massachusetts Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan by, among other things, incorporating climate change impacts for various hazards. • Plans must be updated every five years (with reapproval by FEMA, and readoption by the community). • Anna explained how stakeholder input is critical for the success of the HMP. • The HMP requires ongoing commitment at a local level to implement the projects identified in the plan. This involves striking a balance between competing constraints such as staff capabilities, their time, and funding availability. • Benefits of mitigation planning: ─ Eligibility to apply for hazard mitigation project grants ─ Path to resiliency • By updating the plan, the City will maintain its eligibility to apply for grant funding for projects such as road raising, culvert upgrades, minor localized flood reduction projects, generators, bridge retrofits, utility protection. • Regular updates make sure the plan represents present-day conditions in the community and a current understanding of vulnerabilities based on the most current mapping, data, and technical information. Updates also ensure that the plan implementation strategy still accurately represents what the City would like to see and do moving forward. • Initial Revere HMP was adopted in 2005. The first update was in 2015. The second plan update process began in 2020 and will be completed this year, 2021. 4.0 Overview of Current Plan (Anna Foley presented) • The State Plan included four hazards that were deemed to not pose a significant threat and therefore were not included in the plan. Eight hazards were identified as significant hazards and were included. • AECOM then opened the floor for comments from attendees regarding notable hazard occurrences in Revere since 2015. (Open discussion) ─ Bob O’Brien noted flooding on the Pines River area during high tides and storm events. Beach erosion and scouring. Major transportation routes such as Route 1A, Route 107, and the MBTA Blue Line have been flooded, which has isolated parts of the City. ─ Frank Stringi brought up the tornado of 2015 that damaged the center of the City, down Broadway on the Chelsea line, caused damage to store fronts, trees, utilities, etc. People were left homeless, some homes were demolished, and overall the City wasn’t prepared. (Another attendee noted this occurred on July 28, 2014.) No loss of life was recorded for this incident. ─ Another vulnerability the City has is high marsh grass and phragmites. These have and can be sources of brush fires that are close to houses and can become challenging to control in high wind scenarios. The rail lines through the marsh sometimes create sparks which ignite adjacent vegetation. 2 Revere, MA Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 03/03/2021",
        "Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 Minutes ─ Heavy winds cause problems with trees and powerlines, which exacerbate utility companies and emergency response staff. ─ One attendee observed that interior flooding seems to occur in Revere on a monthly basis now; more often than when the plan was last updated. ─ Elle Baker mentioned the Route 1A study conducted by the Boston Region MPO touches upon things such as the phragmites and Route 1A flood mitigation. She also reported that Mills Avenue floods often now at king tides and sometimes even at high tide. ─ Elle noted that the Beachmont area is a high priority as well, but it needs a higher rate of funding than MVP can offer. The HMP update will allow them to apply for more funding through FEMA grant programs. ─ Frank noted the City has ongoing and future stormwater improvement projects to mitigate flooding such as the Eastern County Ditch drainage improvement project; as well as other projects that have been implemented since the plan was last updated. ─ Frank also brought up construction in the flood plain, specifically Suffolk Downs – everything built will be planned with updated resiliency standards. ─ Bob O’Brien touched on the new FEMA flood maps (2016) and what a useful tool this is moving forward for instituting resiliency during the construction phase for new developments. ─ Elle brought up the progressive initiatives that have been in progress. One such initiative is the Saugus River Flood Gate Project. This project has been in the works for decades and involved collaboration between five cities/towns that will protect coastal properties. Objectives of this project include natural flood protection solutions. The towns/cities submitted an application for a feasibility study to Army Corp of Engineers, and also an application for a Regional Watershed Working Group. Progress is being made on many different fronts. ─ Bob O’Brien brought up rising insurance rates in coastal areas. Noted this is a cost of not paying attention to resiliency. Bob recognized a much higher level of community awareness regarding hazard mitigation and resiliency, even in the few years since the plan was last updated. ─ Aaron asked Chief Bright if there are records of past events such as brush fires. Is that something we can follow up on to retrieve documentation of? Chief Bright responded yes. ─ Bob and Elle expressed a desire for wildfires to be moved into a significant hazard. 5.0 Participation Requirements (Anna Foley presented) • Members of the HMP planning team include those who participated in the last update, community leaders, government agency representatives, elected officials, interested citizens, etc. • Anna explained how a wide range of organizational input ensures the mitigation plan is as comprehensive as possible. • Stakeholder engagement is important in providing feedback not only on past events, but also for their thoughts on potential future issues (the so-called “accidents waiting to happen”). Current residents possess the most comprehensive understanding of the City’s vulnerabilities to natural hazards and can provide feedback that can supplement data and information that is maintained online by state and federal agencies. 6.0 Status of the 2021 Plan Update (Aaron Weieneth presented) • So far, the following tasks have been completed or initiated: ─ Updated land use based on MassGIS. ─ Updated mitigation actions included in the 2015 HMP. ─ Initiated update of critical facilities and infrastructure lists. ─ Initiated vulnerability assessment to compare critical facilities against updated hazards. • Aaron presented the timeline of key future activities. Next item on the timeline is the Local HMP Committee Meeting #2 in early April. The HMP update is scheduled to wrap up by the end of June 2021. 3 Revere, MA Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 03/03/2021",
        "Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 Minutes 7.0 Feedback on Strategy and Action Development & Preliminary Actions for 2021 HMP • Aaron reviewed a summary of the 43 mitigation actions included in the 2015 HMP and MVP Community Resilience Building Risk Matrix Summary Table. • Aaron then reviewed some of the new actions that will be included in the 2021 HMP, such as an upgrade of the Point of Pines pump station and pump, increasing the City’s tree canopy, beach nourishment and erosion control, and Ambrose Park drainage improvements. • Bob O’Brien noted he would like to see the mitigation actions listed according to their state of readiness. 8.0 Group Discussion – Suggestions for additional actions? • Elle noted that the new Point of Pines Fire Station is a huge benefit to residents along Revere Beach Boulevard with the additional future 3,500 units. • Bob noted the City is building a new DPW facility and need to think about how new capabilities can be incorporated. • Paul Argenzio said they are trying to make the DPW facility be net zero with its own power source. It will be protected from flooding even though the facility is along the marsh. • Bob suggested that Suffolk Downs, the new DPW facility, and the new Point of Pines Fire Station stand as a testament to the City’s ongoing commitment and dedication to hazard mitigation and resiliency. 4 Revere, MA Public Stakeholder Meeting #1 03/03/2021",
