effort to identify actions that can be taken to reduce the dangers to life and property from natural hazard events. In the communities of the Boston region of Massachusetts, hazard mitigation planning tends to focus most on flooding, the most likely natural hazard to impact these communities. This plan considers how our warming climate will affect natural hazards. Warming temperatures will fuel changing precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and an increasing frequency and intensity of severe storms. The Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 requires all municipalities that wish to be eligible to receive FEMA funding for hazard mitigation grants, to adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan and update this plan in five-year intervals. PLANNING PROCESS Planning for the Hazard Mitigation Plan update was led by the Woburn Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team, composed of staff from a number of different city departments. the team met on March 16, 2021, April 22, 2021, and July 13, 2021, and discussed where the impacts of natural hazards most affect the city, the effects of climate change, goals for addressing these impacts, updates to the City’s existing mitigation measures, and new or revised hazard mitigation measures that would benefit the city. Public participation in this planning process is important for improving awareness of the potential impacts of natural hazards and to build support for the actions the city takes to mitigate them. The City’s Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team hosted two public meetings. The first meeting was held via Zoom on June 3, 2021. The second meeting on July 27, 2021, was held before the Planning Board via Zoom and the draft plan update was posted on the City’s website for public review. Key city stakeholders and neighboring communities were notified and invited to review the draft plan and submit comments. RISK ASSESSMENT The Woburn Hazard Mitigation Plan assesses the potential impacts to the city from flooding, high winds, winter storms, brush fire, geologic hazards, extreme temperatures, drought, and invasive species. For each risk, the assessment identifies the projected impacts of a warming climate. These are shown in the map series in Appendix B. The Woburn Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team identified 166 Critical Facilities. These are also shown on the map series and listed in Table 29, identifying which facilities are located within the mapped hazard zones. Hazards U.S. – Multihazards (HAZUS-MH) is a standardized methodology developed by FEMA that utilizes Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to estimate physical, economic, and social impacts of disasters. The HAZUS-MH analysis for Woburn estimates property damages from Hurricanes of category 2 and 4 ($25 million to $103 million), earthquakes of magnitudes 5 and 7 ($756 million to $6.9 billion), and the 1% and .2% chance of flooding ($31 to $41 million). CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 6 of 114HAZARD MITIGATION GOALS The Woburn Local Multiple Hazard Community Planning Team endorsed the following ten hazard mitigation goals at the April 22, 2021, team meeting. The team added a tenth goal focused on incorporating future climate change projections. 1. Prevent and reduce the loss of life, injury and property damages resulting from all major natural hazards. 2. Identify and seek funding for measures to mitigate or eliminate each known significant flood hazard area. 3. Integrate hazard mitigation planning as an integral factor in all relevant municipal departments, committees, and boards. • Ensure that the Planning Department considers hazard mitigation in its review and permitting of new development. • Review zoning regulations to ensure that the ordinance incorporates all reasonable hazard mitigation provisions. • Ensure that all relevant municipal departments have the resources to continue to enforce codes and regulations related to hazard mitigation. 4. Prevent and reduce the damage to public infrastructure resulting from all hazards. • Begin to assess the vulnerability of municipal buildings and infrastructure to damage from an earthquake. • Maintain existing mitigation infrastructure in good condition. 5. Encourage the business community, major institutions, and non-profits to work with the city to develop, review, and implement the hazard mitigation plan. 6. Work with surrounding communities, state, regional and federal agencies to ensure regional cooperation and solutions for hazards affecting multiple communities. • Continue to participate in the Mystic Region REPC and Region IV A (Board of Health). 7. Ensure that future development meets federal, state, and local standards for preventing and reducing the impacts of natural hazards. 8. Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures that can be undertaken by property-owners. • Provide information on hazard mitigation activities in the languages most frequently spoken in Woburn. 9. Take maximum advantage of resources from FEMA and MEMA to educate City staff and the public about hazard mitigation. 10. Consider the potential impacts of future climate change. Incorporate climate sustainability and resiliency in hazard mitigation planning. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 7 of 114HAZARD MITIGATION STRATEGY The Woburn Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team identified a number of mitigation measures that would serve to reduce the City’s vulnerability to natural hazard events. Overall, the hazard mitigation strategy recognizes that mitigating hazards for Woburn will be an ongoing process as our understanding of natural hazards and the steps that can be taken to mitigate their damages changes over time. Global climate change and a variety of other factors impact the City’s vulnerability in the future, and local officials will need to work together across municipal lines and with state and federal agencies in order to understand and address these changes. The Hazard Mitigation Strategy will be incorporated into the City’s other related plans and policies. PLAN REVIEW & UPDATE PROCESS The process for developing Woburn’s Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update is summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Plan Review and Update Process Section Reviews and Updates The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team placed an emphasis on public participation for the update of the Hazard Mitigation Plan, discussing strategies to enhance participation opportunities at the first Section 3: Public local committee meeting. During plan development, the plan was Participation discussed at two public meetings hosted by the Hazard Mitigation Team and the Planning Board. The plan was also available on the City’s website for public comment. See Public Comments for feedback. MAPC gathered the most recently available climate, hazard and land use data and met with city staff to identify changes in local hazard areas and development trends. City staff reviewed critical infrastructure Section 4: Risk with MAPC staff in order to create an up-to-date list. The Risk Assessment Assessment integrates projected climate impacts. MAPC also used the most recently available version of HAZUS and assessed the potential impacts of flooding using the latest data. The Hazard Mitigation Goals were reviewed and endorsed by the Section 5: Goals Woburn Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team. Section 6: Existing The list of existing mitigation measures was updated to reflect current Mitigation Measures mitigation activities in the city. Mitigation measures from the 2016 plan were reviewed and assessed as to whether they were completed, in progress, or deferred. The Local Sections 7 and 8: Hazard Mitigation Planning Team determined whether to carry forward Hazard Mitigation measures into the 2021 Plan Update or modify or delete them. The Strategy Plan Update's hazard mitigation strategy reflects both new measures and measures carried forward from the 2016 plan. The Local Hazard CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 8 of 114Mitigation Team prioritized all of these measures based on current conditions. This section of the plan was updated with a new on-going plan Section 9: Plan implementation review and five-year update process that will assist the Adoption & City in incorporating hazard mitigation issues into other City planning Maintenance and regulatory review processes and better prepare the City for the next comprehensive plan update. As indicated in Table 34, Woburn made good progress implementing mitigation measures identified in the 2016 Hazard Mitigation Plan. Considerable work has been done to address drainage problems citywide. Three drainage projects were completed, and progress was made to reduce flooding on four additional projects. Progress was also made on stream, culvert and catch basin maintenance. A number of projects that were partially completed or not initiated have been continued into this plan update. The city also did outreach regarding heat risks and evaluated snow loads for some of its buildings. Overall, fifteen mitigation measures from the 2016 plan will be continued in the plan update. Most retain the same priority in this 2021 Update. Moving forward into the next five-year plan implementation period there will be many more opportunities to incorporate hazard mitigation into the City’s decision-making processes. As in the past, the city will document any actions taken within this iteration of the Hazard Mitigation Plan on challenges met and actions successfully adopted as part of the ongoing plan maintenance to be conducted by the Woburn Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team, as described in Section 9 Plan Adoption and Maintenance. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 9 of 114SECTION 2: INTRODUCTION PLANNING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FEDERAL DISASTER MITIGATION ACT The Federal Disaster Mitigation Act, passed in 2000, requires that after November 1, 2004, all municipalities that wish to continue to be eligible to receive FEMA funding for hazard mitigation grants, must adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan and update this plan in five-year intervals. This planning requirement does not affect disaster assistance funding. Federal hazard mitigation planning and grant programs are administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in collaboration with the states. These programs are administered in Massachusetts by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) in partnership with the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). The City of Woburn contracted with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), to assist the City in updating its third local Hazard Mitigation Plan, which was first adopted in 2007 as a multijurisdictional plan and updated as a single municipality plan in 2016. WHAT IS A HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN? Natural hazard mitigation planning is the process of determining how to systematically reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property damage resulting from natural hazards such as floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Hazard mitigation means to permanently reduce or alleviate the losses of life, injuries, and property resulting from natural hazards through long-term strategies. These long-term strategies include planning, policy changes, programs, projects, and other activities. This plan incorporates consideration of future risks due to projections for the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather fueled by a warming planet. PREVIOUS FEDERAL/STATE DISASTERS Since 1991, there have been 24 natural hazard events that triggered federal or state disaster declarations that included Middlesex County. These are listed in Table 2 below. The majority of these events involved flooding, while others were due to hurricanes or nor’easters, and severe winter weather.

COMMUNITY PROFILE The City of Woburn occupies 13.1 miles of the Fells Upland and is a suburban industrial city located along the upper Mystic Valley. Incorporated in 1642, Woburn became an early manufacturing center, tanning leather and making shoes. Production was large enough so that during the King Philip's Wars, town taxes were partially paid in shoes. The smallpox epidemic of 1675 cut deeply into the town's population. The Middlesex Canal from Boston opened in 1803 and the Boston and Lowell Railroad in 1835. Woburn continued to make boots and shoes and in 1855 made $280,000 in footwear, but by 1865 there had been a shift away from manufacturing shoes and toward the production of leather. In that year alone, the tanneries of Woburn shipped $1.7 million of leather and Woburn was at the head of the tanning industry in the country. Immigrants from Ireland and Canada moved to Woburn to take the jobs in the tanneries and in 1884, 26 large tanneries employed 1500 men producing $4.5 million worth of leather. Henry Thayer of Woburn originated chrome tanning, which took the place of bark tanning in 1901. The tan yards clearly supplemented the city's subsistence farming from the earliest settlement times. By 1915 there was some diversification in the city's economy and residents were making ice cream, machine tools, mops, and paper boxes among other things. Woburn developed as an early English town settlement and has a notable early burying ground. Suburban growth began in the mid-19th century and has continued. Completion of Routes 128 and 93 established Woburn as a suburban economic hub. (Narrative based on information provided by the Massachusetts Historic Commission). The city maintains a website at www.woburnma.gov Table 3: Woburn Characteristics Population: 40,228 people • 5.6% are under age 5 • 19.6% are under age 18 • 16.3% are over age 65 • 5.5% of households have no vehicle available • 79.7% of the population is White • 5.9% of the population is Black • 8.8% of the population is Asian • 4.6% of the population is Latinx CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 12 of 114Number of Housing Units = 16,872 • 61.3% are owner-occupied Source: 2019 American Community Survey The City of Woburn has several unique characteristics to keep in mind while planning for natural hazards: • Woburn has been proactive in addressing the impact of climate on natural hazards. The community is certified by the state as a Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness community. • Records from flooding in 2010 highlight that significant flood damage occurred throughout the city, with 100% of disaster flood claims located outside the FEMA 1% chance flood zone. • Woburn is located in the Mystic River watershed. Woburn collaborates with neighboring towns and the Mystic River Watershed Association to reduce stormwater impacts. • Flooding occurs in multiple locations along the Aberjona River. • Drought has negative impacts on trees, vegetation, and waterways. Drought also has economic impacts as the city must rely on more expensive water from the MWRA for part of its water supply. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 13 of 114SECTION 3: PLANNING PROCESS & PUBLIC PARTICIPATION MAPC employs a six-step planning process based on FEMA’s hazard mitigation planning guidance focusing on local needs and priorities but maintaining a regional perspective matched to the scale and nature of natural hazard events and regional climate change. Public participation is a central component of this process, providing critical information about the local occurrence of hazards while also serving as a means to build a base of support for hazard mitigation activities. MAPC supports participation by the general public and other plan stakeholders through two public meetings, posting of the plan to the City’s website, and invitations sent to neighboring communities, city boards and commissions, and other local or regional entities to review the plan and provide comment. PLANNING PROCESS SUMMARY The six-step planning process outlined below is based on the guidance provided by FEMA’s Local Multi-Hazard Mitigation Planning Guidance. Public participation is a central element of this process, which attempts to focus on local problem areas and identify needed mitigation measures based on where gaps occur in the existing mitigation efforts of the municipality. In plan updates, the process described below allows staff to bring the most recent hazard information into the plan, including new hazard occurrence data, changes to a municipality’s existing mitigation measures, and progress made on actions identified in previous plans. Figure 1: Six-Step Planning Process 1. Map the Hazards – MAPC relies on data from a number of different federal, state, and local sources in order to map the areas with the potential to experience natural hazards. This mapping represents a multi-hazard assessment of the municipality and is used as a set of base maps for the remainder of the planning process. A particularly important source CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 14 of 114of information is the knowledge drawn from local municipal staff on where natural hazard impacts have occurred. These maps can be found in Appendix B. 2. Assess the Risks & Potential Damages – Working with local staff, critical facilities, infrastructure, vulnerable populations, and other features are mapped and contrasted with the hazard data from the first step to identify those that might represent particular vulnerabilities to these hazards. Land use data and development trends are also incorporated into this analysis. In addition, MAPC develops estimates of the potential impacts of certain hazard events on the community. MAPC drew on the following resources to complete the plan: • City of Woburn Zoning Ordinances • City of Woburn Community Resilience Building Workshop Summary of Findings 2019 • Woburn Housing Production Plan • Blue Hill Observatory • Boston HIRA • FEMA, Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Norfolk County, MA, 2012 • FEMA, Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazard • FEMA, Local Mitigation Plan Review Guide, October 2011 • Fourth National Climate Assessment, 2018 • Massachusetts Flood Hazard Management Program • Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management Shoreline Change Data • Massachusetts Office of Dam Safety, Inventory of Massachusetts Dams 2018 • Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation Plan, 2013 • Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan, 2018 • Metropolitan Area Planning Council, GIS Lab, Regional Plans and Data • National Weather Service • Nevada Seismological Library • New England Seismic Network, Boston College Weston Observatory, http://aki.bc.edu/index.htm • NOAA National Climatic Data Center, http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ • Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center • Northeast States Emergency Consortium, http://www.nesec.org/ • Tornado History Project • US Census, 2010 and American Community Survey 2017 5-Year Estimates • USGS, National Water Information System, http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis 3. Review Existing Mitigation – Municipalities in the Boston Metropolitan Region have an active history in hazard mitigation as most have adopted flood plain zoning districts, wetlands protection programs, and other measures as well as enforcing the State building code, which has strong provisions related to hazard resistant building requirements. Many communities have started adopting regulations designed to promote climate resilience. All current municipal mitigation measures must be documented. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 15 of 1144. Develop Mitigation Strategies – MAPC works with the local municipal staff to identify new mitigation measures, utilizing information gathered from the hazard identification, vulnerability assessments, and the community’s existing mitigation efforts to determine where additional work is necessary to reduce the potential damages from hazard events. Additional information on the development of hazard mitigation strategies can be found in Section 7. 5. Plan Approval & Adoption – Once a final draft of the plan is complete it is sent to MEMA for the state level review and, following that, to FEMA for approval. Typically, once FEMA has approved the plan the agency issues a conditional approval (Approval Pending Adoption), with the condition being adoption of the plan by the municipality. More information on plan adoption can be found in Section 9 and documentation of plan adoption can be found in Appendix D. 6. Implement & Update the Plan – Implementation is the final and most important part of any planning process. Hazard Mitigation Plans must also be updated on a five-year basis making preparation for the next plan update an important on-going activity. Section 9 includes more detailed information on plan implementation. 2016 PLAN IMPLEMENTATION & MAINTENANCE The 2016 City of Woburn Hazard Mitigation Plan contained a risk assessment of identified hazards for the city and mitigation measures to address the risk and vulnerability from these hazards. Since approval of the plan by FEMA and local adoption progress has been made on implementation of the measures. The city has advanced a number of projects for implementation, including multiple drainage projects. In addition, the city completed a climate resilience planning program and has been certified by the state in the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness program. THE LOCAL MULTIPLE HAZARD COMMUNITY PLANNING TEAM MAPC worked with the local community representatives to organize a Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team for Woburn. MAPC briefed the local representatives as to the desired composition of that team as well as the need for public participation in the local planning process. The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team is central to the planning process as it is the primary body tasked with developing a mitigation strategy for the community. The local team was tasked with working with MAPC to set plan goals, provide information on the hazards that impact the city, existing mitigation measures, and helping to develop new mitigation measures for this plan update. The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team membership is listed below. Tina Cassidy Planning Board Director, Project Manager Jay Duran Superintendent of Public Works John E. Corey, Jr. City Engineer Len Burnham Deputy Superintendent of Public Works Robert Rufo Police Chief CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 16 of 114Therese Murray Conservation Administrator Thomas Quinn Building Commissioner Donald Kenton Fire Chief Melissa Cushing Resident The Woburn Planning Board and Conservation Commission are the primary entities responsible for regulating development in city. Feedback was assured through the participation of the Conservation Administrator and Planning Board Director. In addition, MAPC, the State-designated regional planning authority for Woburn, works with all agencies that that regulate development in the region, including the listed municipal entities and state agencies, such as the Department of Transportation. The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team met on the following dates: March 16, 2021, April 22, 2021, and July 13, 2021. The purpose of the meetings was to introduce the Hazard Mitigation planning program, consider climate impacts, review, and update hazard mitigation goals, and to gather information on local hazard mitigation issues and sites or areas related to these. Later meetings focused on verifying information gathered by MAPC staff and discussion of existing mitigation practices, the status of mitigation measures identified in the 2016 hazard mitigation plan, and potential new or revised mitigation measures. The agendas for these meetings are included in Appendix A. PUBLIC MEETINGS Public participation in the hazard mitigation planning process is important, both for plan development and for later implementation of the plan. Residents, business owners, and other community members are an excellent source for information on the historic and potential impacts of natural hazard events and particular vulnerabilities the community may face from these hazards. Their participation in this planning process also builds understanding of the concept of hazard mitigation and climate impacts, potentially creating support for mitigation actions taken in the future to implement the plan. To gather this information and educate residents on hazard mitigation, the city hosted two public meetings, one during the planning process and one after a complete draft plan was available for review. The public had an opportunity to provide input to the Woburn hazard mitigation planning process during a public meeting held on June 3, 2021 and hosted on Zoom. The draft plan update was presented at a Planning Board meeting held on July 27, 2021 and hosted on Zoom. Both meetings were publicized in accordance with the Massachusetts Public Meeting Law. The attendance list for each meeting can be found in Table 4. See public meeting notices in Appendix C. Table 4: Woburn Public Meetings Meeting #1 June 3, 2021 (virtual) Total Attendance: 9 CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 17 of 114Meeting #2 July 27, 2021 Total Attendance: 15 LOCAL STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT The local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team reached out to local stakeholders that might have an interest in the Hazard Mitigation Plan including neighboring communities, agencies, businesses, nonprofits, and other interested parties. Notice was sent to the following organizations and neighboring municipalities inviting them to review the Hazard Mitigation Plan and submit comments to the city. In addition, meetings were advertised in the local press, on the city website, and through City social media platforms. Town of Winchester Edens Town of Stoneham Leggat McCall Properties Town of Burlington Robert D. Murray Associates Town of Wilmington Woburn Housing Authority Town of Reading Woburn Residents Environmental Network Mystic River Watershed Association Woburn Chamber of Commerce Woburn Social Capital Murtha Cullina Attorneys Woburn Council of Social Concern Riemer Law Attorney Mark Salvati Cummings Properties See Appendix C for public meeting notices. The draft Woburn Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update was posted on the City’s website for the second public meeting. Members of the public could access the draft document and submit comments or questions to the city. PUBLIC COMMENT At the first public meeting a commenter provided mapping and photos of specific flooding areas of concern. These include Olympia Avenue, Washington Street, and Henshaw Avenue near the I- 93 exchange. In each location flooding is associated with the Aberjona River. Another commenter expressed support for strategies that would establish residential water use restrictions to address drought concerns. Another commenter expressed interest in strategies that would support residents who may be more impacted by, or vulnerable to, natural hazards. After the second meeting a commenter expressed appreciation for inclusion of flooding areas identified in the first public meeting, and reiterated concern about Olympia Avenue and Henshaw Street flooding. These locations have been added to Table 8: Locally Identified Areas of Flooding and to the maps in Appendix B. CONTINUING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION Following the adoption of the plan update, the planning team will continue to provide residents, businesses, and other stakeholders the opportunity to learn about the hazard mitigation planning process and to contribute information that will update the city’s understanding of local hazards. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 18 of 114As updates and a review of the plan are conducted by the Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team, these will be placed on the City’s web site, and any meetings of the Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team will be publicly noticed in accordance with city and state open meeting laws.

This section also includes a vulnerability assessment that estimates the potential damages that could result from certain large-scale natural hazard events. In order to update Woburn’s risk assessment, MAPC gathered the most recently available hazard and land use data and met with City staff to identify changes in local hazard areas and development trends. MAPC also used FEMA’s damage estimation software, HAZUS. With the adoption of the Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan 2018 (SHMCAP), Massachusetts became the first state to integrate climate projections in a state hazard mitigation plan. Following the state model, the projected impacts of our warming climate on natural hazards are integrated throughout the risk assessment. Key impacts include rising temperatures, which in turn affect precipitation patterns, sea level, and extreme weather. “Global climate is changing rapidly compared to the pace of natural variations in climate that have occurred throughout Earth’s history. Global average temperature has increased by about 1.8°F from 1901 to 2016, and observational evidence does not support any credible natural explanations for this amount of warming; instead, the evidence consistently points to human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse or heat-trapping gases, as the dominant cause.” Fourth National Climate Assessment, 2018 (Chapter 2-1) CLIMATE CHANGE OBSERVATIONS AND PROJECTIONS Climate change observations come from a variety of data sources that have measured and recorded changes in recent decades and centuries. Climate change projections, however, predict future climate impacts and, by their nature, cannot be observed or measured. As a result of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future conditions, climate projections are generally expressed as a range of possible impacts. Temperature Our climate has always been regulated by gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, that blanket the earth. These gases trap heat that would otherwise be reflected out to space; without them our planet would be too cold to support life. We refer to these gases as “greenhouse gases” (GHGs) for their heat trapping capacity. The combustion of fossil fuels, our primary energy source in the age of industrialization, releases GHGs into the atmosphere. In the past century, human activity associated with industrialization has contributed to a growing concentration of GHGs in our atmosphere. Records from the Blue Hill Observatory in Milton, MA show that average temperatures (30-year mean) have risen approximately 3 degrees (F) in the almost 200 years since record keeping began in 1831. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 20 of 114Figure 2: Observed Increase in Temperature Climate projections include an increase in average temperature and in the number of extreme heat days. Extreme cold day are projected to decrease in number. The Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (NECASC) projects average temperatures in Massachusetts will increase by 5 degrees F by mid-century and nearly 7 degrees F by the end of the century. Figure 3 shows the NECASC range of projections for increases in the number of days over 90 degrees annually. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 21 of 114Figure 3: Projected Increase in Annual Days Over 90 Degrees F Source: Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center Precipitation Patterns Annual precipitation in Massachusetts has increased by approximately 10% in the fifty-year period from 1960 to 2010 (MA Climate Adaptation Report, 2011). Moreover, there has been a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of large rain events. For the Northeast US, according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment 2018, in the past sixty years there has been a 55% increase in the amount of annual precipitation that falls in the top 1% of storm events (Figure 4). Changes in precipitation are fueled by warming temperatures which increase evaporation and, therefore, the amount of water vapor in the air. Total annual precipitation in Massachusetts is projected to increase by 1 to 6 inches by mid- century, and by 1.2 to 7.3 inches by the end of this century (SHMCAP p. 2-22). The Fourth National Climate Assessment predicts that the pattern of increasing frequency and intensity of extreme rain events will continue. By 2070 to 2099, (relative to 1986 to 2015) they project a 30-40% increase in total annual precipitation falling in the heaviest 1% of rain events (Figure 5).

Despite overall increasing precipitation, more frequent and significant summer droughts are also a projected consequence of climate change. This is due to projections that precipitation will increase in winter and spring and decrease slightly in the summer and, a result of earlier snow melt, and higher temperatures that will reduce soil moisture.

Warming temperatures contribute to sea level rise in two ways. First, warm water expands to take up more space. Second, rising temperatures are melting land-based ice which enters the oceans as melt water. A third, quite minor, contributor to sea level rise in New England is not related to climate change. New England is still experiencing a small amount of land subsidence (drop in elevation) in response to the last glacial period. Figure 6: Observed Increase in Sea Level Rise Source: NOAA CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 24 of 114Projections of sea level rise through 2100 vary significantly depending on future greenhouse gas emissions and melting of land-based glaciers. Currently sea level is rising at an increasing rate. Figure 7 shows the recent rate of sea level rise, and a range of sea level rise scenarios. Projections for 2100 range from 4 feet to 10 feet. With ten feet representing the most extreme scenario. For 2050, the projections range approximately 1.5 to 3 feet. Figure 7: Recent and Projected Increase in Sea Level Rise Source: SHMCAP Following the outline of the Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP), this local hazard mitigation plan organizes consideration of natural hazards based on their relationship to projected climate changes. Table 5 below, from the SHMCAP, summarizes the natural hazards reviewed in this plan, climate interactions, and expected impacts. Ice Jams are an unlikely natural hazard; with no know record of occurrence in Woburn. Woburn has chosen not to profile ice jams since they are a secondary hazard. Finally, since Woburn is an inland community, it is not vulnerable to Tsunamis, Coastal Flooding, and Coastal Erosion; hazards related to coastal areas are not addressed.

Northeasters can occur at any time of the year, but they are most common in winter. Hurricanes are most common in the summer and early fall. Large rain storms can occur year-round. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time due to increasing extreme rainfall events. Increase in average annual rainfall may also lead to more incidents of basement flooding caused by high seasonal groundwater levels. Flooding was the most prevalent serious natural hazard identified by local officials in Woburn. Inland flooding can be associated with overflowing rivers and streams, stormwater flooding associated with impervious surfaces and stormwater infrastructure, and in more rare cases ice jams, ground failures (erosion), and in some communities beaver dams. Woburn is subject to two kinds of flooding: inland/riverine flooding where the rate of precipitation and/or amount of stormwater runoff overwhelms the capacity of natural or structured drainage systems causing overflow and urban flooding in which precipitation causes the water table to rise and leads to flooding of low-lying areas such as streets and underpasses. These types of flooding are often combined as storm events lead to large amounts of draining stormwater. Woburn is located in the Mystic River Watershed. The watershed partially or wholly encompasses 22 communities north and west of Boston. Its headwaters begin in Reading and form the Aberjona River which flows through Woburn and Winchester and into the upper Mystic Lake. From the lower Mystic Lake, the Mystic River flows through Arlington, Somerville, Medford, Everett, Chelsea, Charlestown, and East Boston before discharging to Boston Harbor. The March 2010 rainstorms fit the profile of a type of event expected to increase in frequency as the climate warms. That is, significant precipitation, falling in late winter as rain rather than snow, on ground saturated with snow melt, and while vegetation is still dormant. The Blue Hill Observatory in Milton recorded 17.7 inches of rain from three storms in the 19 days from March 13 to 31. As shown at the USGS gage located on the Aberjona River downstream from Horn Pond in Winchester the river surged, recording the third highest discharge on March 15, 2010, dating back to 1940 (Figure 8). The March 2010 storms were a federally declared disaster making federal assistance available to residents who did not carry flood insurance. Based on the claims, Woburn experienced extensive flood damage, with eight flood insurance claims and 390 disaster claims, 99% of which were located outside of FEMA Special Flood Hazard Areas. Some of the claims are in the vicinity of Woburn’s streams and wetlands, but many are not associated with waterways or wetlands. This is not unusual in urbanized areas. See Map 3 in Appendix B for claim locations. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 28 of 114Figure 8: March 2010 USGS Aberjona River Gage Local data for previous flooding occurrences are not collected by the City of Woburn. The best available local data is for Middlesex County through the National Climatic Data Center. Middlesex County, which includes the City of Woburn, experienced 48 flood events from 2010 through 2020. No deaths or injuries were reported and the total reported property damage in the county was $36.5 million dollars. Nearly all of the damage is attributed to the events in March 2010. This is an average of 4.4 flood events each year. Measures of flooding severity include river forecasts of minor, moderate, or severe flooding.

Flooding may also occur when ice jams break up and ice may pile up at culverts or around bridges. There is no known history of ice jams leading to flooding in Woburn and City staff did not identify this hazard as an issue for the city. DAM FAILURE OR OVERTOPPING Dams can fail because of structural problems or age, independent of any storm event. Earthquakes can be a cause of dam failure by causing structural damage. Dams can also fail structurally because of flooding arising from a storm, or they can overspill due to flooding. In the event of a dam failure, the energy of the water stored behind even a small dam can cause loss of life and property damage if there are people or buildings downstream. The number of fatalities from a dam failure depends on the amount of warning provided to the population and the number of people in the path of the dam’s floodwaters. A concern for dams in Massachusetts is that many were built in the 19th century without the benefits of modern engineering or construction oversight. In addition, some dams have not been properly maintained. The increasing intensity of precipitation is the primary climate concern related to dams, as they were most likely designed based on historic weather patterns. The SHMCAP indicates that changing precipitation patterns may increase the likelihood of overflow events. Dam failure is a highly infrequent occurrence, but a severe incident could result in loss of lives and significant property damage. According to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, three dams have failed in Massachusetts since 1984, one of which resulted in a death. Horn Pond Dam (aka Scalley Dam): Horn Pond covers approximately 120 acres and has a watershed area of 10 square miles. The primary outlet control structure is controlled by a weir and a slide gate with a secondary emergency riprap spillway that handles elevated water levels. The spillway is located on the southerly side of Horn Pond and enters Horn Pond Brook which flows through the Town of Winchester. In severe weather events and in anticipation of a rainfall of 4 inches or greater, the city notifies the downstream cities and towns that they will be lowering the pond to increase storm water runoff storage. When the capacity exceeds the storage volume, the pond begins to crest at elevation 42.0 (NGVD29) thus creating flooding of the local roadway and impacting the residences and apartments that directly abut Horn Pond Brook. Since the 2016 plan, the outlet structure has been modified to improve the ability to manage flood events. Horn Pond Dam is classified by the State Office of Dam Safety as being a significant hazard dam. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 31 of 114DCR Dam Hazard Classification High: Dams located where failure or mis-operation will likely cause loss of life and serious damage to homes(s), industrial or commercial facilities, important public utilities, main highways(s) or railroad(s). Significant: Dams located where failure or mis-operation may cause loss of life and damage home(s), industrial or commercial facilities, secondary highway(s) or railroad(s) Low: Dams located where failure or mis-operation may cause minimal property damage to others. Loss of life is not expected. LOCALLY IDENTIFIED AREAS OF INLAND FLOODING Information on potential flood hazard areas was taken from two sources. The first is the National Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM). The FIRM flood zones are shown on Map 3 in Appendix B. The “Locally Identified Areas of Flooding” described below were identified by City staff as areas where flooding is known to occur. These areas do not necessarily coincide with the flood zones on the FIRMs. Flood sources include inadequate drainage systems, high groundwater, or other local conditions that may not be within a Special Flood Hazard Area. The numbers correspond to the numbers on Map 8, “Local Hazard Areas.” Table 8: Locally Identified Areas of Flooding Map Name Description ID Lake Terrace and Lake Circle – Flooding in this area affects both the Lake Terrace roadway and homes in the area. Flooding is caused by an 1 and Circle inadequate drainage system.

Salem St. at This area was identified as an area where emergency access could 11 Aberjona Dr. be blocked during flood events. Prospect St. Flooding due to drainage issues occurs at the intersection and up to 13 and Jefferson Garfield Street and along the wetlands area between Auburn Avenue Avenue and Hanson Court. 14 New Boston St. Flooding from Halls Brook impacts the roadway. Flooding occurs in the Olympia Avenue in the vicinity of the Aberjona 15 Olympia Rd. River. Flooding here is difficult to address because drainage systems are located on land not controlled by the City. 16 Henshaw St. Flooding in this vicinity is associated with the Aberjona River. REPETITIVE LOSS STRUCTURES As defined by FEMA, a repetitive loss property is a NFIP-insured structure that has had two or more paid flood losses of $1,000 or more in any given 10-year period since 1978. There are 7 repetitive loss properties in Woburn. The properties are shown on the maps in Appendix A. These repetitive loss properties had a total of 17 losses from 1978 to 2020, totaling $634,454 in paid claims. For more information on repetitive losses see https://www.fema.gov/txt/rebuild/repetitive_loss_faqs.txt and https://www.fema.gov/repetitive-flood-claims-grant-program-fact-sheet.

Drought is a period characterized by long durations of below normal precipitation. Drought conditions occur in virtually all climatic zones, yet its characteristics vary significantly from one region to another since it is relative to the normal precipitation in that region. Drought can affect agriculture, water supply, aquatic ecology, wildlife, and plant life. Droughts are projected to increase in frequency and intensity in the summer and fall as weather patterns change. Factors contributing to this include increasing evaporation as a result of warmer weather, earlier snow melt, and more extreme weather patterns. Drought impacts can include reduced groundwater and surface water levels, affecting water quality and quantity, and the organisms that rely on aquatic resources. Drought also increases stress on plant communities and, the likelihood of forest and brush fires. Communities may be affected by water use restrictions, affecting drinking water supply and outdoor water use. Economic sectors impacted could include recreation, agriculture, and forestry. Five levels of drought have been developed to characterize drought severity: Normal, Advisory, Watch, Warning, and Emergency. These drought levels are based on the conditions of natural resources and are intended to provide information on the current status of water resources. The levels provide a basic framework from which to take actions to assess, communicate, and respond to drought conditions. Woburn does not collect data relative to drought events. Because drought tends to be a regional natural hazard, this plan references state data as the best available data for drought. Drought is a city-wide hazard in Woburn. The SHMCAP using data collected since 1850, calculates that statewide there is a 1% chance of being in a drought emergency in any given month. For drought warning and watch levels, the chance is 2% and 8% respectively in any given month (Table 10). Table 10: Frequency of Massachusetts Drought Levels Probability of Occurrence in a Drought Level Frequency Since 1850 Given Month Drought Emergency 5 occurrences 1% chance Drought Warning 5 occurrences 2% chance Drought Watch 46 occurrences 8% chance Source: SHMCAP Drought emergencies have been reached infrequently, with five events occurring between 1850 and 2012: 1883, 1911, 1941, 1957, and 1965 to 1966. Due to its long duration, the drought from 1965 to 1966 is viewed as the most severe drought to have occurred in Massachusetts in modern times. The drought that extended from July 2016 to April 2017 reached the Drought Warning level. Determinations regarding the end of a drought or reduction of the drought level CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 34 of 114focus on two key drought indicators: precipitation and groundwater levels. These two factors have the greatest long-term impact on stream flow, water supply, reservoir levels, soil moisture, and the potential for forest fires. The U.S. Drought Monitor characterizes droughts as moderate, severe, extreme, or exceptional. Severe drought is characterized by likely crop and pasture losses, water shortages, and water restrictions. As shown in Figure 9 below, Woburn experienced between 37 and 49 weeks of severe drought between 2001 and 2017. A concern for Woburn is the impact of drought on Woburn’s water supply. In addition to impacting natural resources, drought causes Woburn to rely on the Metropolitan Water Resources Authority, a more expensive source, to augment city water supply. Figure 9: Weeks of Severe Drought (2001-2017) Source: SHMCAP LANDSLIDES According to the U.S. Geological Survey, “The term landslide includes a wide range of ground movement, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes, and shallow debris flows. Although gravity acting on an over steepened slope is the primary reason for a landslide, there are other contributing factors.” Among the contributing factors are, erosion by rivers or ocean waves over steepened slopes; rock and soil slopes weakened through saturation by snowmelt or heavy rains; earthquake created stresses that make weak slopes fail; excess weight from accumulation of rain or snow; and stockpiling of rock or ore from waste piles or man-made structures. In Massachusetts, according to the SHMCAP, the most common cause of landslides are geologic conditions combined CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 35 of 114with steep slopes and/or heavy rains. Landslides associated with heavy rains typically occur on steep slopes with permeable soils underlain by till or bedrock. Landslides can result from human activities that destabilize an area or can occur as a secondary impact from another natural hazard, such as flooding. In addition to structural damage to buildings and the blockage of transportation corridors, landslides can lead to sedimentation of water bodies. Typically, a landslide occurs when the condition of a slope changes from stable to unstable. Natural precipitation such as heavy snow accumulation, torrential rain, and run-off may saturate soil, creating instability enough to contribute to a landslide. More frequent extreme rain events may increase the chance of landslides as saturated soils are conducive to landslides. Drought may also increase the likelihood of landslides if loss of vegetation decreases soil stability. The SHMCAP, utilizing data from the MA Department of Transportation from 1986 to 2006 to estimates that, on average, roughly one to three known landslides have occurred each year. A slope stability map published by the MA Geological Survey and UMass-Amherst indicates that the most significant risk of landslide is in western Massachusetts. According to the SHMCAP, factors that influence landslide severity include soil properties, topographic position and slope, and historical incidence. Woburn is classified as having low susceptibility and a low incidence of landslides (see Map 4, Appendix B). Should a landslide occur in the future, the type and degree of impacts would be highly localized. The city’s vulnerabilities could include damage to structures, damage to transportation and other infrastructure, and localized road closures. Injuries and casualties, while possible, would be unlikely given the low extent and impact of landslides in Woburn. The Building Inspector reports that there have been three small landslides in the last decade. Each was associated with former quarries and caused minor damage on private property. RISING TEMPERATURES AVERAGE AND EXTREME TEMPERATURES Extreme temperatures occur when either high temperature or low temperatures relative to average local temperatures occur. These can occur for brief periods of time and be acute, or they can occur over long periods of time where there is a long stretch of excessively hot or cold weather. Woburn has four well-defined seasons. The seasons have several defining factors, with temperature one of the most significant. Extreme temperatures can be defined as those that are far outside of the normal seasonal ranges for Massachusetts. EXTREME COLD The severity of extreme cold temperature is typically measured using the Wind Chill Temperature Index, which is provided by the National Weather Service (NWS). The wind chill is the apparent temperature felt on exposed skin due to the combination of air temperature and wind speed. The index is provided in Figure 11 below. A Wind Chill warning is issued when the Wind Chill Index is forecast to fall below -25 degrees F for at least 3 hours. Extreme cold is a dangerous situation CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 36 of 114that can result in health emergencies for susceptible people, such as those without shelter, those who are stranded, or those who live in homes that are poorly insulated or without heat. Figure 10 Wind Chill Temperature Index and Frostbite Risk Source: National Weather Service The City of Woburn does not collect data for previous occurrences of extreme cold. The best available local data are for Middlesex County, through the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). There have been three extreme cold events in the past eleven years, which caused no deaths, no injuries, or property damage. This is an average of one event every 3.5 years. Extreme cold is a city-wide hazard for Woburn. Table 11: Middlesex County Extreme Cold and Winch Chill Occurrences 2011 through 2020 Date Deaths Injuries Damages 2/14/2015 0 0 0 2/15/2016 0 0 0 2/16/2016 0 0 0 Source: NOAA, National Climatic Data Center EXTREME HEAT A heat wave in Massachusetts is defined as three or more consecutive days above 90°F. Another measure used for identifying extreme heat events relies on the Heat Index. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the Heat Index is a measure of how hot it really feels relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature. The NWS issues an advisory when the heat CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 37 of 114index (Figure 12) is forecast to exceed 100°F for two or more hours; an excessive heat advisory is issued if the forecast predicts the temperature will rise above 105°F. Figure 11: Heat Index Chart The City of Woburn does not collect data on excessive heat occurrences. The best available local data are for Middlesex County, through the National Climatic Data Center. In the past eleven years there has been one excessive heat day and no deaths, injuries, or property damage (see Table 12). This is an average of one extreme heat occurrence every 11 years. Table 12: Middlesex County Extreme Heat Occurrences 2010 through 2020 Date Deaths Injuries Damage 7/6/2010 0 0 0 Source: NOAA, National Climatic Data Center Extreme cold events are predicted to decrease in the future, while extreme heat days, as well as average temperatures are projected to increase. The projected increase in extreme heat and heat waves is the source of one of the key health concerns related to climate change. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can cause heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and death. Heat exhaustion is the most common heat-related illness and if untreated, it may progress to heat stroke. People who perform manual labor, particularly those who work outdoors, are at increased risk for heat-related illnesses. Prolonged heat exposure and the poor air quality and high humidity that often accompany heat waves can also exacerbate pre-existing conditions, including respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease, and mental illnesses. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 38 of 114Older adults are often at elevated risk due to a high prevalence of pre-existing and chronic conditions. People who live in older housing stock and in housing without air conditioning have increased vulnerability to heat-related illnesses. Power failures are more likely to occur during heat waves, affecting the ability of residents to remain cool during extreme heat. Individuals with pre-existing conditions and those who require electric medical equipment may be at increased risk during a power outage. Due to what is termed the “heat island effect”, areas with less shade and more dark surfaces (pavement and roofs) will experience even hotter temperatures; these surfaces absorb heat during the day and release it in the evening, keeping nighttime temperatures warmer as well. Map 10 in Appendix B displays areas that are among the hottest 5% of land in the MAPC region based on land surface temperature derived from satellite imagery on July 13, 2016, when the high temperature at Logan Airport was 92°F. There are areas of Woburn that have significant heat islands including west of Route 93 and along Main Street (see Map 9). It is also worth noting that heat impacts are more likely to be felt by residents without air conditioning, by those who work outdoors, and those with underlying health conditions. Average temperatures in Massachusetts are projected to increase by 3.8 to 10.8 degrees by the end of the century (SHMCAP). Over time our climate will become more similar to areas south of New England. Impacts on natural resources include a longer growing season and northern migration of plants and animals, including invasive species. The SHMCAP identifies ecosystems that are expected to be particularly vulnerable to warming temperatures. These include coldwater fisheries, vernal pools, spruce-fir forests, northern hardwood forests (Maple, Beach, Birch), Hemlock forests, and urban forests (due to heat island impacts). WILDFIRE A wildfire is a non-structure fire occurring in a forested, shrub or grassland areas. In the Boston Metro region these fires rarely grow to the size of a wildfire, as seen more typically in the western U.S. A more likely occurrence is brush fires that typically burn no more than the underbrush of a forested area. There are three different classes of wildfires: • Surface fires are the most common type and burn along the floor of a forest, moving slowly and killing or damaging trees. • Ground fires are usually started by lightning and burn on or below the forest floor. • Crown fires spread rapidly by wind, jumping along the tops of trees. A wildfire differs greatly from other fires by its extensive size, the speed at which it can spread out from its original source, its potential to unexpectedly change direction, and its ability to jump gaps such as roads, rivers, and fire breaks. Wildfire season can begin in March and usually ends in late November. The majority of wildfires typically occur in April and May, when most vegetation is void of any appreciable moisture, making them highly flammable. Once \"green-up\" takes place in late May to early June, the fire danger usually is reduced somewhat. As the CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 39 of 114climate warms, drought and warmer temperatures may increase the risk of wildfire as vegetation dries out and becomes more flammable. The National Wildfire Coordinating Group classifies the severity of wildfires based on their acreage. Fires can present a hazard where there is the potential to spread into developed or inhabited areas, particularly residential areas where sufficient fuel materials might exist to allow the fire the spread into homes. Protecting structures from fire poses special problems and can stretch firefighting resources to the limit. If heavy rains follow a fire, other natural disasters can occur, including landslides, mudflows, and floods. If the wild fire destroys the ground cover, then erosion becomes one of several potential problems. POTENTIAL BRUSHFIRE HAZARD AREAS The SCHMCAP includes a graphic that depicts statewide fire risk incorporating three risk components: fuel, wildland-urban interface, and topography (Figure 12). The wildland-urban interface reflects communities where housing and vegetation intermingle, and fire can spread from structures to vegetated areas. The most susceptible fuels are pitch pine, scrub oak and oak forests. Topography can affect the behavior of fires, as fire spreads more easily uphill. Woburn is shown in the no risk zone. Fire was not identified as a common occurrence, but one additional area of concern along railroad tracks was identified. The most common cause of wildfires is the careless disposal of smoking materials and untended campfires. The following areas of city were identified as having the highest potential for brush fires. The numbers correspond to the numbers on Map 8, “Hazard Areas”: Table 13: Locally Identified Areas of Brushfire Risk Map Name Description ID On the westerly side of Horn Pond and north of the Woburn Country Club golf course is an area where Adjacent to Horn numerous fires have occurred over the years. With many 10 Pond walking trails bisecting the area, fire hazards such as the carelessness with cigarettes and children playing with matches are of great concern. Adjacent to Cabot Road and along the railroad tracks 12 Cabot Road there is the potential for brushfires. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 40 of 114Figure 12: Wildfire Risk Areas Source: SHMCAP While there are areas of fire risk, city officials indicate that significant brush fires are not a common occurrence. INVASIVE SPECIES The 2018 SHMCAP includes invasive species as a natural hazard for the first time. They are defined as “non-native species that cause or are likely to cause harm to ecosystems, economies, and/or public health”. In new habitats invasive species displace native species if they have competitive advantages including that they are not subject to biological controls from their native habitat. Some of the more recognizable invasive plant species noted in the SHMCAP include Norway maple, garlic mustard, Japanese barberry, black swallowwort, buckthorn, purple loosestrife, water milfoil, Japanese knotweed, and phragmites. Invasive pests include gypsy moth, hemlock wooly adelgid, and the Asian long-horned beetle. Green crabs are a notable marine invasive. The Massachusetts Invasive Plant Advisory Group categorizes invasive severity as either limited prevalence in Massachusetts, partial containment potential, or public health threat. The City of Woburn is concerned with the presence of exotic and invasive species since they degrade natural vegetation and habitat and threaten native biodiversity. The presence of invasive species may cause a reduction in both plant and animal (wildlife) diversity. Natural vegetation can get choked out and this in turn causes a decline in the types and abundance of CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 41 of 114available food and shelter for wildlife. Removal of established invasive plants can require considerable effort; therefore prevention efforts are preferred. Since invasive species are often inadvertently introduced at disturbed sites, the City uses permitting to require development proponents (as appropriate) to submit an invasive species control plan which includes a description of invasive species present at the site and specifies methods for removal and control of invasive species, with required monitoring and written reporting with photographs of the areas of concern. Some invasive species known to be present in Woburn include: Japanese Knotweed, Oriental Bittersweet, Garlic Mustard, Common Reed, Common Buckthorn, Purple Loosestrife, Honeysuckle, Reed Canary-Grass, Tree of Heaven, Porcelain Berry, Spotted Knapweed, Parrot Feather, and Norway Maple. Canada Geese are also a concern, as are the Gypsy Moth, Hemlock Woody Adelgid, and the Emerald Ash Borer. We have had one reported possible sighting of the Asian Long-horned Beetle. EXTREME WEATHER HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS A hurricane is a violent wind and rainstorm with wind speeds of 74 to 200 miles per hour. A hurricane is strongest as it travels over the ocean and is particularly destructive to coastal property as the storm hits land. A tropical storm has similar characteristics, but wind speeds are between 34 and 73 miles per hour. Climate models suggest that hurricanes and tropical storms will become more intense as warmer ocean waters provide more fuel for the storms. In addition, rainfall amounts associated with hurricanes are predicted to increase because warmer air can hold more water vapor. Since 1900, 39 tropical storms have impacted New England (NESEC). Massachusetts has experienced approximately 32 tropical storms, nine Category 1 hurricanes, five Category 2 hurricanes and one Category 3 hurricane. Although uncommon, the City of Woburn’s entire area is vulnerable to hurricanes, which occur between June and November. As shown on Map 5 in Appendix B, a tropical storm tracked through Woburn in 1861. A hurricane or storm track is the line that delineates the path of the eye of a hurricane or tropical storm. The city also experiences the impacts of the wind and rain from hurricanes and tropical storms regardless of whether the storm track passed through the city. The hazard mapping indicates that the 100-year wind speed in Woburn is 110 miles per hour.

These are combined to estimate potential damage. The following gives an overview of the wind speeds, surges, and range of damage caused by different hurricane categories: Table 15: Saffir/Simpson Scale Scale No. (Category) Winds (mph) Surge (ft) Potential Damage 1 74 – 95 4 - 5 Minimal 2 96 – 110 6 - 8 Moderate 3 111 – 130 9 - 12 Extensive 4 131 – 155 13 - 18 Extreme 5 > 155 >18 Catastrophic Source: NOAA Hurricanes typically have regional impacts beyond their immediate tracks. Falling trees and branches are a significant problem because they can result in power outages when they fall on power lines or block traffic and emergency routes. Hurricanes are a city-wide hazard in Woburn. Potential hurricane damages to Woburn have been estimated using HAZUS-MH. Total damages are estimated at $25 million for a Category 2 hurricane and $103 million for a Category 4 hurricane. Hurricanes and tropical storms are a rare event having passed directly through Woburn only once. SEVERE WINTER STORM/NOR’EASTER A northeast storm, known as a nor’easter, is typically a large counterclockwise wind circulation around a low-pressure center. Featuring strong northeasterly winds blowing in from the ocean over coastal areas, nor’easters are relatively common in the winter months in New England occurring one to two times a year. The storm radius of a nor’easter can be as much as 1,000 miles and these storms feature sustained winds of 10 to 40 mph with gusts of up to 70 mph. These storms are accompanied by heavy rain or snow, depending on temperatures. Many of the historic flood events identified in the previous section were precipitated by nor’easters, including the “Perfect Storm” event in 1991. More recently, blizzards in February 2013, January 2015, and in March 2018 were large nor’easters that caused significant snowfall amounts. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 43 of 114Woburn is vulnerable to both the wind and precipitation that accompany nor’easters. High winds can cause damage to structures, fallen trees, and downed power lines leading to power outages. Intense rainfall can overwhelm drainage systems causing localized flooding of rivers and streams as well as urban stormwater ponding and localized flooding. Fallen tree limbs as well as heavy snow accumulation and intense rainfall can impede local transportation corridors, and block access for emergency vehicles. Nor’easters are also a cause of coastal flooding. A blizzard is a winter snow storm with sustained or frequent wind gusts to 35 mph or more, accompanied by falling or blowing snow which reduces visibility to or below ¼ mile. These conditions must be the predominant condition over a three-hour period. Extremely cold temperatures are often associated with blizzard conditions but are not a formal part of the definition. The hazard related to the combination of snow, wind, and low visibility significantly increases when temperatures drop below 20 degrees. The Regional Snowfall Index (RSI) characterizes and ranks the severity of northeast snowstorms. RSI has five categories: Extreme, Crippling, Major, Significant, and Notable. RSI scores are a function of the area affected by the snowstorm, the amount of snow, and the number of people living in the path of the storm. The largest RSI values result from storms producing heavy snowfall over large areas that include major metropolitan centers. The RSI categories are summarized below: Table 16: Regional Snowfall Index Category RSI Value Description 1 1 – 3 Notable 2 3-6 Significant 3 6-10 Major 4 10-18 Crippling 5 18+ Extreme Source: SHMCAP The most significant winter storm in recent history was the “Blizzard of 1978,” which resulted in over three feet of snowfall and multiple day closures of roadways, businesses, and schools. In Woburn, blizzards and severe winter storms have occurred in the following years: Table 17: Severe Weather Major Disaster Declarations in Eastern MA Storm Event Date Severe Winter Storm and Snowstorm March 2018 Severe Winter Storm, Snowstorm, and Flooding January 2015 Severe Winter Storm, Snowstorm, and Flooding February 2013 Hurricane Sandy October/November 2012 Severe Storm and Snowstorm October 2011 CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 44 of 114Tropical Storm Irene August 2011 Severe Winter Storm and Snowstorm January 2011 Severe Winter Storm and Flooding December 2008 Severe Storms and Inland and Coastal Flooding April 2007 Severe Storm and Flooding October 2005 Severe Storms & Flooding March 2001 Blizzard January 1966 Winter Coastal Storm December 1992 Severe Coastal Storm October 1991 Hurricane Bob August 1991 Hurricane Gloria September 1985 Coastal Storm, Flood, Ice, Snow February 1978 Hurricane, floods August 1955 Hurricanes September 1954 Source: FEMA Winter storms, including heavy snow, blizzards, and ice storms, are the most common and most familiar of the region’s hazards that affect large geographic areas. The majority of blizzards and ice storms in the region cause more inconvenience than they do serious property damage, injuries, or deaths. However, periodically, a storm will occur which is a true disaster, and necessitates intense large-scale emergency response. The impacts of winter storms are often related to the weight of snow and ice, which can cause roof collapses and also causes tree limbs to fall. This in turn can cause property damage and potential injuries. Power outages may also result from fallen trees and utility lines. Winter storms are a potential city-wide hazard in Woburn. Map 6 in Appendix A indicates that the average annual average snowfall in most of Woburn is between 48 and 72 inches. A number of public safety issues can arise during snow storms. Impassible streets are a challenge for emergency vehicles and affect residents and employers. Snow-covered sidewalks force people to walk in streets, which are already less safe due to snow, slush, puddles, and ice. Large piles of snow can also block sight lines for drivers, particularly at intersections. Refreezing of melting snow can cause dangerous roadway conditions. In addition, transit operations may be impacted, as they were in the 2015 blizzards which caused the closure of the MBTA system for one day and limited services on the commuter rail for several weeks. As with hurricanes, warmer ocean water and air will provide more fuel for winter storms. According to the SHMCAP it appears that Atlantic coast nor’easters are increasing in frequency and intensity. Further, the SHMCAP notes that research suggests that warmer weather in the Artic CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 45 of 114is producing changes to atmospheric circulation patterns that favor the development of winter storms in the Eastern United States. The City of Woburn does not keep local records of winter storms. Data for Middlesex County is the best available data to help understand previous occurrences and impacts of heavy snow events. According to National Climate Data Center (NCDC) records, from 2010 through 2020, Middlesex County experienced 19 heavy snowfall events, resulting in no injuries or deaths, and over a million dollars in property damage. Heavy snow is considered to be high frequency events based on past occurrences, as there have been 19 events in the past eleven years, for an average of almost 2 events each winter.

Hail size typically refers to the diameter of the hailstones. Warnings CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 46 of 114and reports may report hail size through comparisons with real-world objects that correspond to certain diameters: Table 19: Hail Size Comparisons Description Diameter (inches) Pea 0.25 Marble or mothball 0.50 Penny or dime 0.75 Nickel 0.88 Quarter 1.00 Half dollar 1.25 Walnut or ping pong ball 1.50 Golf ball 1.75 Hen's egg 2.00 Tennis ball 2.50 Baseball 2.75 Teacup 3.00 Grapefruit 4.00 Softball 4.50 Source: NOAA While ice pellets and sleet are examples of these, the greatest hazard is created by freezing rain conditions, which is rain that freezes on contact with hard surfaces leading to a layer of ice on roads, walkways, trees, and other surfaces. The conditions created by freezing rain can make driving particularly dangerous and emergency response more difficult. The weight of ice on tree branches can also lead to falling branches damaging electric lines. City-specific data for previous ice storm occurrences are not collected by the City of Woburn. The best available local data is for Middlesex County through the National Climatic Data Center. There were no ice storms in Middlesex County since 2010. Middlesex County did experience 27 hail events from 2010 through 2020. That is an average of 2.5 events each year. There is some indication that if winters warm, temperatures may be more likely to produce icing conditions.

These events are spawned by thunderstorms and occasionally by hurricanes and may occur singularly or in multiples. They develop when cool air overrides a layer of warm air, causing the warm air to rise rapidly. Most vortices remain suspended in the atmosphere. Should they touch down, they become a force of destruction. Some ingredients for tornado formation include: • Very strong winds in the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere • Clockwise turning of the wind with height (from southeast at the surface to west aloft) • Increasing wind speed with altitude in the lowest 10,000 feet of the atmosphere (i.e., 20 mph at the surface and 50 mph at 7,000 feet) • Very warm, moist air near the ground with unusually cooler air aloft • A forcing mechanism such as a cold front or leftover weather boundary from previous shower or thunderstorm activity CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 48 of 114Tornado damage severity is measured by the Enhanced Fujita scale, which is based on the amount of damage created. As of February 1, 2007, the National Weather Service began rating tornados using the Enhanced Fujita-scale (EF-scale), which allows surveyors to create more precise assessments of tornado severity. The EF-scale is summarized below: Table 21: Enhance Fujita Scale Source: SHMCAP 2018 The frequency of tornadoes in eastern Massachusetts is low; on average, there are six tornadoes that touchdown somewhere in the Northeast region every year. The strongest tornado in Massachusetts history was the Worcester Tornado in 1953 (NESEC). Recent tornado events in Massachusetts were in Springfield in 2011 and in Revere in 2014. The Springfield tornado caused significant damage and resulted in four deaths in June of 2011. The Revere tornado touched down in Chelsea just south of Route 16, moved north into Revere’s business district along Broadway, and ended near the intersection of Routes 1 and 60. The path was approximately two miles long and 3/8 mile wide, with wind speeds up to 120 miles per hour. Approximately 65 homes had substantial damages and 13 homes and businesses were rendered uninhabitable. Since 1950, there have been eighteen tornadoes in Middlesex County recorded by the Tornado History Project. None of the tornados impacted Woburn. There have been two F3 and four F2, CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 49 of 114and nine FI tornados. The eighteen tornadoes resulted in a total of one fatality and 7 injuries. Damage estimates range from 775,000 to and $3.7 million as summarized in Table 22. This an average of one tornado every 4 years.

Evacuation of impacted areas may be required on short notice. Sheltering and mass feeding efforts may be required along with debris clearance, search and rescue, and emergency fire and medical services. Key routes may be blocked by downed trees and other debris, and widespread power outages are also typically associated with tornadoes. Although tornadoes are a potential city-wide hazard in Woburn, tornado impacts are relatively localized compared to severe storms and hurricanes. Damages from any tornado in Woburn would greatly depend on the track of the tornado. Based on the record of previous occurrences since 1950, Tornado events in Woburn are a low frequency event as there has been no tornado activity in Woburn. According to the SHMCAP, it is possible that severe thunderstorms which can include tornadoes may increase in frequency and intensity. However, scientists have less confidence in the models that seek to project future changes in tornado activity. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 50 of 114OTHER SEVERE WEATHER SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS While less severe than the other types of storms discussed, thunderstorms can lead to localized damage and represent a hazard risk for communities. A thunderstorm typically features lightning, strong winds, rain, and/or hail. Thunderstorms sometime give rise to tornados. On average, these storms are only around 15 miles in diameter and last for about 30 minutes. A severe thunderstorm can include winds of close to 60 mph and rain sufficient to produce flooding. The severity of thunderstorms ranges from commonplace and of short duration to intense storms that cause damage due to high winds, flooding, or lightning strikes. The best available data on previous occurrences of thunderstorms in Woburn is for is for Middlesex County through the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). For the years 2015 through 2020, NCDC records show 41 thunderstorm events in Middlesex County (Table 23). These storms resulted in a total of $1.6 million in property damage. There were no injuries or deaths reported. This is an average of 7 events per year.

The city's vulnerability to severe thunderstorms is similar to that of nor'easters. High winds can cause falling trees and power outages, as well as obstruction of key routes and emergency access. Heavy precipitation may also cause localized flooding, both riverine and urban drainage related. Based on the record of previous occurrences, thunderstorms in Woburn are high frequency events as this hazard has occurred an average of seven times per year in the past six years. As noted previously, the intensity of rainfall events has increased significantly, and those trends are expected to continue. The SHMCAP does not specifically address whether climate will affect the intensity or frequency of thunderstorms. NON-CLIMATE INFLUENCED HAZARDS EARTHQUAKES Earthquakes are the sole natural hazard for which there is no established correlation with climate impacts. Damage in an earthquake stems from ground motion, surface faulting, and ground failure in which weak or unstable soils, such as those composed primarily of saturated sand or silts, liquefy. The effects of an earthquake are mitigated by distance and ground materials between the epicenter and a given location. An earthquake in New England affects a much wider area than a similar earthquake in California due to New England’s solid bedrock geology (NESEC). CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 52 of 114Seismologists use a magnitude scale known as the Richter scale to express the seismic energy released by each earthquake. The typical effects of earthquakes in various ranges are summarized below: Table 24: Richter Scale and Effects Richter Earthquake Effects Magnitudes Less than 3.5 Generally, not felt, but recorded 3.5- 5.4 Often felt, but rarely causes damage At most slight damage to well-designed buildings. Can cause major Under 6.0 damage to poorly constructed buildings over small regions. 6.1-6.9 Can be destructive in areas up to about 100 km. across where people live. 7.0- 7.9 Major earthquake. Can cause serious damage over larger areas. Great earthquake. Can cause serious damage in areas several hundred 8 or greater meters across. Source: Nevada Seismological Library (NSL), 2005 From 1668 to 2016, 408 earthquakes were recorded in Massachusetts (NESEC). Most have originated from the La Malbaie fault in Quebec or from the Cape Anne fault located off the coast of Rockport. The region has experienced larger earthquakes in the distant past, including a magnitude 5.0 earthquake in 1727 and a 6.0 earthquake that struck in 1755 off the coast of Cape Anne. More recently, a pair of damaging earthquakes occurred near Ossipee, NH in 1940. A 4.0 earthquake centered in Hollis, Maine in October 2012 was felt in the Boston area. Historic records of some of the more significant earthquakes in the region are shown in Table 25.

The range of peak ground acceleration in Massachusetts is from 10 %g to 20 %g, with a 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years. Woburn is in the 16 %g to 18 %g range, making it a moderate to high area of earthquake risk within the state, although the state as a whole is considered to have a low risk of earthquakes compared to the rest of the country. There have been no recorded earthquake epicenters within Woburn. Although New England has not experienced a damaging earthquake since 1755, seismologists state that a serious earthquake occurrence is possible. There are five seismological faults in Massachusetts, but there is no discernible pattern of previous earthquakes along these fault lines. Earthquakes occur without warning and may be followed by aftershocks. The majority of older buildings and infrastructure were constructed without specific earthquake resistant design features. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 54 of 114Figure 13: State of Massachusetts Earthquake Probability Map Earthquakes are a hazard with multiple impacts beyond the obvious building collapse. Buildings may suffer structural damage which may or may not be readily apparent. Earthquakes can cause major damage to roadways, making emergency response difficult. Water lines and gas lines can break, causing flooding and fires. Another potential vulnerability is equipment within structures. For example, a hospital may be structurally engineered to withstand an earthquake, but if the equipment inside the building is not properly secured, the operations at the hospital could be severely impacted during an earthquake. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides. According the SHMCAP there is a 10-15% chance of a magnitude 5 earthquake in a given ten- year period. Earthquakes are a potential city-wide hazard in Woburn. Although new construction under the most recent building codes generally will be built to seismic standards, much of the development in the city pre-dates the most recent building code. Potential earthquake damages to Woburn have been estimated using HAZUS-MH. Total building damages are estimated at $756 million for a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and $6.9 billion for a 7.0 magnitude earthquake. Other potential impacts are detailed in Table 31. LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT TRENDS Existing Land Use The most recent land use statistics available from the state are from aerial imagery completed in 2016. Table 26 shows the acreage and percentage of land in 11 categories. If the primary CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 55 of 114residential categories are aggregated, residential uses make up 39% of the area of the city. Commercial and industrial uses combined make up 19.6% of the city. Agriculture, and Open Land, total 15.7% of the land. The tax-exempt category represents 11.2% of Woburn’s land. Most of this land is additional open space.

Economic Elements Post-WWII development of Woburn was most influenced by the opening of Route 128 in 1951 and then I-93 in 1963. Woburn’s location at the crossroads of these two components of the regional highway system greatly influenced new industrial, commercial, and residential development beyond the historic City center. Access to the regional highway system has allowed commercial and industrial development to flourish. The major local roads providing north-south access are Main Street (Route 38), Cambridge Street (Route 3), and Washington Street. The major east-west routes are Lexington Street, Montvale Avenue and Salem Street. Most of these streets contain significant local retail nodes. __________________________________________________________________ NATURAL, CULTURAL, AND HISTORICAL RESOURCE AREAS The city has many historic sites including the First and Second Burial Grounds, the Baldwin Mansion, the Rumford House, the Battle Road Conservation Area, the 1790 House, the First Congregational Church, the Middlesex Canal, the Library, and the U.S. Post Office. Several of these properties are on the National Register of Historic Places. The city has 950 acres of publicly owned open space and recreation land. This represents 11% of the total acreage of the city. The largest of these areas is Horn Pond. Horn Pond is very popular for walking with a network of trails going around the pond. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 56 of 114DEVELOPMENT TRENDS Development trends throughout the metropolitan region are tracked by MAPC’s Development Database, which provides an inventory of new development over the last decade. The database tracks both completed developments and those currently under construction. In addition, the Planning Board Director provided data on projected finished since 2016. The database includes 11 completed projects. Where available we include several attributes of the new development, including site acreage, housing units, and commercial space. Six of the completed projects are housing projects, and five are commercial. The completed projects in Woburn include a total of 449 housing units and just over 500,000 square feet of commercial space (see Table 27).

In order to characterize any change in the city’s vulnerability associated with new developments, a GIS mapping analysis was conducted which overlaid the development sites with the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map and the hottest 5% of land surface in the MAPC region. These areas are listed below with their flood and heat risk outlined in Table 28. This information is provided so that planners can ensure that development proposals comply with floodplain zoning and that careful attention is paid to drainage, heat, and other issues.

A vulnerability assessment and estimation of damages was performed for hurricanes, earthquakes, and flooding through the HAZUS-MH software. Introduction to HAZUS-MH HAZUS- MH (multiple-hazards) is a computer program developed by FEMA to estimate losses due to a variety of natural hazards. The following overview of HAZUS-MH is taken from the FEMA website. For more information on the HAZUS-MH software, go to https://www.fema.gov/hazus/ “HAZUS-MH is a nationally applicable standardized methodology and software program that contains models for estimating potential losses from earthquakes, floods, and hurricane winds. HAZUS-MH was developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under contract with the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). Loss estimates produced by HAZUS-MH are based on current scientific and engineering knowledge of the effects of hurricane winds, floods, and earthquakes. Estimating losses is essential to decision-making at all levels of government, providing a basis for developing and evaluating mitigation plans and policies as well as emergency preparedness, response, and recovery planning. HAZUS-MH uses state-of-the-art geographic information system (GIS) software to map and display hazard data and the results of damage and economic loss estimates for buildings and infrastructure. It also allows users to estimate the impacts of hurricane winds, floods and earthquakes on populations.” There are three modules included with the HAZUS-MH software: hurricane wind, flooding, and earthquakes. There are also three levels at which HAZUS-MH can be run. Level 1 uses national baseline data and is the quickest way to begin the risk assessment process. The analysis that follows was completed using Level 1 data. Level 1 relies upon default data on building types, utilities, transportation, etc. from national databases as well as census data. While the databases include a wealth of information on the City of Woburn, it does not capture all relevant information. In fact, the HAZUS training manual notes that the default data is “subject to a great deal of uncertainty.” However, for the purposes of this plan, the analysis is useful. This plan is attempting to generally indicate the possible extent of damages due to certain types of natural disasters and to allow for a comparison between different types of disasters. Therefore, this analysis should be considered to be a starting point for understanding potential damages from the hazards. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 65 of 114ESTIMATED DAMAGES FROM HURRICANES The HAZUS software was used to model potential damages to the community from a 100-year and 500-year hurricane event; storms that are 1% and 0.2% likely to happen in a given year, and roughly equivalent to a Category 2 and Category 4 hurricane. The damages caused by these hypothetical storms were modeled as if the storm track passed directly through the city, bringing the strongest winds and greatest damage potential. Though there are no recorded instances of a hurricane equivalent to a 500-year storm passing through Massachusetts, this model was included in order to present a reasonable “worst case scenario” that would help planners and emergency personnel evaluate the impacts of storms that might be more likely in the future, as we enter into a period of more intense and frequent storms.

People who may be more susceptible to negative health effects can include older adults, young children, pregnant women, people with disabilities, and people with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more likely to be physically vulnerable to the health impacts of extreme heat and poor air quality. Individuals with physical mobility constraints may need additional assistance with emergency response. Older adults are often at elevated risk due to a high prevalence of pre- existing and chronic conditions. People who live in substandard housing and in housing without air conditioning have increased vulnerability to heat-related illnesses. Black and Latino residents in Massachusetts are hospitalized for asthma at considerably higher rates than the population as whole, reflecting the reality that longstanding societal inequities can lead to differential health outcomes based on race and ethnicity. Low-income people are often more susceptible to financial shocks, which can occur after extreme weather, and which can impact financial security and the ability to secure safe shelter and meet medical needs. Social isolation can also influence vulnerability, as it limits access to critical information, municipal resources, and social support systems. In the absence of strong social support networks and translation services, people living alone and those with limited English language proficiency may experience social isolation. People of color and undocumented immigrants may also experience social isolation where there are historically strained or tenuous relationships with government officials and first responders. Certain occupations may also experience more severe impacts. People who work outdoors, or in unregulated temperatures, are at increased risk for heat-related illnesses. In developing mitigation measures Woburn will want to consider the needs of all of its residents. In Woburn 8% of residents are below the poverty level (4-person household earning less than $24,563) and 39% are low-income (4-person household earning less than $78,150) (American Community Survey). 4% of residents are limited English speaking, and 18% speak another CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 68 of 114language at home (Census 2010). The over 65 population is growing, and 29% of residents 65 or older live alone (Census 2010). As is true at the statewide level, Black and Latino residents are hospitalized for asthma at much higher rates than White residents (MA DPH).

All of the goals are considered critical for the city, and they are not listed in order of importance. Prior to the Hazard Mitigation Plan update process, the City of Woburn developed a Climate Change Vulnerability Analysis and Action Plan. The local team chose to incorporate climate considerations as noted in Goal 10. GOAL 1. Prevent and reduce the loss of life, injury and property damages resulting from all major natural hazards. GOAL 2. Identify and seek funding for measures to mitigate or eliminate each known significant flood hazard area. GOAL 3. Integrate hazard mitigation planning as an integral factor in all relevant municipal departments, committees, and boards. • Ensure that the Planning Department considers hazard mitigation in its review and permitting of new development. • Review zoning regulations to ensure that the ordinance incorporates all reasonable hazard mitigation provisions. • Ensure that all relevant municipal departments have the resources to continue to enforce codes and regulations related to hazard mitigation. GOAL 4. Prevent and reduce the damage to public infrastructure resulting from all hazards. • Begin to assess the vulnerability of municipal buildings and infrastructure to damage from an earthquake. • Maintain existing mitigation infrastructure in good condition. GOAL 5. Encourage the business community, major institutions, and non-profits to work with the City to develop, review and implement the hazard mitigation plan. GOAL 6. Work with surrounding communities, state, regional and federal agencies to ensure regional cooperation and solutions for hazards affecting multiple communities. • Continue to participate in the Mystic Region REPC and Region IV A (Board of Health). GOAL 7. Ensure that future development meets federal, state, and local standards for preventing and reducing the impacts of natural hazards. GOAL 8. Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures that can be undertaken by property-owners. • Provide information on hazard mitigation activities in the languages most frequently spoken in Woburn. GOAL 9. Take maximum advantage of resources from FEMA and MEMA to educate City staff and the public about hazard mitigation. GOAL 10. Consider the potential impacts of future climate change. Incorporate climate sustainability and resiliency in hazard mitigation planning. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 71 of 114SECTION 6: EXISTING MITIGATION MEASURES The existing protections in the City of Woburn are a combination of zoning, land use, and environmental regulations, infrastructure maintenance, and drainage infrastructure improvement projects. Infrastructure maintenance generally addresses localized drainage clogging problems, while large scale capacity problems may require pipe replacement or invert elevation modifications. These more expensive projects are subject to the capital budget process and lack of funding is one of the biggest obstacles to completion of some of these. The City's existing mitigation measures, which were in place prior to the original 2005 Plan, are listed by hazard type here and are summarized in Table 33 below. Many upgrades to existing measures are noted in the following sections. EXISTING MULTI-HAZARD MITIGATION MEASURES Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) –. The city has an up-to-date CEMP plan that meets the state’s requirements. Enforcement of the State Building Code – The Massachusetts State Building Code contains many detailed regulations regarding wind loads, earthquake resistant design, flood-proofing, and snow loads. Regional Emergency Planning Committee (REPC) – The Mystic REPC serves as the emergency planning committee for 19 cities and towns. The Mystic REPC’s 19 member cities and towns work together to develop plans to educate, communicate, and protect their communities in case of natural and man-made emergencies. The Massachusetts Public Health Emergency Preparedness Region 4A – Woburn is a member of Region 4A, one of 15 regions within Massachusetts and is comprised of 33 cities and towns throughout the metro west area, which together form the General Coalition (GC). EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR FLOOD-RELATED HAZARDS Woburn employs a number of practices to help minimize potential flooding and impacts from flooding, and to maintain existing drainage infrastructure. Existing city-wide mitigation measures include the following: National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) – Woburn participates in the NFIP with 43 policies in force as of the January 11, 2021. FEMA maintains a database on flood insurance policies and claims. This database can be found on the FEMA website at http://www.fema.gov/business/nfip/statistics/pcstat.shtm Flood insurance policies in force ( as of January 11, 2021) 43 Coverage amounts of flood insurance policies $16,059,500 CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE EXISTING MITIGATION MEASURES 72 of 114Premiums paid $64,512 Closed losses (Losses that have been paid) 39 Total payments (Total amount paid on losses) $832,770 Since the 2016 plan, the policies in force have decreased by 6 and the closed losses have not changed. The City complies with the NFIP by enforcing floodplain regulations, maintaining up-to- date floodplain maps, and providing information to property owners and builders regarding floodplains and building requirements. City Storm Drain System- All streets are swept once a year at a minimum and usually twice a year. The main roads are generally swept three or four times with some roads being done more frequently. Catch basin cleaning is also done annually. The DPW has a preventative maintenance plan and if flash floods or other storm events are forecast, they have a list of culverts and catch basins that are checked and cleaned if necessary. The DPW has three pieces of equipment and does all of the work in-house. Maintenance of the water distribution system: The City is in its ninth year of a cleaning and relining program as well as replacing gates and valves. The exercise of valves and gates is done as part of the flushing program. In the past two years the DPW has been using an iPad to log in information as it undertakes this work. Zoning ordinance–The relevant section of the zoning ordinance is Section 9: Floodway and Flood Plain Districts. Subdivision regulations – The Woburn Planning Board’s Land Subdivision Rules and Regulations – 1998 Edition – contain standards for drainage on subdivisions. EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR DAM-RELATED HAZARDS DCR dam safety regulations apply to Scalley Dam at Horn Pond. Woburn is working with Winchester on improving dam operations. EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR WIND-RELATED HAZARDS CEMP: The CEMP addresses wind risks. Massachusetts State Building Code - The City has adopted the Massachusetts State Building Code. The Massachusetts State Building Code contains detailed regulations regarding wind loads. Tree trimming – Under the direction of the tree warden the city maintains public shade trees within the public right-of-way. When EverSource needs to remove or trim a shade tree they will call and meet the Tree Warden on site before any work is done. EverSource also sends a plan 1 year in advance before any major work is done. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE EXISTING MITIGATION MEASURES 73 of 114EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR WINTER-RELATED HAZARDS Building Code – The Building Code addresses snow loads. Snow Removal – The City utilizes two areas for snow disposal. One is the ball field at the Veterans School off of School Street and the other is a smaller, satellite area at Saint Anthony’s Church on Main Street. The city does not dump snow into Horn Pond because it is the City’s water supply. Road treatment -The City uses a combination of sand and salt to treat the roads during the winter. The city is careful to minimize the use of sand and salt on Arlington Road because of its proximity to the water supply at Horn Pond. The city also minimizes the use of salt on roads adjacent to wetlands. Salt is used primarily when there is a hilly road where safety takes precedence. Due to environmental concerns and economics, the trend in snow and ice control has been to reduce the volume of sand that is mixed with salt. The DPW has phased out the use of sand. There has also been a concerted effort to reduce the volume of salt used during storms by supplementing the application of salt with chemical enhancements such as calcium chloride. EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR FIRE-RELATED HAZARDS Outdoor burning – Outdoor burning is regulated by the Department of Environmental Protection, which allows outdoor burning of brush, cane, forestry debris, etc. during an annual period usually from January 15th through May 1st under the supervision and control of the Fire Department. Permits are issued during the annual period each year between the hours of 9:30 AM and 2:00 PM. The Woburn Fire Department web page contains a link with more information on outdoor burning. Development review –The Fire Department is involved in reviewing new developments. EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR GEOLOGIC HAZARDS Massachusetts State Building Code – The State Building Code contains a section on designing for earthquake loads (780 CMR 1612.0). COMPILATION OF EXISTING MITIGATION Table 33 summarizes the many existing natural hazard mitigation measures already in place in Woburn when the first Hazard Mitigation Plan was developed in 2016. Because of the number of entities, public and private, involved in natural hazard mitigation, it is likely that this list is a starting point for a more comprehensive inventory of all measures.

CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE EXISTING MITIGATION MEASURES 75 of 114MITIGATION CAPABILITIES AND LOCAL CAPACITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION Under the Massachusetts system of “Home Rule,” the City of Woburn is authorized to adopt and from time to time amend local ordinances and regulations that support the city’s capabilities to mitigate natural hazards. These include Zoning Ordinances, Subdivision and Site Plan Review Regulations, Wetlands Ordinance, Health Regulations, Public Works regulations, and local enforcement of the State Building Code. Local Ordinances may be amended by the City Council to improve the city’s capabilities, and changes to most regulations simply require a public hearing and a vote of the authorized board or commission. The City of Woburn has recognized several existing mitigation measures that require implementation or improvements and has the capacity within its local boards and departments to address these. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE EXISTING MITIGATION MEASURES 76 of 114SECTION 7: MITIGATION MEASURES FROM PREVIOUS PLAN IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS ON THE PREVIOUS PLAN At a meeting of the Woburn Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee, City staff reviewed the mitigation measures identified in the 2016 Woburn Hazard Mitigation Plan and determined whether each measure had been implemented or deferred. Of those measures that had been deferred, the committee evaluated whether the measure should be deleted or carried forward into this Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update. The decision on whether to delete or retain a particular measure was based on the committee’s assessment of the continued relevance or effectiveness of the measure and whether the deferral of action on the measure was due to the inability of the city to act on the measure. Table 34 summarizes the status of mitigation measures from the 2016 plan. Table 34: Mitigation Measures from the 2016 Plan Priority Include Mitigation Action in 2016 Current Status in 2021 plan Plan?

Considerable work has been done to address drainage problems citywide. Three drainage projects were completed, and progress was made to reduce flooding on four additional projects. Progress was also made on stream, culvert and catch basin maintenance. A number of projects that were partially completed or not initiated have been continued into this plan update. The city also did outreach regarding heat risks, evaluated snow loads for some of its buildings, and is currently considering language restricting non-essential use of public water supply. Overall, fifteen mitigation measures from the 2016 plan will be continued in the plan update. Most retain the same priority in this 2021 Update. Moving forward into the next five-year plan implementation period there will be many more opportunities to incorporate hazard mitigation into the City’s decision-making processes. The challenges the city faces in implementing these measures are primarily due to limited funding and available staff time. This plan should help the city prioritize the best use of its limited resources for enhanced mitigation of natural hazards. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE MITIGATION MEASURES FROM PREVIOUS PLAN 78 of 114SECTION 8: HAZARD MITIGATION STRATEGY WHAT IS HAZARD MITIGATION? Hazard mitigation means to permanently reduce or alleviate the losses of life, injuries and property resulting from natural hazards through long-term strategies. These long-term strategies include planning, policy changes, education programs, infrastructure projects and other activities. FEMA currently has three mitigation grant programs: the Hazards Mitigation Grant Program (HGMP), the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program (PDM), and the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program. The three links below provide additional information on these programs. https://www.fema.gov/hazard-mitigation-grant-program https://www.fema.gov/pre-disaster-mitigation-grant-program https://www.fema.gov/flood-mitigation-assistance-grant-program Hazard Mitigation Measures can generally be sorted into the following groups: • Prevention: Government administrative or regulatory actions or processes that influence the way land and buildings are developed and built. These actions also include public activities to reduce hazard losses. Examples include planning and zoning, building codes, capital improvement programs, open space preservation, and stormwater management regulations. • Property Protection: Actions that involve the modification of existing buildings or infrastructure to protect them from a hazard or removal from the hazard area. Examples include acquisition, elevation, relocation, structural retrofits, flood proofing, storm shutters, and shatter resistant glass. • Public Education & Awareness: Actions to inform and educate citizens, elected officials, and property owners about the potential risks from hazards and potential ways to mitigate them. Such actions include outreach projects, real estate disclosure, hazard information centers, and school-age and adult education programs. • Natural Resource Protection: Actions that, in addition to minimizing hazard losses also preserve or restore the functions of natural systems. These actions include sediment and erosion control, stream corridor restoration, watershed management, forest and vegetation management, and wetland restoration and preservation. • Structural Projects: Actions that involve the construction of structures to reduce the impact of a hazard. Such structures include storm water controls (e.g., culverts), floodwalls, seawalls, retaining walls, and safe rooms. • Emergency Services Protection: Actions that will protect emergency services before, during, and immediately after an occurrence. Examples of these actions include protection of warning system capability, protection of critical facilities, and protection of emergency response infrastructure. (Source: FEMA Local Multi-Hazard Mitigation Planning Guidance) CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 79 of 114REGIONAL AND INTER-COMMUNITY CONSIDERATIONS Some hazard mitigation issues are strictly local. The problem originates primarily within the municipality and can be solved at the municipal level. Other issues are inter-community and require cooperation between two or more municipalities. There is a third level of mitigation which is regional and may involve a state, regional or federal agency, or three or more municipalities. REGIONAL PARTNERS In developed urban and suburban communities such as the metropolitan Boston area, mitigating natural hazards, particularly flooding, is more than a local issue. The drainage systems that serve these communities are complex systems of storm drains, roadway drainage structures, pump stations and other facilities owned and operated by a wide array of agencies including the City, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of these structures are integral to the flood hazard mitigation efforts of communities. These agencies must be considered the communities’ regional partners in hazard mitigation. These agencies also operate under the same constraints as communities do including budgetary and staffing constraints and they must make decisions about numerous competing priorities. Following, is a brief overview of regional facilities found in Woburn and a discussion of inter- municipal issues. OVERVIEW OF REGIONAL FACILITIES WITHIN WOBURN Major facilities owned, operated, and maintained by state or regional entities include: • State Routes 128, 38, and 3/3A (MassDOT) • Commuter Rail Mishawum and Anderson/Woburn stations (MBTA) INTER-COMMUNITY CONSIDERATIONS Mitigation measures for the following regional issues should be considered as Woburn develops its own local plan: A) Coordinate and Review Developments on a Regional Basis As Woburn and the surrounding communities are undergoing development, it is vital that these communities communicate and provide input during the review processes. When addressing housing, transportation, and economic development projects, the impacts to neighbors must be addressed. Woburn is a member of the North Suburban Planning Council (NSPC) of MAPC. NSPC includes the 8 surrounding communities who meet regularly to share information on planning issues. B) Watershed Management CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 80 of 114The Aberjona River is a tributary to the Mystic River. Woburn is working closely with the Mystic River Watershed Association and its member communities to collaborate on projects and sharing information. The group has been tackling issues related to stormwater management, flooding, water use, and climate change. NEW DEVELOPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE As part of the process of developing recommendations for new mitigation measures for this plan update, the City considered the issues related to new development, redevelopment, and infrastructure needs in order limit future risks. Taking into consideration the Wetlands Act and ordinance enforced by the Conservation Commission and adoption of more stringent stormwater regulations, the city determined that existing regulatory measures are taking good advantage of local Home Rule land use regulatory authority to minimize natural hazard impacts of development. Priorities in this plan include a focus on regulatory updates designed to reduce future flooding. PROCESS FOR SETTING PRIORITIES FOR MITIGATION MEASURES The last step in developing the City’s mitigation strategy is to assign a level of priority to each mitigation measure so as to guide the focus of the City’s limited resources towards those actions with the greatest potential benefit. At this stage in the process, the Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team had limited access to detailed analyses of the cost and benefits of any given mitigation measure, so prioritization is based on the local team members’ understanding of existing and potential hazard impacts and an approximate sense of the costs associated with pursuing any given mitigation measure. Priority setting was based on local knowledge of the hazard areas, including impacts of hazard events, the extent of the area impacted, and the relation of a given mitigation measure to the City’s goals. In addition, the local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team also took into consideration factors such as the number of homes and businesses affected, whether or not road closures occurred and what impact closures had on delivery of emergency services and the local economy, anticipated project costs, whether any environmental constraints existed, and whether the city would be able to justify the costs relative to the anticipated benefits. Table 35 below demonstrates the prioritization of the City’s potential hazard mitigation measures. For each mitigation measure, the geographic extent of the potential benefiting area is identified as is an estimate of the overall benefit and cost of the measures. The benefits, costs, and overall priority were evaluated in terms of: Estimated Benefits Action will result in a significant reduction of hazard risk to people and/or property from a High hazard event Action will likely result in a moderate reduction of hazard risk to people and/or property Medium from a hazard event CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 81 of 114Action will result in a low reduction of hazard risk to people and/or property from a hazard Low event Estimated Costs High Estimated costs greater than $100,000 Medium Estimated costs between $10,000 to $100,000 Low Estimated costs less than $10,000 and/or staff time Priority Action very likely to have political and public support and necessary maintenance can occur High following the project, and the costs seem reasonable considering likely benefits from the measure Medium Action may have political and public support and necessary maintenance has potential to occur following the project HAZARD MITIGATION STRATEGY Low Not clear if action has political and public support and not certain that necessary maintenance can occur following the project INTRODUCTION TO MITIGATION MEASURES TABLE Description of the Mitigation Measure – The description of each mitigation measure is brief and cost information is given only if cost data were already available from the community. The cost data represent a point in time and would need to be adjusted for inflation and for any changes or refinements in the design of a particular mitigation measure. Priority – As described above and summarized in Table 35, the designation of high, medium, or low priority was done considering potential benefits and estimated project costs, as well as other factors in the STAPLEE (Social, Technical, Administrative, Legal, Economic, and Environmental) analysis. Implementation Responsibility – The designation of implementation responsibility was done based on a general knowledge of what each municipal department is responsible for. It is likely that most mitigation measures will require that several departments work together and assigning staff is the sole responsibility of the governing body of each community. Time Frame – The time frame was based on a combination of the priority for that measure, the complexity of the measure and whether or not the measure is conceptual, in design, or already designed and awaiting funding. Because the time frame for this plan is five years, the timing for all mitigation measures has been kept within this framework. The identification of a likely time frame is not meant to constrain a community from taking advantage of funding opportunities as they arise. Potential Funding Sources – This column attempts to identify the most likely sources of funding for a specific measure. The information on potential funding sources in this table is preliminary and varies depending on a number of factors. These factors include whether or not a mitigation measure has been studied, evaluated, or designed, or if it is still in the conceptual stages. MEMA CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 82 of 114and DCR assisted MAPC in reviewing the potential eligibility for hazard mitigation funding. Each grant program and agency has specific eligibility requirements that would need to be taken into consideration. In most instances, the measure will require a number of different funding sources. Identification of a potential funding source in this table does not guarantee that a project will be eligible for, or selected for, funding. Upon adoption of this plan, the local team responsible for its implementation should begin to explore the funding sources in more detail. Additional information on funding sources – The best way to determine eligibility for a particular funding source is to review the project with a staff person at the funding agency. The following websites provide an overview of programs and funding sources. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) – The website for the North Atlantic district office is http://www.nae.usace.army.mil/. The ACOE provides assistance in a number of types of projects including shoreline/streambank protection, flood damage reduction, flood plain management services and planning services. Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) – The grants page https://www.mass.gov/hazard-mitigation-assistance-grant-programs describes the various Hazard Mitigation Assistance Program.

Install hydrodynamic separators at four outfalls. Cambridge Road – This project seeks to upgrade the drainage system to handle a larger volume of flow by replacing the existing drain under Cambridge Road with a 30-inch pipe. Hart Street/Winn Street -- Cleaning of the Hart Street area stream and culvert under Winn Street General stream maintenance- Sediment and debris and trash have decreased the hydraulic capacity of streams and drainage swales. Trash removal and dredging of approximately 10,000 linear feet is necessary. General stream culvert maintenance – Some culverts in the city have become blocked with sediment, debris, and trash. The report identifies 20 culverts in need of cleaning. Lake Terrace and Lake Circle Drainage Improvements – Clean, inspect and evaluate storm drain lines, manholes and catch basins. Install additional catch basins and drain manholes. Washington Street near Cedar Street (Staples) – This drainage project consists of installing a parallel relief system to convey stormwater under Washington Street. Gill street – Flooding occurs at the end of Gill Street due to inadequate drainage. Investigate clearing the drainage ditch and establishing better drainage to Hall’s Brook. Drainage improvement at Prospect St and Jefferson Avenue – Drainage work is needed hear due to an undersized 60-inch culvert. Investigate sources of stormwater flooding – As noted in this plan, stormwater flooding occurs in many locations outside of FEMA flood zones. The City will analyze flooding locations and reach out to residents to investigate historic flood damage. Provide property retrofit materials to residents – The City will develop materials and do outreach to encourage adoption of property retrofit strategies. New Boston St. at Hall’s Brook – Flooding from Hall’s Brook impacts the roadway. Drainage improvements are needed. Prospect Street and Jefferson Avenue – Flooding due to drainage issues occurs at the intersection and up to Garfield Street and along the wetlands area between Auburn Avenue and Hanson Court. Drought Encourage water conservation – Develop materials for residents. Consider additional strategies such as encouraging use of rain barrels. Landslide Identify landslide risks – Assess potential for landslides. Notify affected properties as appropriate. Extreme Heat and Heatwaves Conduct a public awareness campaign about the risk of extreme temperatures – Extreme heat and cold can have impacts on residents as well as on property. Extreme heat and cold can be CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 86 of 114deadly for sensitive populations such as the elderly and extreme cold can lead to freezing pipes and damage for property-owners. A public education campaign could use print publications as well as social media to both educate residents and alert them to times when these conditions are anticipated. Review HVAC capacity for municipal buildings – Investigate and improve cooling capacity in the municipal and school buildings that have not been updated. Wildfires Consider becoming a Firewise Community – The national Firewise Communities program offers communities a structured way to undertake community-based activities to lessen the impact of brush fires. Purchase a brush truck – The Fire Department would like to purchase a brush truck to be better equipped to respond to brush fires. Invasive Species Manage invasives through permitting requirements - Utilize permit conditions issued by the Conservation Commission, Planning Board, and others to remove and control invasive species, particularly on large development parcels. Severe Winter Storm/Nor’easter Public awareness campaign – The City should increase its public awareness activities including the use of social media and written materials on winter hazards that would be available at City Hall and mailed to residents with their tax bills. Multihazards Increase funding of tree management work – Funding would increase the capacity of the DPW to manage street trees, addressing and reducing damage caused by wind and other sources. (This item addresses Hurricanes and Tropical Storms, Tornadoes, and Other Severe Weather.) Adopt a climate action plan – A climate action plan will focus on strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This will help address long-term climate impacts, as well as developing alternate energy strategies that can reduce vulnerability to power outages. Earthquake Implement seismic upgrades to the communications center - The Public Safety building should be reviewed to determine if changes are needed in order to be brought up to seismic standards. This review would help determine and address the potential for a collapse of the communications system that would impact the City’s ability to respond to emergencies after an earthquake. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 87 of 114SECTION 9: PLAN ADOPTION & MAINTENANCE PLAN ADOPTION The Woburn Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update was adopted by the Mayor on [ADD DATE]. See Appendix D for documentation. The plan was approved by FEMA on [ADD DATE] for a five- year period that will expire on [ADD DATE]. PLAN MAINTENANCE MAPC worked with the Woburn Hazard Mitigation Team to prepare this plan. This group will continue to meet on an as-needed basis to coordinate the implementation and maintenance of this plan. A member of the City staff will be designated as the team coordinator. Additional members could be added to the local team from businesses, non-profits, and institutions. The city will encourage public participation during the next 5-year planning cycle. As updates and a review of the plan are conducted by the Hazard Mitigation Team, these will be placed on the City’s web site, and any meetings of the Hazard Mitigation Team will be publicly noticed in accordance with city and state open meeting laws. IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION SCHEDULE Mid-Term Survey on Progress – The coordinator of the Hazard Mitigation Team will prepare and distribute a survey in year three of the plan. The survey will be distributed to all the local team members and other interested local stakeholders. The survey will poll the members on progress and accomplishments for implementation, any new hazards or problem areas that have been identified, and any changes or revisions to the plan that may be needed. This information will be used to prepare a report or addendum to the local hazard mitigation plan in order to evaluate its effectiveness in meeting the plan’s goals and identify areas that need to be updated in the next plan. The Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team will have primary responsibility for tracking progress, evaluating, and updating the plan. Begin to Prepare for the next Plan Update – FEMA’s approval of this plan is valid for five years, by which time an updated plan must be approved by FEMA in order to maintain the City’s approved plan status and its eligibility for FEMA mitigation grants. Given the lead time needed to secure funding and conduct the planning process, the Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team will begin to prepare for an update of the plan in year three. This will help the City avoid a lapse in its approved plan status and grant eligibility when the current plan expires. The Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team will use the information from the Mid-Term progress review to identify the needs and priorities for the plan update and seek funding for the plan update process. Potential sources of funding may include FEMA Pre-Disaster Mitigation grants and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Both grant programs can pay for 75% of a planning project, with a 25% local cost share required. Prepare and Adopt an Updated Local Hazard Mitigation Plan – Once the resources have been secured to update the plan, the Hazard Mitigation Team may decide to undertake the update themselves, contract with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council to update the plan or to hire another consultant. However, the Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team decides to update the CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 88 of 114plan, the city will need to review the current FEMA hazard mitigation plan guidelines for any changes in requirements for hazard mitigation plans since the previous plan. Once the next plan update is prepared, the City will submit it to MEMA and FEMA for review and approval and adopt the plan update in order to obtain formal FEMA approval of the plan. INTEGRATION OF THE PLANS WITH OTHER PLANNING INITIATIVES Upon approval of the Woburn Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update by FEMA, the Local Hazard Mitigation Team will provide all interested parties and implementing departments with a copy of the plan and will initiate a discussion regarding how the plan can be integrated into that department’s ongoing work. At a minimum, the plan will be reviewed and discussed with the following departments: • Fire/Emergency Management • Police • Public Works • Planning • Engineering • Building Department • Conservation Other groups that will be coordinated with include large institutions, Chambers of Commerce, land conservation organizations and watershed groups. The plan will also be posted on the City’s website with the caveat that a local team coordinator will review the plan for sensitive information that would be inappropriate for public posting. The posting of the plan on the website will include a mechanism for citizen feedback such as an e-mail address to send comments. The hazard mitigation plan provided crucial data and analysis for the climate resilience planning completed by the city and referenced in Appendix E. The plan has contributed to a focus on stormwater management including the adoption of a Stormwater Ordinance and associated regulations. The Hazard Mitigation Plan will also be integrated into other city plans and policies as they are updated and renewed, including the Open Space and Recreation Plan, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, Master Plan, and Capital Plan.

        "SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Hazard Mitigation planning is a proactive effort to identify actions that can be taken to reduce the dangers to life and property from natural hazard events. In the communities of the Boston region of Massachusetts, hazard mitigation planning tends to focus most on flooding, the most likely natural hazard to impact these communities. This plan considers how our warming climate will affect natural hazards. Warming temperatures will fuel changing precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and an increasing frequency and intensity of severe storms. The Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 requires all municipalities that wish to be eligible to receive FEMA funding for hazard mitigation grants, to adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan and update this plan in five-year intervals. PLANNING PROCESS Planning for the Hazard Mitigation Plan update was led by the Woburn Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team, composed of staff from a number of different city departments. the team met on March 16, 2021, April 22, 2021, and July 13, 2021, and discussed where the impacts of natural hazards most affect the city, the effects of climate change, goals for addressing these impacts, updates to the City’s existing mitigation measures, and new or revised hazard mitigation measures that would benefit the city. Public participation in this planning process is important for improving awareness of the potential impacts of natural hazards and to build support for the actions the city takes to mitigate them. The City’s Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team hosted two public meetings. The first meeting was held via Zoom on June 3, 2021. The second meeting on July 27, 2021, was held before the Planning Board via Zoom and the draft plan update was posted on the City’s website for public review. Key city stakeholders and neighboring communities were notified and invited to review the draft plan and submit comments. RISK ASSESSMENT The Woburn Hazard Mitigation Plan assesses the potential impacts to the city from flooding, high winds, winter storms, brush fire, geologic hazards, extreme temperatures, drought, and invasive species. For each risk, the assessment identifies the projected impacts of a warming climate. These are shown in the map series in Appendix B. The Woburn Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team identified 166 Critical Facilities. These are also shown on the map series and listed in Table 29, identifying which facilities are located within the mapped hazard zones. Hazards U.S. – Multihazards (HAZUS-MH) is a standardized methodology developed by FEMA that utilizes Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to estimate physical, economic, and social impacts of disasters. The HAZUS-MH analysis for Woburn estimates property damages from Hurricanes of category 2 and 4 ($25 million to $103 million), earthquakes of magnitudes 5 and 7 ($756 million to $6.9 billion), and the 1% and .2% chance of flooding ($31 to $41 million).

        "HAZARD MITIGATION GOALS The Woburn Local Multiple Hazard Community Planning Team endorsed the following ten hazard mitigation goals at the April 22, 2021, team meeting. The team added a tenth goal focused on incorporating future climate change projections. 1. Prevent and reduce the loss of life, injury and property damages resulting from all major natural hazards. 2. Identify and seek funding for measures to mitigate or eliminate each known significant flood hazard area. 3. Integrate hazard mitigation planning as an integral factor in all relevant municipal departments, committees, and boards. • Ensure that the Planning Department considers hazard mitigation in its review and permitting of new development. • Review zoning regulations to ensure that the ordinance incorporates all reasonable hazard mitigation provisions. • Ensure that all relevant municipal departments have the resources to continue to enforce codes and regulations related to hazard mitigation. 4. Prevent and reduce the damage to public infrastructure resulting from all hazards. • Begin to assess the vulnerability of municipal buildings and infrastructure to damage from an earthquake. • Maintain existing mitigation infrastructure in good condition. 5. Encourage the business community, major institutions, and non-profits to work with the city to develop, review, and implement the hazard mitigation plan. 6. Work with surrounding communities, state, regional and federal agencies to ensure regional cooperation and solutions for hazards affecting multiple communities. • Continue to participate in the Mystic Region REPC and Region IV A (Board of Health). 7.

Take maximum advantage of resources from FEMA and MEMA to educate City staff and the public about hazard mitigation. 10. Consider the potential impacts of future climate change. Incorporate climate sustainability and resiliency in hazard mitigation planning. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 7 of 114",
        "HAZARD MITIGATION STRATEGY The Woburn Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team identified a number of mitigation measures that would serve to reduce the City’s vulnerability to natural hazard events. Overall, the hazard mitigation strategy recognizes that mitigating hazards for Woburn will be an ongoing process as our understanding of natural hazards and the steps that can be taken to mitigate their damages changes over time. Global climate change and a variety of other factors impact the City’s vulnerability in the future, and local officials will need to work together across municipal lines and with state and federal agencies in order to understand and address these changes. The Hazard Mitigation Strategy will be incorporated into the City’s other related plans and policies. PLAN REVIEW & UPDATE PROCESS The process for developing Woburn’s Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update is summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Plan Review and Update Process Section Reviews and Updates The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team placed an emphasis on public participation for the update of the Hazard Mitigation Plan, discussing strategies to enhance participation opportunities at the first Section 3: Public local committee meeting. During plan development, the plan was Participation discussed at two public meetings hosted by the Hazard Mitigation Team and the Planning Board. The plan was also available on the City’s website for public comment. See Public Comments for feedback. MAPC gathered the most recently available climate, hazard and land use data and met with city staff to identify changes in local hazard areas and development trends. City staff reviewed critical infrastructure Section 4: Risk with MAPC staff in order to create an up-to-date list. The Risk Assessment Assessment integrates projected climate impacts. MAPC also used the most recently available version of HAZUS and assessed the potential impacts of flooding using the latest data. The Hazard Mitigation Goals were reviewed and endorsed by the Section 5: Goals Woburn Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team. Section 6: Existing The list of existing mitigation measures was updated to reflect current Mitigation Measures mitigation activities in the city. Mitigation measures from the 2016 plan were reviewed and assessed as to whether they were completed, in progress, or deferred. The Local Sections 7 and 8: Hazard Mitigation Planning Team determined whether to carry forward Hazard Mitigation measures into the 2021 Plan Update or modify or delete them. The Strategy Plan Update's hazard mitigation strategy reflects both new measures and measures carried forward from the 2016 plan.

        "Mitigation Team prioritized all of these measures based on current conditions. This section of the plan was updated with a new on-going plan Section 9: Plan implementation review and five-year update process that will assist the Adoption & City in incorporating hazard mitigation issues into other City planning Maintenance and regulatory review processes and better prepare the City for the next comprehensive plan update. As indicated in Table 34, Woburn made good progress implementing mitigation measures identified in the 2016 Hazard Mitigation Plan. Considerable work has been done to address drainage problems citywide. Three drainage projects were completed, and progress was made to reduce flooding on four additional projects. Progress was also made on stream, culvert and catch basin maintenance. A number of projects that were partially completed or not initiated have been continued into this plan update. The city also did outreach regarding heat risks and evaluated snow loads for some of its buildings. Overall, fifteen mitigation measures from the 2016 plan will be continued in the plan update. Most retain the same priority in this 2021 Update. Moving forward into the next five-year plan implementation period there will be many more opportunities to incorporate hazard mitigation into the City’s decision-making processes. As in the past, the city will document any actions taken within this iteration of the Hazard Mitigation Plan on challenges met and actions successfully adopted as part of the ongoing plan maintenance to be conducted by the Woburn Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team, as described in Section 9 Plan Adoption and Maintenance.

        "SECTION 2: INTRODUCTION PLANNING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FEDERAL DISASTER MITIGATION ACT The Federal Disaster Mitigation Act, passed in 2000, requires that after November 1, 2004, all municipalities that wish to continue to be eligible to receive FEMA funding for hazard mitigation grants, must adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan and update this plan in five-year intervals. This planning requirement does not affect disaster assistance funding. Federal hazard mitigation planning and grant programs are administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in collaboration with the states. These programs are administered in Massachusetts by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) in partnership with the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). The City of Woburn contracted with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), to assist the City in updating its third local Hazard Mitigation Plan, which was first adopted in 2007 as a multijurisdictional plan and updated as a single municipality plan in 2016. WHAT IS A HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN? Natural hazard mitigation planning is the process of determining how to systematically reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property damage resulting from natural hazards such as floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Hazard mitigation means to permanently reduce or alleviate the losses of life, injuries, and property resulting from natural hazards through long-term strategies. These long-term strategies include planning, policy changes, programs, projects, and other activities. This plan incorporates consideration of future risks due to projections for the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather fueled by a warming planet. PREVIOUS FEDERAL/STATE DISASTERS Since 1991, there have been 24 natural hazard events that triggered federal or state disaster declarations that included Middlesex County. These are listed in Table 2 below. The majority of these events involved flooding, while others were due to hurricanes or nor’easters, and severe winter weather.

COMMUNITY PROFILE The City of Woburn occupies 13.1 miles of the Fells Upland and is a suburban industrial city located along the upper Mystic Valley. Incorporated in 1642, Woburn became an early manufacturing center, tanning leather and making shoes. Production was large enough so that during the King Philip's Wars, town taxes were partially paid in shoes. The smallpox epidemic of 1675 cut deeply into the town's population. The Middlesex Canal from Boston opened in 1803 and the Boston and Lowell Railroad in 1835. Woburn continued to make boots and shoes and in 1855 made $280,000 in footwear, but by 1865 there had been a shift away from manufacturing shoes and toward the production of leather. In that year alone, the tanneries of Woburn shipped $1.7 million of leather and Woburn was at the head of the tanning industry in the country. Immigrants from Ireland and Canada moved to Woburn to take the jobs in the tanneries and in 1884, 26 large tanneries employed 1500 men producing $4.5 million worth of leather. Henry Thayer of Woburn originated chrome tanning, which took the place of bark tanning in 1901. The tan yards clearly supplemented the city's subsistence farming from the earliest settlement times. By 1915 there was some diversification in the city's economy and residents were making ice cream, machine tools, mops, and paper boxes among other things. Woburn developed as an early English town settlement and has a notable early burying ground. Suburban growth began in the mid-19th century and has continued. Completion of Routes 128 and 93 established Woburn as a suburban economic hub. (Narrative based on information provided by the Massachusetts Historic Commission).

The community is certified by the state as a Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness community. • Records from flooding in 2010 highlight that significant flood damage occurred throughout the city, with 100% of disaster flood claims located outside the FEMA 1% chance flood zone. • Woburn is located in the Mystic River watershed. Woburn collaborates with neighboring towns and the Mystic River Watershed Association to reduce stormwater impacts. • Flooding occurs in multiple locations along the Aberjona River. • Drought has negative impacts on trees, vegetation, and waterways. Drought also has economic impacts as the city must rely on more expensive water from the MWRA for part of its water supply. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 13 of 114",
        "SECTION 3: PLANNING PROCESS & PUBLIC PARTICIPATION MAPC employs a six-step planning process based on FEMA’s hazard mitigation planning guidance focusing on local needs and priorities but maintaining a regional perspective matched to the scale and nature of natural hazard events and regional climate change. Public participation is a central component of this process, providing critical information about the local occurrence of hazards while also serving as a means to build a base of support for hazard mitigation activities. MAPC supports participation by the general public and other plan stakeholders through two public meetings, posting of the plan to the City’s website, and invitations sent to neighboring communities, city boards and commissions, and other local or regional entities to review the plan and provide comment. PLANNING PROCESS SUMMARY The six-step planning process outlined below is based on the guidance provided by FEMA’s Local Multi-Hazard Mitigation Planning Guidance. Public participation is a central element of this process, which attempts to focus on local problem areas and identify needed mitigation measures based on where gaps occur in the existing mitigation efforts of the municipality. In plan updates, the process described below allows staff to bring the most recent hazard information into the plan, including new hazard occurrence data, changes to a municipality’s existing mitigation measures, and progress made on actions identified in previous plans. Figure 1: Six-Step Planning Process 1. Map the Hazards – MAPC relies on data from a number of different federal, state, and local sources in order to map the areas with the potential to experience natural hazards. This mapping represents a multi-hazard assessment of the municipality and is used as a set of base maps for the remainder of the planning process. A particularly important source CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 14 of 114",
        "of information is the knowledge drawn from local municipal staff on where natural hazard impacts have occurred. These maps can be found in Appendix B. 2. Assess the Risks & Potential Damages – Working with local staff, critical facilities, infrastructure, vulnerable populations, and other features are mapped and contrasted with the hazard data from the first step to identify those that might represent particular vulnerabilities to these hazards. Land use data and development trends are also incorporated into this analysis. In addition, MAPC develops estimates of the potential impacts of certain hazard events on the community. MAPC drew on the following resources to complete the plan: • City of Woburn Zoning Ordinances • City of Woburn Community Resilience Building Workshop Summary of Findings 2019 • Woburn Housing Production Plan • Blue Hill Observatory • Boston HIRA • FEMA, Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Norfolk County, MA, 2012 • FEMA, Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazard • FEMA, Local Mitigation Plan Review Guide, October 2011 • Fourth National Climate Assessment, 2018 • Massachusetts Flood Hazard Management Program • Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management Shoreline Change Data • Massachusetts Office of Dam Safety, Inventory of Massachusetts Dams 2018 • Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation Plan, 2013 • Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan, 2018 • Metropolitan Area Planning Council, GIS Lab, Regional Plans and Data • National Weather Service • Nevada Seismological Library • New England Seismic Network, Boston College Weston Observatory, http://aki.bc.edu/index.htm • NOAA National Climatic Data Center, http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ • Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center • Northeast States Emergency Consortium, http://www.nesec.org/ • Tornado History Project • US Census, 2010 and American Community Survey 2017 5-Year Estimates • USGS, National Water Information System, http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis 3. Review Existing Mitigation – Municipalities in the Boston Metropolitan Region have an active history in hazard mitigation as most have adopted flood plain zoning districts, wetlands protection programs, and other measures as well as enforcing the State building code, which has strong provisions related to hazard resistant building requirements. Many communities have started adopting regulations designed to promote climate resilience. All current municipal mitigation measures must be documented. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 15 of 114",
        "4. Develop Mitigation Strategies – MAPC works with the local municipal staff to identify new mitigation measures, utilizing information gathered from the hazard identification, vulnerability assessments, and the community’s existing mitigation efforts to determine where additional work is necessary to reduce the potential damages from hazard events. Additional information on the development of hazard mitigation strategies can be found in Section 7. 5. Plan Approval & Adoption – Once a final draft of the plan is complete it is sent to MEMA for the state level review and, following that, to FEMA for approval. Typically, once FEMA has approved the plan the agency issues a conditional approval (Approval Pending Adoption), with the condition being adoption of the plan by the municipality. More information on plan adoption can be found in Section 9 and documentation of plan adoption can be found in Appendix D. 6. Implement & Update the Plan – Implementation is the final and most important part of any planning process. Hazard Mitigation Plans must also be updated on a five-year basis making preparation for the next plan update an important on-going activity. Section 9 includes more detailed information on plan implementation. 2016 PLAN IMPLEMENTATION & MAINTENANCE The 2016 City of Woburn Hazard Mitigation Plan contained a risk assessment of identified hazards for the city and mitigation measures to address the risk and vulnerability from these hazards. Since approval of the plan by FEMA and local adoption progress has been made on implementation of the measures. The city has advanced a number of projects for implementation, including multiple drainage projects. In addition, the city completed a climate resilience planning program and has been certified by the state in the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness program. THE LOCAL MULTIPLE HAZARD COMMUNITY PLANNING TEAM MAPC worked with the local community representatives to organize a Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team for Woburn. MAPC briefed the local representatives as to the desired composition of that team as well as the need for public participation in the local planning process. The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team is central to the planning process as it is the primary body tasked with developing a mitigation strategy for the community. The local team was tasked with working with MAPC to set plan goals, provide information on the hazards that impact the city, existing mitigation measures, and helping to develop new mitigation measures for this plan update. The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team membership is listed below. Tina Cassidy Planning Board Director, Project Manager Jay Duran Superintendent of Public Works John E.

Feedback was assured through the participation of the Conservation Administrator and Planning Board Director. In addition, MAPC, the State-designated regional planning authority for Woburn, works with all agencies that that regulate development in the region, including the listed municipal entities and state agencies, such as the Department of Transportation. The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team met on the following dates: March 16, 2021, April 22, 2021, and July 13, 2021. The purpose of the meetings was to introduce the Hazard Mitigation planning program, consider climate impacts, review, and update hazard mitigation goals, and to gather information on local hazard mitigation issues and sites or areas related to these. Later meetings focused on verifying information gathered by MAPC staff and discussion of existing mitigation practices, the status of mitigation measures identified in the 2016 hazard mitigation plan, and potential new or revised mitigation measures. The agendas for these meetings are included in Appendix A. PUBLIC MEETINGS Public participation in the hazard mitigation planning process is important, both for plan development and for later implementation of the plan. Residents, business owners, and other community members are an excellent source for information on the historic and potential impacts of natural hazard events and particular vulnerabilities the community may face from these hazards. Their participation in this planning process also builds understanding of the concept of hazard mitigation and climate impacts, potentially creating support for mitigation actions taken in the future to implement the plan. To gather this information and educate residents on hazard mitigation, the city hosted two public meetings, one during the planning process and one after a complete draft plan was available for review. The public had an opportunity to provide input to the Woburn hazard mitigation planning process during a public meeting held on June 3, 2021 and hosted on Zoom. The draft plan update was presented at a Planning Board meeting held on July 27, 2021 and hosted on Zoom. Both meetings were publicized in accordance with the Massachusetts Public Meeting Law.

PUBLIC COMMENT At the first public meeting a commenter provided mapping and photos of specific flooding areas of concern. These include Olympia Avenue, Washington Street, and Henshaw Avenue near the I- 93 exchange. In each location flooding is associated with the Aberjona River. Another commenter expressed support for strategies that would establish residential water use restrictions to address drought concerns. Another commenter expressed interest in strategies that would support residents who may be more impacted by, or vulnerable to, natural hazards. After the second meeting a commenter expressed appreciation for inclusion of flooding areas identified in the first public meeting, and reiterated concern about Olympia Avenue and Henshaw Street flooding. These locations have been added to Table 8: Locally Identified Areas of Flooding and to the maps in Appendix B.

        "SECTION 4: RISK ASSESSMENT The risk assessment analyzes the potential natural hazards that could occur within the City of Woburn as well as the relationship between those hazards and current land uses, potential future development, and critical infrastructure. This section also includes a vulnerability assessment that estimates the potential damages that could result from certain large-scale natural hazard events. In order to update Woburn’s risk assessment, MAPC gathered the most recently available hazard and land use data and met with City staff to identify changes in local hazard areas and development trends. MAPC also used FEMA’s damage estimation software, HAZUS. With the adoption of the Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan 2018 (SHMCAP), Massachusetts became the first state to integrate climate projections in a state hazard mitigation plan. Following the state model, the projected impacts of our warming climate on natural hazards are integrated throughout the risk assessment. Key impacts include rising temperatures, which in turn affect precipitation patterns, sea level, and extreme weather. “Global climate is changing rapidly compared to the pace of natural variations in climate that have occurred throughout Earth’s history. Global average temperature has increased by about 1.8°F from 1901 to 2016, and observational evidence does not support any credible natural explanations for this amount of warming; instead, the evidence consistently points to human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse or heat-trapping gases, as the dominant cause.” Fourth National Climate Assessment, 2018 (Chapter 2-1) CLIMATE CHANGE OBSERVATIONS AND PROJECTIONS Climate change observations come from a variety of data sources that have measured and recorded changes in recent decades and centuries. Climate change projections, however, predict future climate impacts and, by their nature, cannot be observed or measured. As a result of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future conditions, climate projections are generally expressed as a range of possible impacts. Temperature Our climate has always been regulated by gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, that blanket the earth. These gases trap heat that would otherwise be reflected out to space; without them our planet would be too cold to support life. We refer to these gases as “greenhouse gases” (GHGs) for their heat trapping capacity. The combustion of fossil fuels, our primary energy source in the age of industrialization, releases GHGs into the atmosphere. In the past century, human activity associated with industrialization has contributed to a growing concentration of GHGs in our atmosphere. Records from the Blue Hill Observatory in Milton, MA show that average temperatures (30-year mean) have risen approximately 3 degrees (F) in the almost 200 years since record keeping began in 1831.

Moreover, there has been a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of large rain events. For the Northeast US, according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment 2018, in the past sixty years there has been a 55% increase in the amount of annual precipitation that falls in the top 1% of storm events (Figure 4). Changes in precipitation are fueled by warming temperatures which increase evaporation and, therefore, the amount of water vapor in the air. Total annual precipitation in Massachusetts is projected to increase by 1 to 6 inches by mid- century, and by 1.2 to 7.3 inches by the end of this century (SHMCAP p. 2-22). The Fourth National Climate Assessment predicts that the pattern of increasing frequency and intensity of extreme rain events will continue. By 2070 to 2099, (relative to 1986 to 2015) they project a 30-40% increase in total annual precipitation falling in the heaviest 1% of rain events (Figure 5).

Warming temperatures contribute to sea level rise in two ways. First, warm water expands to take up more space. Second, rising temperatures are melting land-based ice which enters the oceans as melt water. A third, quite minor, contributor to sea level rise in New England is not related to climate change. New England is still experiencing a small amount of land subsidence (drop in elevation) in response to the last glacial period.

        "CHANGING PRECIPITATION PATTERNS INLAND FLOODING Inland flooding is generally caused by hurricanes, nor’easters, severe rainstorms, and thunderstorms. Northeasters can occur at any time of the year, but they are most common in winter. Hurricanes are most common in the summer and early fall. Large rain storms can occur year-round. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time due to increasing extreme rainfall events. Increase in average annual rainfall may also lead to more incidents of basement flooding caused by high seasonal groundwater levels. Flooding was the most prevalent serious natural hazard identified by local officials in Woburn. Inland flooding can be associated with overflowing rivers and streams, stormwater flooding associated with impervious surfaces and stormwater infrastructure, and in more rare cases ice jams, ground failures (erosion), and in some communities beaver dams. Woburn is subject to two kinds of flooding: inland/riverine flooding where the rate of precipitation and/or amount of stormwater runoff overwhelms the capacity of natural or structured drainage systems causing overflow and urban flooding in which precipitation causes the water table to rise and leads to flooding of low-lying areas such as streets and underpasses. These types of flooding are often combined as storm events lead to large amounts of draining stormwater. Woburn is located in the Mystic River Watershed. The watershed partially or wholly encompasses 22 communities north and west of Boston. Its headwaters begin in Reading and form the Aberjona River which flows through Woburn and Winchester and into the upper Mystic Lake. From the lower Mystic Lake, the Mystic River flows through Arlington, Somerville, Medford, Everett, Chelsea, Charlestown, and East Boston before discharging to Boston Harbor. The March 2010 rainstorms fit the profile of a type of event expected to increase in frequency as the climate warms. That is, significant precipitation, falling in late winter as rain rather than snow, on ground saturated with snow melt, and while vegetation is still dormant. The Blue Hill Observatory in Milton recorded 17.7 inches of rain from three storms in the 19 days from March 13 to 31. As shown at the USGS gage located on the Aberjona River downstream from Horn Pond in Winchester the river surged, recording the third highest discharge on March 15, 2010, dating back to 1940 (Figure 8). The March 2010 storms were a federally declared disaster making federal assistance available to residents who did not carry flood insurance. Based on the claims, Woburn experienced extensive flood damage, with eight flood insurance claims and 390 disaster claims, 99% of which were located outside of FEMA Special Flood Hazard Areas. Some of the claims are in the vicinity of Woburn’s streams and wetlands, but many are not associated with waterways or wetlands. This is not unusual in urbanized areas. See Map 3 in Appendix B for claim locations. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 28 of 114",

Flooding may also occur when ice jams break up and ice may pile up at culverts or around bridges. There is no known history of ice jams leading to flooding in Woburn and City staff did not identify this hazard as an issue for the city. DAM FAILURE OR OVERTOPPING Dams can fail because of structural problems or age, independent of any storm event. Earthquakes can be a cause of dam failure by causing structural damage. Dams can also fail structurally because of flooding arising from a storm, or they can overspill due to flooding. In the event of a dam failure, the energy of the water stored behind even a small dam can cause loss of life and property damage if there are people or buildings downstream. The number of fatalities from a dam failure depends on the amount of warning provided to the population and the number of people in the path of the dam’s floodwaters. A concern for dams in Massachusetts is that many were built in the 19th century without the benefits of modern engineering or construction oversight. In addition, some dams have not been properly maintained. The increasing intensity of precipitation is the primary climate concern related to dams, as they were most likely designed based on historic weather patterns. The SHMCAP indicates that changing precipitation patterns may increase the likelihood of overflow events. Dam failure is a highly infrequent occurrence, but a severe incident could result in loss of lives and significant property damage. According to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, three dams have failed in Massachusetts since 1984, one of which resulted in a death. Horn Pond Dam (aka Scalley Dam): Horn Pond covers approximately 120 acres and has a watershed area of 10 square miles. The primary outlet control structure is controlled by a weir and a slide gate with a secondary emergency riprap spillway that handles elevated water levels. The spillway is located on the southerly side of Horn Pond and enters Horn Pond Brook which flows through the Town of Winchester. In severe weather events and in anticipation of a rainfall of 4 inches or greater, the city notifies the downstream cities and towns that they will be lowering the pond to increase storm water runoff storage. When the capacity exceeds the storage volume, the pond begins to crest at elevation 42.0 (NGVD29) thus creating flooding of the local roadway and impacting the residences and apartments that directly abut Horn Pond Brook. Since the 2016 plan, the outlet structure has been modified to improve the ability to manage flood events. Horn Pond Dam is classified by the State Office of Dam Safety as being a significant hazard dam. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 31 of 114",

        "DROUGHT Drought is a temporary irregularity in precipitation and differs from aridity since the latter is restricted to low rainfall regions and is a permanent feature of climate. Drought is a period characterized by long durations of below normal precipitation. Drought conditions occur in virtually all climatic zones, yet its characteristics vary significantly from one region to another since it is relative to the normal precipitation in that region. Drought can affect agriculture, water supply, aquatic ecology, wildlife, and plant life. Droughts are projected to increase in frequency and intensity in the summer and fall as weather patterns change. Factors contributing to this include increasing evaporation as a result of warmer weather, earlier snow melt, and more extreme weather patterns. Drought impacts can include reduced groundwater and surface water levels, affecting water quality and quantity, and the organisms that rely on aquatic resources. Drought also increases stress on plant communities and, the likelihood of forest and brush fires. Communities may be affected by water use restrictions, affecting drinking water supply and outdoor water use. Economic sectors impacted could include recreation, agriculture, and forestry. Five levels of drought have been developed to characterize drought severity: Normal, Advisory, Watch, Warning, and Emergency. These drought levels are based on the conditions of natural resources and are intended to provide information on the current status of water resources. The levels provide a basic framework from which to take actions to assess, communicate, and respond to drought conditions. Woburn does not collect data relative to drought events. Because drought tends to be a regional natural hazard, this plan references state data as the best available data for drought. Drought is a city-wide hazard in Woburn. The SHMCAP using data collected since 1850, calculates that statewide there is a 1% chance of being in a drought emergency in any given month. For drought warning and watch levels, the chance is 2% and 8% respectively in any given month (Table 10). Table 10: Frequency of Massachusetts Drought Levels Probability of Occurrence in a Drought Level Frequency Since 1850 Given Month Drought Emergency 5 occurrences 1% chance Drought Warning 5 occurrences 2% chance Drought Watch 46 occurrences 8% chance Source: SHMCAP Drought emergencies have been reached infrequently, with five events occurring between 1850 and 2012: 1883, 1911, 1941, 1957, and 1965 to 1966. Due to its long duration, the drought from 1965 to 1966 is viewed as the most severe drought to have occurred in Massachusetts in modern times. The drought that extended from July 2016 to April 2017 reached the Drought Warning level. Determinations regarding the end of a drought or reduction of the drought level CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 34 of 114",
        "focus on two key drought indicators: precipitation and groundwater levels. These two factors have the greatest long-term impact on stream flow, water supply, reservoir levels, soil moisture, and the potential for forest fires. The U.S. Drought Monitor characterizes droughts as moderate, severe, extreme, or exceptional. Severe drought is characterized by likely crop and pasture losses, water shortages, and water restrictions. As shown in Figure 9 below, Woburn experienced between 37 and 49 weeks of severe drought between 2001 and 2017. A concern for Woburn is the impact of drought on Woburn’s water supply. In addition to impacting natural resources, drought causes Woburn to rely on the Metropolitan Water Resources Authority, a more expensive source, to augment city water supply. Figure 9: Weeks of Severe Drought (2001-2017) Source: SHMCAP LANDSLIDES According to the U.S. Geological Survey, “The term landslide includes a wide range of ground movement, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes, and shallow debris flows. Although gravity acting on an over steepened slope is the primary reason for a landslide, there are other contributing factors.” Among the contributing factors are, erosion by rivers or ocean waves over steepened slopes; rock and soil slopes weakened through saturation by snowmelt or heavy rains; earthquake created stresses that make weak slopes fail; excess weight from accumulation of rain or snow; and stockpiling of rock or ore from waste piles or man-made structures. In Massachusetts, according to the SHMCAP, the most common cause of landslides are geologic conditions combined CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 35 of 114",
        "with steep slopes and/or heavy rains. Landslides associated with heavy rains typically occur on steep slopes with permeable soils underlain by till or bedrock. Landslides can result from human activities that destabilize an area or can occur as a secondary impact from another natural hazard, such as flooding. In addition to structural damage to buildings and the blockage of transportation corridors, landslides can lead to sedimentation of water bodies. Typically, a landslide occurs when the condition of a slope changes from stable to unstable. Natural precipitation such as heavy snow accumulation, torrential rain, and run-off may saturate soil, creating instability enough to contribute to a landslide. More frequent extreme rain events may increase the chance of landslides as saturated soils are conducive to landslides. Drought may also increase the likelihood of landslides if loss of vegetation decreases soil stability. The SHMCAP, utilizing data from the MA Department of Transportation from 1986 to 2006 to estimates that, on average, roughly one to three known landslides have occurred each year. A slope stability map published by the MA Geological Survey and UMass-Amherst indicates that the most significant risk of landslide is in western Massachusetts. According to the SHMCAP, factors that influence landslide severity include soil properties, topographic position and slope, and historical incidence. Woburn is classified as having low susceptibility and a low incidence of landslides (see Map 4, Appendix B). Should a landslide occur in the future, the type and degree of impacts would be highly localized. The city’s vulnerabilities could include damage to structures, damage to transportation and other infrastructure, and localized road closures. Injuries and casualties, while possible, would be unlikely given the low extent and impact of landslides in Woburn. The Building Inspector reports that there have been three small landslides in the last decade. Each was associated with former quarries and caused minor damage on private property. RISING TEMPERATURES AVERAGE AND EXTREME TEMPERATURES Extreme temperatures occur when either high temperature or low temperatures relative to average local temperatures occur. These can occur for brief periods of time and be acute, or they can occur over long periods of time where there is a long stretch of excessively hot or cold weather. Woburn has four well-defined seasons. The seasons have several defining factors, with temperature one of the most significant. Extreme temperatures can be defined as those that are far outside of the normal seasonal ranges for Massachusetts. EXTREME COLD The severity of extreme cold temperature is typically measured using the Wind Chill Temperature Index, which is provided by the National Weather Service (NWS). The wind chill is the apparent temperature felt on exposed skin due to the combination of air temperature and wind speed. The index is provided in Figure 11 below. A Wind Chill warning is issued when the Wind Chill Index is forecast to fall below -25 degrees F for at least 3 hours. Extreme cold is a dangerous situation CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 36 of 114",
        "that can result in health emergencies for susceptible people, such as those without shelter, those who are stranded, or those who live in homes that are poorly insulated or without heat. Figure 10 Wind Chill Temperature Index and Frostbite Risk Source: National Weather Service The City of Woburn does not collect data for previous occurrences of extreme cold. The best available local data are for Middlesex County, through the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). There have been three extreme cold events in the past eleven years, which caused no deaths, no injuries, or property damage. This is an average of one event every 3.5 years. Extreme cold is a city-wide hazard for Woburn.

Another measure used for identifying extreme heat events relies on the Heat Index. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the Heat Index is a measure of how hot it really feels relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature. The NWS issues an advisory when the heat CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 37 of 114",

Figure 11: Heat Index Chart The City of Woburn does not collect data on excessive heat occurrences. The best available local data are for Middlesex County, through the National Climatic Data Center. In the past eleven years there has been one excessive heat day and no deaths, injuries, or property damage (see Table 12). This is an average of one extreme heat occurrence every 11 years. Table 12: Middlesex County Extreme Heat Occurrences 2010 through 2020 Date Deaths Injuries Damage 7/6/2010 0 0 0 Source: NOAA, National Climatic Data Center Extreme cold events are predicted to decrease in the future, while extreme heat days, as well as average temperatures are projected to increase. The projected increase in extreme heat and heat waves is the source of one of the key health concerns related to climate change. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can cause heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and death. Heat exhaustion is the most common heat-related illness and if untreated, it may progress to heat stroke. People who perform manual labor, particularly those who work outdoors, are at increased risk for heat-related illnesses. Prolonged heat exposure and the poor air quality and high humidity that often accompany heat waves can also exacerbate pre-existing conditions, including respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease, and mental illnesses. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 38 of 114",
        "Older adults are often at elevated risk due to a high prevalence of pre-existing and chronic conditions. People who live in older housing stock and in housing without air conditioning have increased vulnerability to heat-related illnesses. Power failures are more likely to occur during heat waves, affecting the ability of residents to remain cool during extreme heat. Individuals with pre-existing conditions and those who require electric medical equipment may be at increased risk during a power outage. Due to what is termed the “heat island effect”, areas with less shade and more dark surfaces (pavement and roofs) will experience even hotter temperatures; these surfaces absorb heat during the day and release it in the evening, keeping nighttime temperatures warmer as well. Map 10 in Appendix B displays areas that are among the hottest 5% of land in the MAPC region based on land surface temperature derived from satellite imagery on July 13, 2016, when the high temperature at Logan Airport was 92°F. There are areas of Woburn that have significant heat islands including west of Route 93 and along Main Street (see Map 9). It is also worth noting that heat impacts are more likely to be felt by residents without air conditioning, by those who work outdoors, and those with underlying health conditions. Average temperatures in Massachusetts are projected to increase by 3.8 to 10.8 degrees by the end of the century (SHMCAP). Over time our climate will become more similar to areas south of New England. Impacts on natural resources include a longer growing season and northern migration of plants and animals, including invasive species. The SHMCAP identifies ecosystems that are expected to be particularly vulnerable to warming temperatures. These include coldwater fisheries, vernal pools, spruce-fir forests, northern hardwood forests (Maple, Beach, Birch), Hemlock forests, and urban forests (due to heat island impacts). WILDFIRE A wildfire is a non-structure fire occurring in a forested, shrub or grassland areas. In the Boston Metro region these fires rarely grow to the size of a wildfire, as seen more typically in the western U.S. A more likely occurrence is brush fires that typically burn no more than the underbrush of a forested area. There are three different classes of wildfires: • Surface fires are the most common type and burn along the floor of a forest, moving slowly and killing or damaging trees. • Ground fires are usually started by lightning and burn on or below the forest floor. • Crown fires spread rapidly by wind, jumping along the tops of trees. A wildfire differs greatly from other fires by its extensive size, the speed at which it can spread out from its original source, its potential to unexpectedly change direction, and its ability to jump gaps such as roads, rivers, and fire breaks. Wildfire season can begin in March and usually ends in late November. The majority of wildfires typically occur in April and May, when most vegetation is void of any appreciable moisture, making them highly flammable. Once \"green-up\" takes place in late May to early June, the fire danger usually is reduced somewhat. As the CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 39 of 114",
        "climate warms, drought and warmer temperatures may increase the risk of wildfire as vegetation dries out and becomes more flammable. The National Wildfire Coordinating Group classifies the severity of wildfires based on their acreage. Fires can present a hazard where there is the potential to spread into developed or inhabited areas, particularly residential areas where sufficient fuel materials might exist to allow the fire the spread into homes. Protecting structures from fire poses special problems and can stretch firefighting resources to the limit. If heavy rains follow a fire, other natural disasters can occur, including landslides, mudflows, and floods. If the wild fire destroys the ground cover, then erosion becomes one of several potential problems. POTENTIAL BRUSHFIRE HAZARD AREAS The SCHMCAP includes a graphic that depicts statewide fire risk incorporating three risk components: fuel, wildland-urban interface, and topography (Figure 12). The wildland-urban interface reflects communities where housing and vegetation intermingle, and fire can spread from structures to vegetated areas. The most susceptible fuels are pitch pine, scrub oak and oak forests. Topography can affect the behavior of fires, as fire spreads more easily uphill. Woburn is shown in the no risk zone. Fire was not identified as a common occurrence, but one additional area of concern along railroad tracks was identified. The most common cause of wildfires is the careless disposal of smoking materials and untended campfires. The following areas of city were identified as having the highest potential for brush fires. The numbers correspond to the numbers on Map 8, “Hazard Areas”: Table 13: Locally Identified Areas of Brushfire Risk Map Name Description ID On the westerly side of Horn Pond and north of the Woburn Country Club golf course is an area where Adjacent to Horn numerous fires have occurred over the years. With many 10 Pond walking trails bisecting the area, fire hazards such as the carelessness with cigarettes and children playing with matches are of great concern. Adjacent to Cabot Road and along the railroad tracks 12 Cabot Road there is the potential for brushfires. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 40 of 114",
        "Figure 12: Wildfire Risk Areas Source: SHMCAP While there are areas of fire risk, city officials indicate that significant brush fires are not a common occurrence. INVASIVE SPECIES The 2018 SHMCAP includes invasive species as a natural hazard for the first time. They are defined as “non-native species that cause or are likely to cause harm to ecosystems, economies, and/or public health”. In new habitats invasive species displace native species if they have competitive advantages including that they are not subject to biological controls from their native habitat. Some of the more recognizable invasive plant species noted in the SHMCAP include Norway maple, garlic mustard, Japanese barberry, black swallowwort, buckthorn, purple loosestrife, water milfoil, Japanese knotweed, and phragmites. Invasive pests include gypsy moth, hemlock wooly adelgid, and the Asian long-horned beetle. Green crabs are a notable marine invasive. The Massachusetts Invasive Plant Advisory Group categorizes invasive severity as either limited prevalence in Massachusetts, partial containment potential, or public health threat. The City of Woburn is concerned with the presence of exotic and invasive species since they degrade natural vegetation and habitat and threaten native biodiversity. The presence of invasive species may cause a reduction in both plant and animal (wildlife) diversity. Natural vegetation can get choked out and this in turn causes a decline in the types and abundance of CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 41 of 114",
        "available food and shelter for wildlife. Removal of established invasive plants can require considerable effort; therefore prevention efforts are preferred. Since invasive species are often inadvertently introduced at disturbed sites, the City uses permitting to require development proponents (as appropriate) to submit an invasive species control plan which includes a description of invasive species present at the site and specifies methods for removal and control of invasive species, with required monitoring and written reporting with photographs of the areas of concern. Some invasive species known to be present in Woburn include: Japanese Knotweed, Oriental Bittersweet, Garlic Mustard, Common Reed, Common Buckthorn, Purple Loosestrife, Honeysuckle, Reed Canary-Grass, Tree of Heaven, Porcelain Berry, Spotted Knapweed, Parrot Feather, and Norway Maple. Canada Geese are also a concern, as are the Gypsy Moth, Hemlock Woody Adelgid, and the Emerald Ash Borer. We have had one reported possible sighting of the Asian Long-horned Beetle. EXTREME WEATHER HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS A hurricane is a violent wind and rainstorm with wind speeds of 74 to 200 miles per hour. A hurricane is strongest as it travels over the ocean and is particularly destructive to coastal property as the storm hits land. A tropical storm has similar characteristics, but wind speeds are between 34 and 73 miles per hour. Climate models suggest that hurricanes and tropical storms will become more intense as warmer ocean waters provide more fuel for the storms. In addition, rainfall amounts associated with hurricanes are predicted to increase because warmer air can hold more water vapor. Since 1900, 39 tropical storms have impacted New England (NESEC). Massachusetts has experienced approximately 32 tropical storms, nine Category 1 hurricanes, five Category 2 hurricanes and one Category 3 hurricane. Although uncommon, the City of Woburn’s entire area is vulnerable to hurricanes, which occur between June and November. As shown on Map 5 in Appendix B, a tropical storm tracked through Woburn in 1861. A hurricane or storm track is the line that delineates the path of the eye of a hurricane or tropical storm. The city also experiences the impacts of the wind and rain from hurricanes and tropical storms regardless of whether the storm track passed through the city. The hazard mapping indicates that the 100-year wind speed in Woburn is 110 miles per hour.

Falling trees and branches are a significant problem because they can result in power outages when they fall on power lines or block traffic and emergency routes. Hurricanes are a city-wide hazard in Woburn. Potential hurricane damages to Woburn have been estimated using HAZUS-MH. Total damages are estimated at $25 million for a Category 2 hurricane and $103 million for a Category 4 hurricane. Hurricanes and tropical storms are a rare event having passed directly through Woburn only once. SEVERE WINTER STORM/NOR’EASTER A northeast storm, known as a nor’easter, is typically a large counterclockwise wind circulation around a low-pressure center. Featuring strong northeasterly winds blowing in from the ocean over coastal areas, nor’easters are relatively common in the winter months in New England occurring one to two times a year. The storm radius of a nor’easter can be as much as 1,000 miles and these storms feature sustained winds of 10 to 40 mph with gusts of up to 70 mph. These storms are accompanied by heavy rain or snow, depending on temperatures. Many of the historic flood events identified in the previous section were precipitated by nor’easters, including the “Perfect Storm” event in 1991. More recently, blizzards in February 2013, January 2015, and in March 2018 were large nor’easters that caused significant snowfall amounts. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 43 of 114",
        "Woburn is vulnerable to both the wind and precipitation that accompany nor’easters. High winds can cause damage to structures, fallen trees, and downed power lines leading to power outages. Intense rainfall can overwhelm drainage systems causing localized flooding of rivers and streams as well as urban stormwater ponding and localized flooding. Fallen tree limbs as well as heavy snow accumulation and intense rainfall can impede local transportation corridors, and block access for emergency vehicles. Nor’easters are also a cause of coastal flooding. A blizzard is a winter snow storm with sustained or frequent wind gusts to 35 mph or more, accompanied by falling or blowing snow which reduces visibility to or below ¼ mile. These conditions must be the predominant condition over a three-hour period. Extremely cold temperatures are often associated with blizzard conditions but are not a formal part of the definition. The hazard related to the combination of snow, wind, and low visibility significantly increases when temperatures drop below 20 degrees. The Regional Snowfall Index (RSI) characterizes and ranks the severity of northeast snowstorms. RSI has five categories: Extreme, Crippling, Major, Significant, and Notable. RSI scores are a function of the area affected by the snowstorm, the amount of snow, and the number of people living in the path of the storm. The largest RSI values result from storms producing heavy snowfall over large areas that include major metropolitan centers. The RSI categories are summarized below: Table 16: Regional Snowfall Index Category RSI Value Description 1 1 – 3 Notable 2 3-6 Significant 3 6-10 Major 4 10-18 Crippling 5 18+ Extreme Source: SHMCAP The most significant winter storm in recent history was the “Blizzard of 1978,” which resulted in over three feet of snowfall and multiple day closures of roadways, businesses, and schools.

The majority of blizzards and ice storms in the region cause more inconvenience than they do serious property damage, injuries, or deaths. However, periodically, a storm will occur which is a true disaster, and necessitates intense large-scale emergency response. The impacts of winter storms are often related to the weight of snow and ice, which can cause roof collapses and also causes tree limbs to fall. This in turn can cause property damage and potential injuries. Power outages may also result from fallen trees and utility lines. Winter storms are a potential city-wide hazard in Woburn. Map 6 in Appendix A indicates that the average annual average snowfall in most of Woburn is between 48 and 72 inches. A number of public safety issues can arise during snow storms. Impassible streets are a challenge for emergency vehicles and affect residents and employers. Snow-covered sidewalks force people to walk in streets, which are already less safe due to snow, slush, puddles, and ice. Large piles of snow can also block sight lines for drivers, particularly at intersections. Refreezing of melting snow can cause dangerous roadway conditions. In addition, transit operations may be impacted, as they were in the 2015 blizzards which caused the closure of the MBTA system for one day and limited services on the commuter rail for several weeks. As with hurricanes, warmer ocean water and air will provide more fuel for winter storms. According to the SHMCAP it appears that Atlantic coast nor’easters are increasing in frequency and intensity. Further, the SHMCAP notes that research suggests that warmer weather in the Artic CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 45 of 114",

The City of Woburn does not keep local records of winter storms. Data for Middlesex County is the best available data to help understand previous occurrences and impacts of heavy snow events. According to National Climate Data Center (NCDC) records, from 2010 through 2020, Middlesex County experienced 19 heavy snowfall events, resulting in no injuries or deaths, and over a million dollars in property damage. Heavy snow is considered to be high frequency events based on past occurrences, as there have been 19 events in the past eleven years, for an average of almost 2 events each winter.

The conditions created by freezing rain can make driving particularly dangerous and emergency response more difficult. The weight of ice on tree branches can also lead to falling branches damaging electric lines. City-specific data for previous ice storm occurrences are not collected by the City of Woburn. The best available local data is for Middlesex County through the National Climatic Data Center. There were no ice storms in Middlesex County since 2010. Middlesex County did experience 27 hail events from 2010 through 2020. That is an average of 2.5 events each year.

These events are spawned by thunderstorms and occasionally by hurricanes and may occur singularly or in multiples. They develop when cool air overrides a layer of warm air, causing the warm air to rise rapidly. Most vortices remain suspended in the atmosphere. Should they touch down, they become a force of destruction. Some ingredients for tornado formation include: • Very strong winds in the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere • Clockwise turning of the wind with height (from southeast at the surface to west aloft) • Increasing wind speed with altitude in the lowest 10,000 feet of the atmosphere (i.e., 20 mph at the surface and 50 mph at 7,000 feet) • Very warm, moist air near the ground with unusually cooler air aloft • A forcing mechanism such as a cold front or leftover weather boundary from previous shower or thunderstorm activity CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 48 of 114",
        "Tornado damage severity is measured by the Enhanced Fujita scale, which is based on the amount of damage created. As of February 1, 2007, the National Weather Service began rating tornados using the Enhanced Fujita-scale (EF-scale), which allows surveyors to create more precise assessments of tornado severity. The EF-scale is summarized below: Table 21: Enhance Fujita Scale Source: SHMCAP 2018 The frequency of tornadoes in eastern Massachusetts is low; on average, there are six tornadoes that touchdown somewhere in the Northeast region every year. The strongest tornado in Massachusetts history was the Worcester Tornado in 1953 (NESEC). Recent tornado events in Massachusetts were in Springfield in 2011 and in Revere in 2014. The Springfield tornado caused significant damage and resulted in four deaths in June of 2011. The Revere tornado touched down in Chelsea just south of Route 16, moved north into Revere’s business district along Broadway, and ended near the intersection of Routes 1 and 60. The path was approximately two miles long and 3/8 mile wide, with wind speeds up to 120 miles per hour. Approximately 65 homes had substantial damages and 13 homes and businesses were rendered uninhabitable. Since 1950, there have been eighteen tornadoes in Middlesex County recorded by the Tornado History Project. None of the tornados impacted Woburn.

Evacuation of impacted areas may be required on short notice. Sheltering and mass feeding efforts may be required along with debris clearance, search and rescue, and emergency fire and medical services. Key routes may be blocked by downed trees and other debris, and widespread power outages are also typically associated with tornadoes. Although tornadoes are a potential city-wide hazard in Woburn, tornado impacts are relatively localized compared to severe storms and hurricanes. Damages from any tornado in Woburn would greatly depend on the track of the tornado. Based on the record of previous occurrences since 1950, Tornado events in Woburn are a low frequency event as there has been no tornado activity in Woburn. According to the SHMCAP, it is possible that severe thunderstorms which can include tornadoes may increase in frequency and intensity. However, scientists have less confidence in the models that seek to project future changes in tornado activity. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 50 of 114",
        "OTHER SEVERE WEATHER SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS While less severe than the other types of storms discussed, thunderstorms can lead to localized damage and represent a hazard risk for communities. A thunderstorm typically features lightning, strong winds, rain, and/or hail. Thunderstorms sometime give rise to tornados. On average, these storms are only around 15 miles in diameter and last for about 30 minutes. A severe thunderstorm can include winds of close to 60 mph and rain sufficient to produce flooding. The severity of thunderstorms ranges from commonplace and of short duration to intense storms that cause damage due to high winds, flooding, or lightning strikes. The best available data on previous occurrences of thunderstorms in Woburn is for is for Middlesex County through the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). For the years 2015 through 2020, NCDC records show 41 thunderstorm events in Middlesex County (Table 23). These storms resulted in a total of $1.6 million in property damage.

The city's vulnerability to severe thunderstorms is similar to that of nor'easters. High winds can cause falling trees and power outages, as well as obstruction of key routes and emergency access. Heavy precipitation may also cause localized flooding, both riverine and urban drainage related. Based on the record of previous occurrences, thunderstorms in Woburn are high frequency events as this hazard has occurred an average of seven times per year in the past six years. As noted previously, the intensity of rainfall events has increased significantly, and those trends are expected to continue. The SHMCAP does not specifically address whether climate will affect the intensity or frequency of thunderstorms. NON-CLIMATE INFLUENCED HAZARDS EARTHQUAKES Earthquakes are the sole natural hazard for which there is no established correlation with climate impacts. Damage in an earthquake stems from ground motion, surface faulting, and ground failure in which weak or unstable soils, such as those composed primarily of saturated sand or silts, liquefy. The effects of an earthquake are mitigated by distance and ground materials between the epicenter and a given location. An earthquake in New England affects a much wider area than a similar earthquake in California due to New England’s solid bedrock geology (NESEC).

The range of peak ground acceleration in Massachusetts is from 10 %g to 20 %g, with a 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years. Woburn is in the 16 %g to 18 %g range, making it a moderate to high area of earthquake risk within the state, although the state as a whole is considered to have a low risk of earthquakes compared to the rest of the country. There have been no recorded earthquake epicenters within Woburn. Although New England has not experienced a damaging earthquake since 1755, seismologists state that a serious earthquake occurrence is possible. There are five seismological faults in Massachusetts, but there is no discernible pattern of previous earthquakes along these fault lines. Earthquakes occur without warning and may be followed by aftershocks. The majority of older buildings and infrastructure were constructed without specific earthquake resistant design features.

        "Figure 13: State of Massachusetts Earthquake Probability Map Earthquakes are a hazard with multiple impacts beyond the obvious building collapse. Buildings may suffer structural damage which may or may not be readily apparent. Earthquakes can cause major damage to roadways, making emergency response difficult. Water lines and gas lines can break, causing flooding and fires. Another potential vulnerability is equipment within structures. For example, a hospital may be structurally engineered to withstand an earthquake, but if the equipment inside the building is not properly secured, the operations at the hospital could be severely impacted during an earthquake. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides. According the SHMCAP there is a 10-15% chance of a magnitude 5 earthquake in a given ten- year period. Earthquakes are a potential city-wide hazard in Woburn. Although new construction under the most recent building codes generally will be built to seismic standards, much of the development in the city pre-dates the most recent building code. Potential earthquake damages to Woburn have been estimated using HAZUS-MH. Total building damages are estimated at $756 million for a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and $6.9 billion for a 7.0 magnitude earthquake. Other potential impacts are detailed in Table 31.

Economic Elements Post-WWII development of Woburn was most influenced by the opening of Route 128 in 1951 and then I-93 in 1963. Woburn’s location at the crossroads of these two components of the regional highway system greatly influenced new industrial, commercial, and residential development beyond the historic City center. Access to the regional highway system has allowed commercial and industrial development to flourish. The major local roads providing north-south access are Main Street (Route 38), Cambridge Street (Route 3), and Washington Street. The major east-west routes are Lexington Street, Montvale Avenue and Salem Street. Most of these streets contain significant local retail nodes. __________________________________________________________________ NATURAL, CULTURAL, AND HISTORICAL RESOURCE AREAS The city has many historic sites including the First and Second Burial Grounds, the Baldwin Mansion, the Rumford House, the Battle Road Conservation Area, the 1790 House, the First Congregational Church, the Middlesex Canal, the Library, and the U.S. Post Office. Several of these properties are on the National Register of Historic Places. The city has 950 acres of publicly owned open space and recreation land. This represents 11% of the total acreage of the city. The largest of these areas is Horn Pond. Horn Pond is very popular for walking with a network of trails going around the pond.

        "DEVELOPMENT TRENDS Development trends throughout the metropolitan region are tracked by MAPC’s Development Database, which provides an inventory of new development over the last decade. The database tracks both completed developments and those currently under construction. In addition, the Planning Board Director provided data on projected finished since 2016. The database includes 11 completed projects. Where available we include several attributes of the new development, including site acreage, housing units, and commercial space. Six of the completed projects are housing projects, and five are commercial. The completed projects in Woburn include a total of 449 housing units and just over 500,000 square feet of commercial space (see Table 27).

        "VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT The purpose of the vulnerability assessment is to estimate the extent of potential damages from natural hazards of varying types and intensities. A vulnerability assessment and estimation of damages was performed for hurricanes, earthquakes, and flooding through the HAZUS-MH software. Introduction to HAZUS-MH HAZUS- MH (multiple-hazards) is a computer program developed by FEMA to estimate losses due to a variety of natural hazards. The following overview of HAZUS-MH is taken from the FEMA website. For more information on the HAZUS-MH software, go to https://www.fema.gov/hazus/ “HAZUS-MH is a nationally applicable standardized methodology and software program that contains models for estimating potential losses from earthquakes, floods, and hurricane winds. HAZUS-MH was developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under contract with the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). Loss estimates produced by HAZUS-MH are based on current scientific and engineering knowledge of the effects of hurricane winds, floods, and earthquakes. Estimating losses is essential to decision-making at all levels of government, providing a basis for developing and evaluating mitigation plans and policies as well as emergency preparedness, response, and recovery planning. HAZUS-MH uses state-of-the-art geographic information system (GIS) software to map and display hazard data and the results of damage and economic loss estimates for buildings and infrastructure. It also allows users to estimate the impacts of hurricane winds, floods and earthquakes on populations.” There are three modules included with the HAZUS-MH software: hurricane wind, flooding, and earthquakes. There are also three levels at which HAZUS-MH can be run. Level 1 uses national baseline data and is the quickest way to begin the risk assessment process. The analysis that follows was completed using Level 1 data. Level 1 relies upon default data on building types, utilities, transportation, etc. from national databases as well as census data. While the databases include a wealth of information on the City of Woburn, it does not capture all relevant information. In fact, the HAZUS training manual notes that the default data is “subject to a great deal of uncertainty.” However, for the purposes of this plan, the analysis is useful. This plan is attempting to generally indicate the possible extent of damages due to certain types of natural disasters and to allow for a comparison between different types of disasters. Therefore, this analysis should be considered to be a starting point for understanding potential damages from the hazards. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 65 of 114",
        "ESTIMATED DAMAGES FROM HURRICANES The HAZUS software was used to model potential damages to the community from a 100-year and 500-year hurricane event; storms that are 1% and 0.2% likely to happen in a given year, and roughly equivalent to a Category 2 and Category 4 hurricane. The damages caused by these hypothetical storms were modeled as if the storm track passed directly through the city, bringing the strongest winds and greatest damage potential. Though there are no recorded instances of a hurricane equivalent to a 500-year storm passing through Massachusetts, this model was included in order to present a reasonable “worst case scenario” that would help planners and emergency personnel evaluate the impacts of storms that might be more likely in the future, as we enter into a period of more intense and frequent storms.

People who may be more susceptible to negative health effects can include older adults, young children, pregnant women, people with disabilities, and people with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more likely to be physically vulnerable to the health impacts of extreme heat and poor air quality. Individuals with physical mobility constraints may need additional assistance with emergency response. Older adults are often at elevated risk due to a high prevalence of pre- existing and chronic conditions. People who live in substandard housing and in housing without air conditioning have increased vulnerability to heat-related illnesses. Black and Latino residents in Massachusetts are hospitalized for asthma at considerably higher rates than the population as whole, reflecting the reality that longstanding societal inequities can lead to differential health outcomes based on race and ethnicity. Low-income people are often more susceptible to financial shocks, which can occur after extreme weather, and which can impact financial security and the ability to secure safe shelter and meet medical needs. Social isolation can also influence vulnerability, as it limits access to critical information, municipal resources, and social support systems. In the absence of strong social support networks and translation services, people living alone and those with limited English language proficiency may experience social isolation. People of color and undocumented immigrants may also experience social isolation where there are historically strained or tenuous relationships with government officials and first responders. Certain occupations may also experience more severe impacts. People who work outdoors, or in unregulated temperatures, are at increased risk for heat-related illnesses. In developing mitigation measures Woburn will want to consider the needs of all of its residents. In Woburn 8% of residents are below the poverty level (4-person household earning less than $24,563) and 39% are low-income (4-person household earning less than $78,150) (American Community Survey). 4% of residents are limited English speaking, and 18% speak another CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 68 of 114",

        "SECTION 5: HAZARD MITIGATION GOALS The Woburn Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team reviewed and discussed the goals from the 2016 Hazard Mitigation Plan for the City of Woburn. All of the goals are considered critical for the city, and they are not listed in order of importance. Prior to the Hazard Mitigation Plan update process, the City of Woburn developed a Climate Change Vulnerability Analysis and Action Plan. The local team chose to incorporate climate considerations as noted in Goal 10. GOAL 1. Prevent and reduce the loss of life, injury and property damages resulting from all major natural hazards. GOAL 2. Identify and seek funding for measures to mitigate or eliminate each known significant flood hazard area. GOAL 3. Integrate hazard mitigation planning as an integral factor in all relevant municipal departments, committees, and boards. • Ensure that the Planning Department considers hazard mitigation in its review and permitting of new development. • Review zoning regulations to ensure that the ordinance incorporates all reasonable hazard mitigation provisions. • Ensure that all relevant municipal departments have the resources to continue to enforce codes and regulations related to hazard mitigation. GOAL 4. Prevent and reduce the damage to public infrastructure resulting from all hazards. • Begin to assess the vulnerability of municipal buildings and infrastructure to damage from an earthquake. • Maintain existing mitigation infrastructure in good condition. GOAL 5. Encourage the business community, major institutions, and non-profits to work with the City to develop, review and implement the hazard mitigation plan. GOAL 6. Work with surrounding communities, state, regional and federal agencies to ensure regional cooperation and solutions for hazards affecting multiple communities. • Continue to participate in the Mystic Region REPC and Region IV A (Board of Health). GOAL 7. Ensure that future development meets federal, state, and local standards for preventing and reducing the impacts of natural hazards. GOAL 8. Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures that can be undertaken by property-owners. • Provide information on hazard mitigation activities in the languages most frequently spoken in Woburn. GOAL 9. Take maximum advantage of resources from FEMA and MEMA to educate City staff and the public about hazard mitigation. GOAL 10. Consider the potential impacts of future climate change. Incorporate climate sustainability and resiliency in hazard mitigation planning. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 71 of 114",
        "SECTION 6: EXISTING MITIGATION MEASURES The existing protections in the City of Woburn are a combination of zoning, land use, and environmental regulations, infrastructure maintenance, and drainage infrastructure improvement projects. Infrastructure maintenance generally addresses localized drainage clogging problems, while large scale capacity problems may require pipe replacement or invert elevation modifications. These more expensive projects are subject to the capital budget process and lack of funding is one of the biggest obstacles to completion of some of these. The City's existing mitigation measures, which were in place prior to the original 2005 Plan, are listed by hazard type here and are summarized in Table 33 below. Many upgrades to existing measures are noted in the following sections. EXISTING MULTI-HAZARD MITIGATION MEASURES Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) –. The city has an up-to-date CEMP plan that meets the state’s requirements. Enforcement of the State Building Code – The Massachusetts State Building Code contains many detailed regulations regarding wind loads, earthquake resistant design, flood-proofing, and snow loads. Regional Emergency Planning Committee (REPC) – The Mystic REPC serves as the emergency planning committee for 19 cities and towns. The Mystic REPC’s 19 member cities and towns work together to develop plans to educate, communicate, and protect their communities in case of natural and man-made emergencies. The Massachusetts Public Health Emergency Preparedness Region 4A – Woburn is a member of Region 4A, one of 15 regions within Massachusetts and is comprised of 33 cities and towns throughout the metro west area, which together form the General Coalition (GC). EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR FLOOD-RELATED HAZARDS Woburn employs a number of practices to help minimize potential flooding and impacts from flooding, and to maintain existing drainage infrastructure. Existing city-wide mitigation measures include the following: National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) – Woburn participates in the NFIP with 43 policies in force as of the January 11, 2021. FEMA maintains a database on flood insurance policies and claims. This database can be found on the FEMA website at http://www.fema.gov/business/nfip/statistics/pcstat.shtm Flood insurance policies in force ( as of January 11, 2021) 43 Coverage amounts of flood insurance policies $16,059,500 CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE EXISTING MITIGATION MEASURES 72 of 114",

The City complies with the NFIP by enforcing floodplain regulations, maintaining up-to- date floodplain maps, and providing information to property owners and builders regarding floodplains and building requirements. City Storm Drain System- All streets are swept once a year at a minimum and usually twice a year. The main roads are generally swept three or four times with some roads being done more frequently. Catch basin cleaning is also done annually. The DPW has a preventative maintenance plan and if flash floods or other storm events are forecast, they have a list of culverts and catch basins that are checked and cleaned if necessary. The DPW has three pieces of equipment and does all of the work in-house. Maintenance of the water distribution system: The City is in its ninth year of a cleaning and relining program as well as replacing gates and valves. The exercise of valves and gates is done as part of the flushing program. In the past two years the DPW has been using an iPad to log in information as it undertakes this work. Zoning ordinance–The relevant section of the zoning ordinance is Section 9: Floodway and Flood Plain Districts. Subdivision regulations – The Woburn Planning Board’s Land Subdivision Rules and Regulations – 1998 Edition – contain standards for drainage on subdivisions. EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR DAM-RELATED HAZARDS DCR dam safety regulations apply to Scalley Dam at Horn Pond. Woburn is working with Winchester on improving dam operations. EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR WIND-RELATED HAZARDS CEMP: The CEMP addresses wind risks. Massachusetts State Building Code - The City has adopted the Massachusetts State Building Code. The Massachusetts State Building Code contains detailed regulations regarding wind loads. Tree trimming – Under the direction of the tree warden the city maintains public shade trees within the public right-of-way. When EverSource needs to remove or trim a shade tree they will call and meet the Tree Warden on site before any work is done. EverSource also sends a plan 1 year in advance before any major work is done. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE EXISTING MITIGATION MEASURES 73 of 114",
        "EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR WINTER-RELATED HAZARDS Building Code – The Building Code addresses snow loads. Snow Removal – The City utilizes two areas for snow disposal. One is the ball field at the Veterans School off of School Street and the other is a smaller, satellite area at Saint Anthony’s Church on Main Street. The city does not dump snow into Horn Pond because it is the City’s water supply. Road treatment -The City uses a combination of sand and salt to treat the roads during the winter. The city is careful to minimize the use of sand and salt on Arlington Road because of its proximity to the water supply at Horn Pond. The city also minimizes the use of salt on roads adjacent to wetlands. Salt is used primarily when there is a hilly road where safety takes precedence. Due to environmental concerns and economics, the trend in snow and ice control has been to reduce the volume of sand that is mixed with salt. The DPW has phased out the use of sand. There has also been a concerted effort to reduce the volume of salt used during storms by supplementing the application of salt with chemical enhancements such as calcium chloride. EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR FIRE-RELATED HAZARDS Outdoor burning – Outdoor burning is regulated by the Department of Environmental Protection, which allows outdoor burning of brush, cane, forestry debris, etc. during an annual period usually from January 15th through May 1st under the supervision and control of the Fire Department. Permits are issued during the annual period each year between the hours of 9:30 AM and 2:00 PM. The Woburn Fire Department web page contains a link with more information on outdoor burning. Development review –The Fire Department is involved in reviewing new developments. EXISTING CITY-WIDE MITIGATION FOR GEOLOGIC HAZARDS Massachusetts State Building Code – The State Building Code contains a section on designing for earthquake loads (780 CMR 1612.0). COMPILATION OF EXISTING MITIGATION Table 33 summarizes the many existing natural hazard mitigation measures already in place in Woburn when the first Hazard Mitigation Plan was developed in 2016. Because of the number of entities, public and private, involved in natural hazard mitigation, it is likely that this list is a starting point for a more comprehensive inventory of all measures.

These include Zoning Ordinances, Subdivision and Site Plan Review Regulations, Wetlands Ordinance, Health Regulations, Public Works regulations, and local enforcement of the State Building Code. Local Ordinances may be amended by the City Council to improve the city’s capabilities, and changes to most regulations simply require a public hearing and a vote of the authorized board or commission. The City of Woburn has recognized several existing mitigation measures that require implementation or improvements and has the capacity within its local boards and departments to address these.

        "SECTION 7: MITIGATION MEASURES FROM PREVIOUS PLAN IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS ON THE PREVIOUS PLAN At a meeting of the Woburn Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee, City staff reviewed the mitigation measures identified in the 2016 Woburn Hazard Mitigation Plan and determined whether each measure had been implemented or deferred. Of those measures that had been deferred, the committee evaluated whether the measure should be deleted or carried forward into this Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update. The decision on whether to delete or retain a particular measure was based on the committee’s assessment of the continued relevance or effectiveness of the measure and whether the deferral of action on the measure was due to the inability of the city to act on the measure.

Considerable work has been done to address drainage problems citywide. Three drainage projects were completed, and progress was made to reduce flooding on four additional projects. Progress was also made on stream, culvert and catch basin maintenance. A number of projects that were partially completed or not initiated have been continued into this plan update. The city also did outreach regarding heat risks, evaluated snow loads for some of its buildings, and is currently considering language restricting non-essential use of public water supply. Overall, fifteen mitigation measures from the 2016 plan will be continued in the plan update. Most retain the same priority in this 2021 Update. Moving forward into the next five-year plan implementation period there will be many more opportunities to incorporate hazard mitigation into the City’s decision-making processes. The challenges the city faces in implementing these measures are primarily due to limited funding and available staff time. This plan should help the city prioritize the best use of its limited resources for enhanced mitigation of natural hazards.

        "SECTION 8: HAZARD MITIGATION STRATEGY WHAT IS HAZARD MITIGATION? Hazard mitigation means to permanently reduce or alleviate the losses of life, injuries and property resulting from natural hazards through long-term strategies. These long-term strategies include planning, policy changes, education programs, infrastructure projects and other activities. FEMA currently has three mitigation grant programs: the Hazards Mitigation Grant Program (HGMP), the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program (PDM), and the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program. The three links below provide additional information on these programs. https://www.fema.gov/hazard-mitigation-grant-program https://www.fema.gov/pre-disaster-mitigation-grant-program https://www.fema.gov/flood-mitigation-assistance-grant-program Hazard Mitigation Measures can generally be sorted into the following groups: • Prevention: Government administrative or regulatory actions or processes that influence the way land and buildings are developed and built. These actions also include public activities to reduce hazard losses. Examples include planning and zoning, building codes, capital improvement programs, open space preservation, and stormwater management regulations. • Property Protection: Actions that involve the modification of existing buildings or infrastructure to protect them from a hazard or removal from the hazard area. Examples include acquisition, elevation, relocation, structural retrofits, flood proofing, storm shutters, and shatter resistant glass. • Public Education & Awareness: Actions to inform and educate citizens, elected officials, and property owners about the potential risks from hazards and potential ways to mitigate them. Such actions include outreach projects, real estate disclosure, hazard information centers, and school-age and adult education programs. • Natural Resource Protection: Actions that, in addition to minimizing hazard losses also preserve or restore the functions of natural systems. These actions include sediment and erosion control, stream corridor restoration, watershed management, forest and vegetation management, and wetland restoration and preservation. • Structural Projects: Actions that involve the construction of structures to reduce the impact of a hazard. Such structures include storm water controls (e.g., culverts), floodwalls, seawalls, retaining walls, and safe rooms. • Emergency Services Protection: Actions that will protect emergency services before, during, and immediately after an occurrence. Examples of these actions include protection of warning system capability, protection of critical facilities, and protection of emergency response infrastructure.

        "REGIONAL AND INTER-COMMUNITY CONSIDERATIONS Some hazard mitigation issues are strictly local. The problem originates primarily within the municipality and can be solved at the municipal level. Other issues are inter-community and require cooperation between two or more municipalities. There is a third level of mitigation which is regional and may involve a state, regional or federal agency, or three or more municipalities. REGIONAL PARTNERS In developed urban and suburban communities such as the metropolitan Boston area, mitigating natural hazards, particularly flooding, is more than a local issue. The drainage systems that serve these communities are complex systems of storm drains, roadway drainage structures, pump stations and other facilities owned and operated by a wide array of agencies including the City, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of these structures are integral to the flood hazard mitigation efforts of communities. These agencies must be considered the communities’ regional partners in hazard mitigation. These agencies also operate under the same constraints as communities do including budgetary and staffing constraints and they must make decisions about numerous competing priorities. Following, is a brief overview of regional facilities found in Woburn and a discussion of inter- municipal issues. OVERVIEW OF REGIONAL FACILITIES WITHIN WOBURN Major facilities owned, operated, and maintained by state or regional entities include: • State Routes 128, 38, and 3/3A (MassDOT) • Commuter Rail Mishawum and Anderson/Woburn stations (MBTA) INTER-COMMUNITY CONSIDERATIONS Mitigation measures for the following regional issues should be considered as Woburn develops its own local plan: A) Coordinate and Review Developments on a Regional Basis As Woburn and the surrounding communities are undergoing development, it is vital that these communities communicate and provide input during the review processes. When addressing housing, transportation, and economic development projects, the impacts to neighbors must be addressed. Woburn is a member of the North Suburban Planning Council (NSPC) of MAPC. NSPC includes the 8 surrounding communities who meet regularly to share information on planning issues. B) Watershed Management CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 80 of 114",
        "The Aberjona River is a tributary to the Mystic River. Woburn is working closely with the Mystic River Watershed Association and its member communities to collaborate on projects and sharing information. The group has been tackling issues related to stormwater management, flooding, water use, and climate change. NEW DEVELOPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE As part of the process of developing recommendations for new mitigation measures for this plan update, the City considered the issues related to new development, redevelopment, and infrastructure needs in order limit future risks. Taking into consideration the Wetlands Act and ordinance enforced by the Conservation Commission and adoption of more stringent stormwater regulations, the city determined that existing regulatory measures are taking good advantage of local Home Rule land use regulatory authority to minimize natural hazard impacts of development. Priorities in this plan include a focus on regulatory updates designed to reduce future flooding. PROCESS FOR SETTING PRIORITIES FOR MITIGATION MEASURES The last step in developing the City’s mitigation strategy is to assign a level of priority to each mitigation measure so as to guide the focus of the City’s limited resources towards those actions with the greatest potential benefit. At this stage in the process, the Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team had limited access to detailed analyses of the cost and benefits of any given mitigation measure, so prioritization is based on the local team members’ understanding of existing and potential hazard impacts and an approximate sense of the costs associated with pursuing any given mitigation measure. Priority setting was based on local knowledge of the hazard areas, including impacts of hazard events, the extent of the area impacted, and the relation of a given mitigation measure to the City’s goals. In addition, the local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team also took into consideration factors such as the number of homes and businesses affected, whether or not road closures occurred and what impact closures had on delivery of emergency services and the local economy, anticipated project costs, whether any environmental constraints existed, and whether the city would be able to justify the costs relative to the anticipated benefits. Table 35 below demonstrates the prioritization of the City’s potential hazard mitigation measures. For each mitigation measure, the geographic extent of the potential benefiting area is identified as is an estimate of the overall benefit and cost of the measures. The benefits, costs, and overall priority were evaluated in terms of: Estimated Benefits Action will result in a significant reduction of hazard risk to people and/or property from a High hazard event Action will likely result in a moderate reduction of hazard risk to people and/or property Medium from a hazard event CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 81 of 114",
        "Action will result in a low reduction of hazard risk to people and/or property from a hazard Low event Estimated Costs High Estimated costs greater than $100,000 Medium Estimated costs between $10,000 to $100,000 Low Estimated costs less than $10,000 and/or staff time Priority Action very likely to have political and public support and necessary maintenance can occur High following the project, and the costs seem reasonable considering likely benefits from the measure Medium Action may have political and public support and necessary maintenance has potential to occur following the project HAZARD MITIGATION STRATEGY Low Not clear if action has political and public support and not certain that necessary maintenance can occur following the project INTRODUCTION TO MITIGATION MEASURES TABLE Description of the Mitigation Measure – The description of each mitigation measure is brief and cost information is given only if cost data were already available from the community. The cost data represent a point in time and would need to be adjusted for inflation and for any changes or refinements in the design of a particular mitigation measure. Priority – As described above and summarized in Table 35, the designation of high, medium, or low priority was done considering potential benefits and estimated project costs, as well as other factors in the STAPLEE (Social, Technical, Administrative, Legal, Economic, and Environmental) analysis. Implementation Responsibility – The designation of implementation responsibility was done based on a general knowledge of what each municipal department is responsible for. It is likely that most mitigation measures will require that several departments work together and assigning staff is the sole responsibility of the governing body of each community. Time Frame – The time frame was based on a combination of the priority for that measure, the complexity of the measure and whether or not the measure is conceptual, in design, or already designed and awaiting funding. Because the time frame for this plan is five years, the timing for all mitigation measures has been kept within this framework. The identification of a likely time frame is not meant to constrain a community from taking advantage of funding opportunities as they arise. Potential Funding Sources – This column attempts to identify the most likely sources of funding for a specific measure. The information on potential funding sources in this table is preliminary and varies depending on a number of factors. These factors include whether or not a mitigation measure has been studied, evaluated, or designed, or if it is still in the conceptual stages.

        "and DCR assisted MAPC in reviewing the potential eligibility for hazard mitigation funding. Each grant program and agency has specific eligibility requirements that would need to be taken into consideration. In most instances, the measure will require a number of different funding sources. Identification of a potential funding source in this table does not guarantee that a project will be eligible for, or selected for, funding. Upon adoption of this plan, the local team responsible for its implementation should begin to explore the funding sources in more detail. Additional information on funding sources – The best way to determine eligibility for a particular funding source is to review the project with a staff person at the funding agency. The following websites provide an overview of programs and funding sources. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) – The website for the North Atlantic district office is http://www.nae.usace.army.mil/.

Install hydrodynamic separators at four outfalls. Cambridge Road – This project seeks to upgrade the drainage system to handle a larger volume of flow by replacing the existing drain under Cambridge Road with a 30-inch pipe. Hart Street/Winn Street -- Cleaning of the Hart Street area stream and culvert under Winn Street General stream maintenance- Sediment and debris and trash have decreased the hydraulic capacity of streams and drainage swales. Trash removal and dredging of approximately 10,000 linear feet is necessary. General stream culvert maintenance – Some culverts in the city have become blocked with sediment, debris, and trash. The report identifies 20 culverts in need of cleaning. Lake Terrace and Lake Circle Drainage Improvements – Clean, inspect and evaluate storm drain lines, manholes and catch basins. Install additional catch basins and drain manholes. Washington Street near Cedar Street (Staples) – This drainage project consists of installing a parallel relief system to convey stormwater under Washington Street. Gill street – Flooding occurs at the end of Gill Street due to inadequate drainage. Investigate clearing the drainage ditch and establishing better drainage to Hall’s Brook. Drainage improvement at Prospect St and Jefferson Avenue – Drainage work is needed hear due to an undersized 60-inch culvert. Investigate sources of stormwater flooding – As noted in this plan, stormwater flooding occurs in many locations outside of FEMA flood zones. The City will analyze flooding locations and reach out to residents to investigate historic flood damage. Provide property retrofit materials to residents – The City will develop materials and do outreach to encourage adoption of property retrofit strategies. New Boston St. at Hall’s Brook – Flooding from Hall’s Brook impacts the roadway. Drainage improvements are needed. Prospect Street and Jefferson Avenue – Flooding due to drainage issues occurs at the intersection and up to Garfield Street and along the wetlands area between Auburn Avenue and Hanson Court.

Review HVAC capacity for municipal buildings – Investigate and improve cooling capacity in the municipal and school buildings that have not been updated. Wildfires Consider becoming a Firewise Community – The national Firewise Communities program offers communities a structured way to undertake community-based activities to lessen the impact of brush fires. Purchase a brush truck – The Fire Department would like to purchase a brush truck to be better equipped to respond to brush fires. Invasive Species Manage invasives through permitting requirements - Utilize permit conditions issued by the Conservation Commission, Planning Board, and others to remove and control invasive species, particularly on large development parcels. Severe Winter Storm/Nor’easter Public awareness campaign – The City should increase its public awareness activities including the use of social media and written materials on winter hazards that would be available at City Hall and mailed to residents with their tax bills. Multihazards Increase funding of tree management work – Funding would increase the capacity of the DPW to manage street trees, addressing and reducing damage caused by wind and other sources. (This item addresses Hurricanes and Tropical Storms, Tornadoes, and Other Severe Weather.) Adopt a climate action plan – A climate action plan will focus on strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This will help address long-term climate impacts, as well as developing alternate energy strategies that can reduce vulnerability to power outages. Earthquake Implement seismic upgrades to the communications center - The Public Safety building should be reviewed to determine if changes are needed in order to be brought up to seismic standards.

        "SECTION 9: PLAN ADOPTION & MAINTENANCE PLAN ADOPTION The Woburn Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update was adopted by the Mayor on [ADD DATE]. See Appendix D for documentation. The plan was approved by FEMA on [ADD DATE] for a five- year period that will expire on [ADD DATE]. PLAN MAINTENANCE MAPC worked with the Woburn Hazard Mitigation Team to prepare this plan. This group will continue to meet on an as-needed basis to coordinate the implementation and maintenance of this plan. A member of the City staff will be designated as the team coordinator. Additional members could be added to the local team from businesses, non-profits, and institutions. The city will encourage public participation during the next 5-year planning cycle. As updates and a review of the plan are conducted by the Hazard Mitigation Team, these will be placed on the City’s web site, and any meetings of the Hazard Mitigation Team will be publicly noticed in accordance with city and state open meeting laws. IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION SCHEDULE Mid-Term Survey on Progress – The coordinator of the Hazard Mitigation Team will prepare and distribute a survey in year three of the plan. The survey will be distributed to all the local team members and other interested local stakeholders. The survey will poll the members on progress and accomplishments for implementation, any new hazards or problem areas that have been identified, and any changes or revisions to the plan that may be needed. This information will be used to prepare a report or addendum to the local hazard mitigation plan in order to evaluate its effectiveness in meeting the plan’s goals and identify areas that need to be updated in the next plan. The Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team will have primary responsibility for tracking progress, evaluating, and updating the plan. Begin to Prepare for the next Plan Update – FEMA’s approval of this plan is valid for five years, by which time an updated plan must be approved by FEMA in order to maintain the City’s approved plan status and its eligibility for FEMA mitigation grants. Given the lead time needed to secure funding and conduct the planning process, the Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team will begin to prepare for an update of the plan in year three. This will help the City avoid a lapse in its approved plan status and grant eligibility when the current plan expires. The Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team will use the information from the Mid-Term progress review to identify the needs and priorities for the plan update and seek funding for the plan update process. Potential sources of funding may include FEMA Pre-Disaster Mitigation grants and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Both grant programs can pay for 75% of a planning project, with a 25% local cost share required. Prepare and Adopt an Updated Local Hazard Mitigation Plan – Once the resources have been secured to update the plan, the Hazard Mitigation Team may decide to undertake the update themselves, contract with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council to update the plan or to hire another consultant. However, the Hazard Mitigation Implementation Team decides to update the CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 88 of 114",

Once the next plan update is prepared, the City will submit it to MEMA and FEMA for review and approval and adopt the plan update in order to obtain formal FEMA approval of the plan. INTEGRATION OF THE PLANS WITH OTHER PLANNING INITIATIVES Upon approval of the Woburn Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update by FEMA, the Local Hazard Mitigation Team will provide all interested parties and implementing departments with a copy of the plan and will initiate a discussion regarding how the plan can be integrated into that department’s ongoing work. At a minimum, the plan will be reviewed and discussed with the following departments: • Fire/Emergency Management • Police • Public Works • Planning • Engineering • Building Department • Conservation Other groups that will be coordinated with include large institutions, Chambers of Commerce, land conservation organizations and watershed groups. The plan will also be posted on the City’s website with the caveat that a local team coordinator will review the plan for sensitive information that would be inappropriate for public posting. The posting of the plan on the website will include a mechanism for citizen feedback such as an e-mail address to send comments. The hazard mitigation plan provided crucial data and analysis for the climate resilience planning completed by the city and referenced in Appendix E. The plan has contributed to a focus on stormwater management including the adoption of a Stormwater Ordinance and associated regulations.

        "APPENDIX E: MVP WORKSHOP RESULTS Highest Priorities developed in Climate Resilience Planning Workshop, April 2019 • Horn Pond Brook hydraulic and vegetation improvements for flood control and fish migration. • Address flooding at Four Corners at the intersection of Cambridge and Russell Streets. o Reduce flooding by adding flood storage and wetland creation/restoration in adjacent empty lot along Russell Street that the City is in the process of acquiring. o Repair culvert along Shaker Glen Brook o Floodproof businesses o Work with business to add green infrastructure as well as permeable surfaces o Repair drainage to allow emergency access to west side of the City during high intensity rain events • Increase storage, drainage upgrades, drainage improvements, raise roads and add green infrastructure in areas that flood regularly, including but not limited to Four Corners, Olympia Ave, Nashua/Draper St, New Boston St, Washington Street, Salem St, and School St. • Improve stream crossings/culverts – increase capacity and clean regularly. • Additional funding to DPW for road/drainage maintenance and upgrades. DPW preventative maintenance plan and stormwater management plan. • Add an additional emergency shelter in the City. • Coordinate and improve communications systems with EMS. Work with doctors, senior center, housing authority, grocery stores and shelters to pass along information on the RAVE system (State and local emergency notification system) to seniors, low income, commuting, non-English speaking residents. Create list of at-risk residents in case of power failure. Provide incentives to look in on fragile residents more systematically. Consider more extensive training (less than EMS). • Upgrade and increase drinking water management for increased population and drought. This could include redundant pumps, capital improvement plan, investment, and execution. • Add additional requirements for new developments. These areas can contribute to stormwater retention and green infrastructure to reduce flooding. Avoid losing open space. Floodplain zoning should be for a 500-year storm. • Develop a stormwater task force. Review and update stormwater ordinance as necessary to address stormwater quality and quantity and to promote stormwater management onsite. • Maximize site-specific stormwater retention. Identify opportunities for enhanced stormwater retention. CITY OF WOBURN – HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN – 2021 UPDATE 114 of 114 _ f _faf"
