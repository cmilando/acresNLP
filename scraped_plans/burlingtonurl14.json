    "ALL TEXT": "2018 Vermont State Hazard Mitigation Plan - Approved 11/17/18 4: Vermont Profile & Hazard Assessment Vermont Profile Vermont is located astride the Green Mountains at the center of three ranges of the Appalachians, with the Adirondacks to the west and the White Mountains to the east. Vermont encompasses 9,250 square miles of landmass. Population Trends: Geographically, Vermont is the sixth smallest state and the second least populated. The population of Vermont was 625,741 based on the 2010 Census and is estimated to have decreased to 623,657 in 2017, a decline of approximately 0.3%. As the maps below indicate (Figures 17 & 18), there have been relatively minor changes in population statewide since 2010. Some counties have experienced slight gains (most notably Chittenden, +3,965), and other counties have experienced decreases (most notably Rutland, -1,509). Most Vermonters live in small, rural communities with populations of several hundred to several thousand pePooppleu.l aT�hoen l abryg eCsotu cnittyy i2s0 B1u6rlington, with aP pooppuulala�tioonn C ohfa 4n2g,e5 5260 1(200 -1 260 A16CS estimate). 3965 <10,000 0 to 1,000 10,000 to 40,000 -500 to 0 40,000 to 61,000 -1,000 to -500 160,510 -1,509 Figure 17: Vermont population by Figure 18: Vermont population county map (2016) change by county map (2010-2016) Source: 2016 ACS 5-year estimates Source: 2016 ACS 5-year estimates Development Trends: Historically, communities and infrastructure have often been sited in valleys and near water bodies, both globally and in Vermont. This development pattern was based on the assumption that rivers and coastlines would not shift or change course, which in turn relied on an assumption that climate conditions would remain relatively static. Today, with climate change models predicting increased precipitation and stronger storms in New England, many communities now find themselves and their infrastructure increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters like flooding. With the benefit of time, it is now understood that rivers and water bodies naturally adjust and change course, again threatening much of the infrastructure that lies in their path. 39SECTION 4: VERMONT PROFILE & HAZARD ASSESSMENT Between 2000 and 2010, there were no large-scale increases in either commercial or residential development in Vermont, with a total net increase of 28,157 housing units statewide. From 2010-2016, there has only been an estimated increase of 4,273 housing units (2016 ACS estimate) (Figure 20). Though this updated figure represents a shorter period of time for development, this trend, combined with population trends, suggests that the rate of new housing development in Vermont is declining.

To get a better understanding of local development, VEM staff asked Regional Planning Commissions (RPCs) to note significant changes in development trends within their regions over the past five years and their impact on vulnerability, included in Table 12 below. Regions reporting no significant changes in development are not included. In addition to the feedback from RPCs, several communities were added to Table 12 below based on the review of currently approved LHMPs (for more information on this review process, see: State & Local Capabilities). Predominately, LHMPs report that little, if any, development has taken place since their previous Plan and that vulnerability has remained the same and is not projected to change. Table 12: Changes in Development by Region Region Munipality Changes in Development & Vulnerability ACRPC Middlebury Mitigation project in East Middlebury creates a false sense of security. Development of athletic fields in the floodplain increased flood depths downtown. BCRC Bennington Putnam Block hotel project will increase development downtown in the floodplain, though the project will include flood-proofing of new and existing buildings and is supporting a downtown. CCRPC Montpelier Several developments are planned in the City of Montpelier within the floodplain, including a hotel and a distillery. All new development will be required to follow Montpelier’s NFIP standards. CCRPC Jeffersonville Village Vulnerable has been reduced due to FEMA-funded projects, including the Greenway Trail Bridge replacement project and floodplain restoration, and drainage improvements downtown that are currently underway. CCRPC Grand Isle There has been a decline in agricultural use of land, a small amount of additional residential development along existing roadways and the shoreline, and some commercial development along Route 2. This development has not occurred in hazard-prone areas. Continued on pg. 412018 Vermont State Hazard Mitigation Plan - Approved 11/17/18 Region Munipality Changes in Development & Vulnerability CVRPC Barre City, Northfield, Home buyout projects have restored the floodplain to reduce and eliminate risk from flooding. Middlesex CVRPC Plainfield Home buyouts at risk from landslide and fluvial erosion have eliminated risk for specific properties. NVDA Concord, Maidstone, Conversion of seasonal homes to year-round use causes more use of old septic systems close to Westmore, Barnet lakes – creating potential for contamination to surface waters. Roads that used to only be used seasonally are now used year-round. RRPC Brandon Box culvert was built to allow the Neshobe River to pass through downtown during heavy flows and reduce vulnerability in town. TRORC Woodstock Major infrastructure was rebuilt in floodplain after Irene; the village area is highly vulnerable to inundation and fluvial erosion. WRC Brattleboro While no significant development has happened in Brattleboro according to their most recent LHMP, a pending Pre-Disaster Mitigation project for property buyouts and floodplain restoration on the Whetstone Brook will lower flood levels in Brattleboro. WRC Dover Changes are expected due to Mount Snow Resort development, possibly including changes to flood patterns due to snowmaking water in a different watershed. WRC South Newfane Home sales are lagging, due perhaps to flooding issues; the town may begin to depopulate. The only significant development within State-owned buildings since 2013 was the Waterbury State Office Complex, which was awarded LEED Platinum designation in December of 2017. The complex was significantly damaged during Tropical Storm Irene in 2011 and was redeveloped to accommodate future flood predictions. The buildings now lie above the 0.2% annual flood level and incorporate dry flood-proofing to provide further protection from future flooding. Transportation: Vermont owns approximately 3,100 miles of State highway and there are 772 miles of federal highway within the State (Figure 21). Transportation systems that run north to south within the State are I-89 (northwestward from White River Junction to the Canadian border, serving both Montpelier and Burlington), I-91 (northward from the Massachusetts border to the Canadian border, connecting Brattleboro, White River Junction, St. Johnsbury, and Newport), and I-93 (northern terminus at I-91 in St. Johnsbury, connecting the northern part of Vermont with New Hampshire). Other significant routes include U.S. Route 5 (running south to north along the eastern border of Vermont, parallel to I-91 for its entire length in the State), U.S. Route 7 (running south to north, along the western border of the State, connecting Burlington, Middlebury, Rutland, and Bennington) and Vermont Route 100 (running south to north almost directly through the center of the State, providing a route along the full length of the Green Mountains). East-west routes include U.S. Route 2 (crossing northern Vermont from west to east, and connecting the population centers of Burlington, Montpelier, and St. Johnsbury), U.S. Route 4 (crossing south-central Vermont from west to east, from the New York border in the Town of Fair Haven, through the City of Rutland, and across to Killington and White River Junction), U.S. Route 302 (traveling east from Montpelier and Barre, into New Hampshire and Maine), Vermont Route 9 (running across the southern part of the State from Bennington to Brattleboro), and Vermont Route 105 (crossing the northernmost parts of Vermont and connecting the cities of St. Albans and Newport). 41SECTION 4: VERMONT PROFILE & HAZARD ASSESSMENT Green Mountain Rural Community Transit (GMT) Transporta�on Inc.

The next largest transportation category was walking, with 45% of respondents walking as a means of transport multiple times per week or month1. Fourteen percent reported biking frequently, while 8% noted frequent use of public transportation. Vermont is served by the Burlington International Airport (BTV). Vermont has eleven different bus companies (Figure 22), two ferry companies and three rail service lines throughout the State. The State of Vermont also has a program called Go Vermont2, which is a resource for travelers who want to reduce the cost and environmental impact of driving. It provides information on bus routes, biking, or walking and features a free carpool/vanpool matching service and ridesharing tips. The State is served by Amtrak’s Vermonter and Ethan Allen Express passenger lines, the New England Central Railroad, the Vermont Railway, and the Green Mountain Railroad. The Ethan Allen Express serves Rutland and Castleton, while the Vermonter serves Saint Albans, Essex Junction, Waterbury, Montpelier, Randolph, White River Junction, Windsor, Bellows Falls, and Brattleboro, with a planned extension to Canada. 1 http://vtrans.vermont.gov/sites/aot/files/planning/documents/planning/Existing%20Conditions%20%20Future%20 Trends%206-7-17.pdf 2 https://www.connectingcommuters.org/ 422018 Vermont State Hazard Mitigation Plan - Approved 11/17/18 Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) - 2016 Popula�on Over 65 - 2016 Vulnerable Populations: Natural hazards can affect everyone in Vermont, but some populations may be more vulnerable to certain types of events or more significantly impacted during events. The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)3 defines overall vulnerability by summarizing four themes: socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status and language, and housing and transportation. Figure 23 depicts this overall score by census block, broken into four relative categories High of overall vulnerability. Med-High <15% Med-Low 15-20% Vermonters over the age of 65 Low >20% is a specific demographic that is potentially more vulnerable to Figure 23: Social Vulnerability Index map Figure 24: Vermont population over 65 certain events, such as extreme heat. (2016) map (2016) Source: https://svi.cdc.gov/map.aspx Source: 2016 ACS 5-year estimates In 2016, 17% of Vermont was over the age of 65 based on estimates from the U.S. Census, above the national average of 14.5%. Figure 24 the percent population over 65 by county, with the most significant population in Essex County (23%, 1,408 people). Vulnerability can also be economic. Vermont’s median household income was estimated at $56,104 in 2016, slightly above the national average of $55,322. To better account for cost of living in Vermont, Vermont’s Joint Fiscal Office develops a report biennially that determines a livable hourly wage for Vermonters4. This analysis estimates how much an individual would need to make, at a minimum, in order to live in Vermont based on a variety of family configurations and assuming employer-sponsored healthcare. The overall livable wage rate in 2016 was defined as $27,102 in individual income for a full-time worker in a two-person household without children. That equates to a household income of $54,205, which is just below the median household income for Vermont. The below table includes the various household types considered in the report and their corresponding livable wage figures.

Most notably, the Earth has experienced a 1°F rise in temperature, which has far-reaching impacts on weather patterns and ecosystems. This statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended period (typically decades or longer), is known as climate change5. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5°F to 10°F over the next century, which will affect different regions in various ways over time. Impacts will also directly relate to the ability of different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change6. Increasing temperatures are forecasted to have significant impacts on weather-related disasters, which will also increase risk to life, economy and quality of life, critical infrastructure and natural ecosystems. The IPCC notes that the range of published evidence indicates that the costs associated with net damages of climate change are likely to be significant and will increase over time. It is therefore imperative that recognition of a changing climate be incorporated into all planning processes when preparing for and responding to weather-related emergencies and disasters. Most of the natural hazards identified below are likely to be exacerbated by changes in climate, either directly or indirectly. This section begins to review changes in our global and regional climate, which are further addressed in the hazard profiles, including: • Precipitation: Inundation Flooding & Fluvial Erosion; Drought; Wildfire; Landslides; Snow Storm & Ice Storm • Temperature: Extreme Cold; Extreme Heat; Drought; Wildfire; Invasive Species; Infectious Disease; Snow Storm & Ice Storm • Snow Cover: Snow Storm & Ice Storm; Drought; Wildfire The National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) reports that global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment: glaciers are shrinking, sea ice is disappearing, sea level rise is accelerating, heat waves are occurring more frequently and intensely, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted, and trees are flowering sooner. Though climate change is expected to have global reach, the impacts differ by region. While the southwestern United States is expected to experience increased heat, wildfire, drought and insect outbreaks, the northeastern region is predicted to experience increases in heat waves, downpours and flooding. Accordingly, consideration of climate change was identified as a key guiding principle of the 2018 SHMP, addressed in each of the pertinent hazard profiles and incorporated into all relevant mitigation actions. 5 http://www.ipcc.ch/ 44 6 https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/ pmeT mumixaM egarevA Years Average Minimum Temp Vermont’s Annual Maximum and Minimum Temperatures (1960-2015) 58.0 44 54.8 40 51.6 36 48.4 32 45.2 42.0 28 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Figure 25: Vermont’s annual maximum and minimum temperatures (1960-2015) Data Source: climatechange.vermont.gov2018 Vermont State Hazard Mitigation Plan - Approved 11/17/18 Vermont’s Annual Precipita�on Vermont’s Annual Precipitation (1960-2015) 60 Annual Precip.

Similarly, the average annual precipitation has risen 0.7” per decade since 1895 and 1.5” per decade since 19607 (Figure 26), suggesting increasing trends in both temperature and precipitation. According to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, the average annual precipitation in the United States has increased by approximately 5%8. Of particular note, the Assessment also identifies the northern U.S. as being more likely to experience above average precipitation in the winter and spring, with even wetter conditions expected under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. In addition to higher annual precipitation in both the observed record and projected models, the northeastern United States is also projected to experience more frequent, heavier rainfall events. Since 1991, the incidence of these heavy precipitation events has been 30% above average9. Another climate change concern in Vermont is the potential for climate refugees. As portions of the U.S. become more arid and as sea levels continue to rise, Vermont may begin to see significant increases in population. One study on sea-level rise displacement projects over 4,000 migrants to Vermont from across the U.S., most predominately in Chittenden County. This study does not account for people moving from increasingly arid areas within the U.S. or from outside of the U.S., which may also increase net immigration. Based on the unpredictable nature and potential impact of an influx of climate refugees into the State, the Steering Committee decided to acknowledge climate refugees as a potential future hazard facing Vermont, to be reassessed during the next SHMP update. HAZARD ASSESSMENT A risk assessment is used to measure the potential loss of life, personal injury, economic impact, and property damage resulting from natural hazards by analyzing the vulnerability of people, the built environment, the economy and the natural environment. VEM staff used several methods to identify risks in Vermont, including the evaluation of historical data, consideration of changing climate trends, and feedback from stakeholders. This examination involved an extensive review of natural disasters in Vermont, both declared and undeclared. Man-made and technological hazards are covered extensively in the 2018 Vermont State Emergency Management Plan (SEMP), which follows a risk assessment methodology similar to that used in this Plan. Accordingly, the following sections of the risk assessment identify the natural hazards that Vermonters can expect to face over the next fifty years and beyond, and the mitigation strategies section reviews the actions underway or planned to address these hazards and risks. As noted in the 2013 SHMP, and confirmed again in this 2018 SHMP, the natural hazards not incorporated are coastal erosion, expansive soils, Karst topography, sinkholes, tsunamis and volcanoes. These hazards are considered non-significant, unlikely hazards in Vermont and therefore do not warrant extensive review and consideration in this Plan. Table 19 explains how each hazard addressed in the 2013 SHMP was considered in this Plan. Hazard Events One of the most significant changes from the 2013 Plan to the 2018 Plan is the way hazards are assessed. Instead of continuing to view hazards as events (e.g. hurricanes), the 2018 SHMP assesses the impacts of events (e.g. inundation flooding, fluvial erosion, and wind as impacts of a hurricane event), as it is the impacts, not the events, that can be mitigated. Table 15 represents the initial analysis of hazard events by the Steering Committee, which informed the creation of the hazard impact assessment. 7 http://climatechange.vermont.gov/our-changing-climate/dashboard/more-annual-precipitation 8 https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/precipitation-change 9 https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/heavy-downpours-increasing 462018 Vermont State Hazard Mitigation Plan - Approved 11/17/18 Table 15: Hazard Events Assessment Hazard Events Hazard Type Probability Hazard Impacts Rainstorm/Thunderstorm Meteorological Highly Likely Erosion; Inundation; Wind; Hail; Lightning Winter Storm Meteorological Likely Snow; Ice; Wind Landslide Geological Likely Inundation; Erosion Drought Meteorological Likely Tropical Storm/Hurricane Meteorological Occasionally Erosion; Inundation; Wind Ice Jam Meteorological Occasionally Inundation; Erosion Tornado Meteorological Occasionally Hail; Wind Wildfire Meteorological Occasionally Earthquake Geological Occasionally Hazard Impacts The Steering Committee ranked the natural hazard impacts associated with the events listed above. Table 16 presents that ranking, including the probability of occurrence and potential impact to infrastructure, life, economy and the environment. Table 17 details the hazard assessment ranking criteria.

While these hazards are profiled individually, this Plan and the hazard assessment sections recognize that hazards do not occur in silos; many of the hazards are inter-related and often occur in tandem. To highlight the most significant relationships, the fluvial erosion and inundation flooding assessments were combined, as well as the ice and snow storm assessments. Each individual hazard assessment section also references the other pertinent hazards and their content, when applicable. Beyond the potential of simultaneous occurrence, several of the hazards also have the potential to cause other hazards. Causal relationships are identified in Table 18 (with causal hazards identified in green and resulting hazards identified in blue) and further addressed in pertinent hazard assessment sections. Combined with the projected increases in both precipitation and temperature, this assessment highlights the more significant compounding impacts that Vermont can anticipate in the future due to climate change. 48 yradnoceS drazaH tcapmI )tluseR( noisorE laivulF gnidoolF notiadnunI ecI wonS dniW taeH dloC thguorD sedilsdnaL erfidliW ekauqhtraE seicepS evisavnI esaesiD suoticefnI liaH Primary Hazard (Causal) Fluvial Erosion Inundation Flooding Ice Snow Wind Heat Cold Drought Landslides Wildfire Earthquake Invasive Species Infectious Disease Hail Table 19: Hazard Assessment Changes from the 2013 SHMP Hazards Addressed in 2013 Hazards Addressed in 2018 Flooding and Fluvial Erosion Inundation Flooding; Fluvial Erosion Terrorism Man-made hazards removed.

Invasive Species Invasive Species Extreme Temperatures Hazard impacts seperated (Heat; Cold)2018 Vermont State Hazard Mitigation Plan - Approved 11/17/18 Jurisdictional Vulnerability In conjunction with the risk assessment, VEM staff conducted a vulnerability assessment, which predicts the extent of damage that may result from a hazard event of a given intensity in a given area and considers damage to the existing and future built environment, the natural environment, and populations within Vermont. Vulnerability was determined by identifying the threats posed to people, property, the environment, and the economy. Hazard-specific vulnerability is detailed further in the individual hazard profiles. Though a small state, Vermont’s topography and mountainous setting can result in geographic isolation during severe storms, which can have significant localized impacts. A localized storm can drop a significant amount of water into a small watershed, devastating one town or cutting it off from the rest of the State, while causing no damage to an adjacent town on the other side of a mountain. The mountainous areas in Vermont vulnerable to these phenomena are numerous. Because of the steep mountain topography, damage from frequently occurring extreme weather events in any specific location may occur often or only once in a lifetime, which makes it difficult to plan for and responding to events. Coupled with this topographic isolation, the rural nature of the State can also result in isolation from necessary emergency response efforts. Most communities in Vermont have an identified local Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and/or shelter for its residents, should an event warrant their opening and often require a back- up energy source, typically in the form of generators. In order to keep these critical facilities functioning in times of need, VEM is regularly contacted for equipment and training requests and financial assistance. Other critical facilities that have applied for funding through the State are wastewater treatment plants and fire departments, which require back-up energy sources during events that may result in community-wide power loss (e.g. flooding, wind storm, ice/snow storm), or which require flood-proofing to reduce vulnerability to flood damage. Jurisdictional Risk Assessments: In an effort to validate the risk assessment completed by the Steering Committee, and as one of the metrics used to assess local vulnerability, VEM staff asked RPCs to rank the same list of hazards based on the perceived Table 20: Hazard Assessment Ranking by Regional Planning Commission Hazard Impact Average ACRPC BCRC CCRPC CVRPC LCPC NRPC NVDA RRPC SWCRPC TRORC WRC Inundation Flooding 2.2 9 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 Fluvial Erosion 2.3 3 2 1 2 4 3 5 1 2 1 1 Snow 4.5 12 3 4 3 1 5 2 7 3 6 3 Ice 4.6 1 9 6 4 5 2 3 4 9 3 5 Wind 5.1 2 4 3 6 6 4 6 3 6 4 12 Cold 7.4 17 8 5 5 3 13 4 5 4 10 10 Invasive Species 8.0 4 6 10 10 9 11 13 8 -- 5 4 Landslides 8.4 7 12 13 8 7 6 8 10 7 8 6 Wildfire 8.8 6 11 9 7 11 9 10 13 5 9 7 Drought 9.3 11 7 11 12 10 8 9 11 8 7 8 Hail 9.5 10 14 12 9 8 7 7 6 11 11 9 Infectious Disease 10.0 5 5 7 14 12 10 12 12 -- 12 11 Heat 11.1 8 10 8 13 13 14 11 9 10 13 13 Earthquake 13.1 12 13 14 11 14 12 14 14 12 14 14 49SECTION 4: VERMONT PROFILE & HAZARD ASSESSMENT vulnerability in their respective Table 21: Hazards Addressed in Local Hazard Mitigation Plans regions.

The report was developed to help Vermont communities better manage their flood risk and included an analysis that defined the top 32 communities where flooding risk is high, based on economic activity, at-risk infrastructure, and at-risk non-residential buildings. ACCD completed more detailed analyses for the top six communities, for which projects were defined that would reduce vulnerability and prioritize investment: Barre City and Town, Brandon, Brattleboro, Enosburg Village and Town, and Woodstock. In additional to these top communities, many of the priority areas have seen increased investment in mitigation work, as noted Table 23.

This assessment, which included all State-owned and leased properties, considered both criticality of the buildings’ functions and the vulnerability of the structures based on location. As the two most significant hazards identified in this Plan, the BGS risk assessment project focused primarily on fluvial erosion and flood inundation vulnerability. Further, assessing risk based on these hazards was fairly straightforward, as BGS could access both State and FEMA mapping data specific to fluvial erosion and inundation flooding. Using these data, BGS assessed vulnerability of an individual structure according to its proximity to the FEMA-mapped 100- and 500-yr floodplains, as well as the river corridor. An overall vulnerability score was assigned to each structure using a point system outlined in the Appendix to Section 3. Structures were then assessed according to their criticality to the following State functions: • Emergency Operations • Government Operations • Public Safety • Public Health • Public Service • Economic Activity • Cultural Resources 53SECTION 4: VERMONT PROFILE & HAZARD ASSESSMENT BGS then used the scores for criticality and vulnerability to determine building prioritization for developing mitigation measures. The risk assessment also includes information on each building’s current function, construction type and year, number of floors, building replacement cost, cost of personal property and cost of computer equipment. A detailed description of this risk assessment, prioritization process and alternatives analysis for the top priority State-owned structures can be found in the Appendix to Section 3. Though the BGS project focused primarily on fluvial erosion and inundation flooding, the data acquired are pertinent to all natural hazards profiled in this Plan that could impact State-owned or leased structures. That is, a building’s replacement cost will be the same regardless of what hazard was responsible for its destruction. Similarly, a building’s criticality score does not differ hazard-to-hazard. Further, without high fidelity hazard mapping data for all natural hazards, determining true vulnerability of a structure based on proximity to a clearly delineated hazard area is very difficult. The full list of all State-owned buildings and their replacement costs as defined above in is the Appendix to Section 4. 54",

        "2018 Vermont State Hazard Mitigation Plan - Approved 11/17/18 4: Vermont Profile & Hazard Assessment Vermont Profile Vermont is located astride the Green Mountains at the center of three ranges of the Appalachians, with the Adirondacks to the west and the White Mountains to the east. Vermont encompasses 9,250 square miles of landmass. Population Trends: Geographically, Vermont is the sixth smallest state and the second least populated. The population of Vermont was 625,741 based on the 2010 Census and is estimated to have decreased to 623,657 in 2017, a decline of approximately 0.3%. As the maps below indicate (Figures 17 & 18), there have been relatively minor changes in population statewide since 2010. Some counties have experienced slight gains (most notably Chittenden, +3,965), and other counties have experienced decreases (most notably Rutland, -1,509).

This development pattern was based on the assumption that rivers and coastlines would not shift or change course, which in turn relied on an assumption that climate conditions would remain relatively static. Today, with climate change models predicting increased precipitation and stronger storms in New England, many communities now find themselves and their infrastructure increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters like flooding. With the benefit of time, it is now understood that rivers and water bodies naturally adjust and change course, again threatening much of the infrastructure that lies in their path. 39",
        "SECTION 4: VERMONT PROFILE & HAZARD ASSESSMENT Between 2000 and 2010, there were no large-scale increases in either commercial or residential development in Vermont, with a total net increase of 28,157 housing units statewide. From 2010-2016, there has only been an estimated increase of 4,273 housing units (2016 ACS estimate) (Figure 20). Though this updated figure represents a shorter period of time for development, this trend, combined with population trends, suggests that the rate of new housing development in Vermont is declining.

To get a better understanding of local development, VEM staff asked Regional Planning Commissions (RPCs) to note significant changes in development trends within their regions over the past five years and their impact on vulnerability, included in Table 12 below. Regions reporting no significant changes in development are not included. In addition to the feedback from RPCs, several communities were added to Table 12 below based on the review of currently approved LHMPs (for more information on this review process, see: State & Local Capabilities). Predominately, LHMPs report that little, if any, development has taken place since their previous Plan and that vulnerability has remained the same and is not projected to change. Table 12: Changes in Development by Region Region Munipality Changes in Development & Vulnerability ACRPC Middlebury Mitigation project in East Middlebury creates a false sense of security. Development of athletic fields in the floodplain increased flood depths downtown. BCRC Bennington Putnam Block hotel project will increase development downtown in the floodplain, though the project will include flood-proofing of new and existing buildings and is supporting a downtown. CCRPC Montpelier Several developments are planned in the City of Montpelier within the floodplain, including a hotel and a distillery. All new development will be required to follow Montpelier’s NFIP standards. CCRPC Jeffersonville Village Vulnerable has been reduced due to FEMA-funded projects, including the Greenway Trail Bridge replacement project and floodplain restoration, and drainage improvements downtown that are currently underway. CCRPC Grand Isle There has been a decline in agricultural use of land, a small amount of additional residential development along existing roadways and the shoreline, and some commercial development along Route 2. This development has not occurred in hazard-prone areas. Continued on pg. 41",
        "2018 Vermont State Hazard Mitigation Plan - Approved 11/17/18 Region Munipality Changes in Development & Vulnerability CVRPC Barre City, Northfield, Home buyout projects have restored the floodplain to reduce and eliminate risk from flooding. Middlesex CVRPC Plainfield Home buyouts at risk from landslide and fluvial erosion have eliminated risk for specific properties. NVDA Concord, Maidstone, Conversion of seasonal homes to year-round use causes more use of old septic systems close to Westmore, Barnet lakes – creating potential for contamination to surface waters. Roads that used to only be used seasonally are now used year-round. RRPC Brandon Box culvert was built to allow the Neshobe River to pass through downtown during heavy flows and reduce vulnerability in town. TRORC Woodstock Major infrastructure was rebuilt in floodplain after Irene; the village area is highly vulnerable to inundation and fluvial erosion. WRC Brattleboro While no significant development has happened in Brattleboro according to their most recent LHMP, a pending Pre-Disaster Mitigation project for property buyouts and floodplain restoration on the Whetstone Brook will lower flood levels in Brattleboro. WRC Dover Changes are expected due to Mount Snow Resort development, possibly including changes to flood patterns due to snowmaking water in a different watershed. WRC South Newfane Home sales are lagging, due perhaps to flooding issues; the town may begin to depopulate. The only significant development within State-owned buildings since 2013 was the Waterbury State Office Complex, which was awarded LEED Platinum designation in December of 2017. The complex was significantly damaged during Tropical Storm Irene in 2011 and was redeveloped to accommodate future flood predictions. The buildings now lie above the 0.2% annual flood level and incorporate dry flood-proofing to provide further protection from future flooding. Transportation: Vermont owns approximately 3,100 miles of State highway and there are 772 miles of federal highway within the State (Figure 21). Transportation systems that run north to south within the State are I-89 (northwestward from White River Junction to the Canadian border, serving both Montpelier and Burlington), I-91 (northward from the Massachusetts border to the Canadian border, connecting Brattleboro, White River Junction, St. Johnsbury, and Newport), and I-93 (northern terminus at I-91 in St. Johnsbury, connecting the northern part of Vermont with New Hampshire). Other significant routes include U.S. Route 5 (running south to north along the eastern border of Vermont, parallel to I-91 for its entire length in the State), U.S. Route 7 (running south to north, along the western border of the State, connecting Burlington, Middlebury, Rutland, and Bennington) and Vermont Route 100 (running south to north almost directly through the center of the State, providing a route along the full length of the Green Mountains). East-west routes include U.S. Route 2 (crossing northern Vermont from west to east, and connecting the population centers of Burlington, Montpelier, and St. Johnsbury), U.S. Route 4 (crossing south-central Vermont from west to east, from the New York border in the Town of Fair Haven, through the City of Rutland, and across to Killington and White River Junction), U.S. Route 302 (traveling east from Montpelier and Barre, into New Hampshire and Maine), Vermont Route 9 (running across the southern part of the State from Bennington to Brattleboro), and Vermont Route 105 (crossing the northernmost parts of Vermont and connecting the cities of St. Albans and Newport). 41",

The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)3 defines overall vulnerability by summarizing four themes: socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status and language, and housing and transportation. Figure 23 depicts this overall score by census block, broken into four relative categories High of overall vulnerability. Med-High <15% Med-Low 15-20% Vermonters over the age of 65 Low >20% is a specific demographic that is potentially more vulnerable to Figure 23: Social Vulnerability Index map Figure 24: Vermont population over 65 certain events, such as extreme heat.

Figure 24 the percent population over 65 by county, with the most significant population in Essex County (23%, 1,408 people). Vulnerability can also be economic. Vermont’s median household income was estimated at $56,104 in 2016, slightly above the national average of $55,322. To better account for cost of living in Vermont, Vermont’s Joint Fiscal Office develops a report biennially that determines a livable hourly wage for Vermonters4. This analysis estimates how much an individual would need to make, at a minimum, in order to live in Vermont based on a variety of family configurations and assuming employer-sponsored healthcare. The overall livable wage rate in 2016 was defined as $27,102 in individual income for a full-time worker in a two-person household without children. That equates to a household income of $54,205, which is just below the median household income for Vermont. The below table includes the various household types considered in the report and their corresponding livable wage figures.

        "SECTION 4: VERMONT PROFILE & HAZARD ASSESSMENT Climate Change Over the past several decades, there has been a marked increase in the frequency and severity of weather- related disasters, both globally and nationally. Most notably, the Earth has experienced a 1°F rise in temperature, which has far-reaching impacts on weather patterns and ecosystems. This statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended period (typically decades or longer), is known as climate change5. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5°F to 10°F over the next century, which will affect different regions in various ways over time. Impacts will also directly relate to the ability of different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change6. Increasing temperatures are forecasted to have significant impacts on weather-related disasters, which will also increase risk to life, economy and quality of life, critical infrastructure and natural ecosystems. The IPCC notes that the range of published evidence indicates that the costs associated with net damages of climate change are likely to be significant and will increase over time. It is therefore imperative that recognition of a changing climate be incorporated into all planning processes when preparing for and responding to weather-related emergencies and disasters. Most of the natural hazards identified below are likely to be exacerbated by changes in climate, either directly or indirectly. This section begins to review changes in our global and regional climate, which are further addressed in the hazard profiles, including: • Precipitation: Inundation Flooding & Fluvial Erosion; Drought; Wildfire; Landslides; Snow Storm & Ice Storm • Temperature: Extreme Cold; Extreme Heat; Drought; Wildfire; Invasive Species; Infectious Disease; Snow Storm & Ice Storm • Snow Cover: Snow Storm & Ice Storm; Drought; Wildfire The National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) reports that global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment: glaciers are shrinking, sea ice is disappearing, sea level rise is accelerating, heat waves are occurring more frequently and intensely, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted, and trees are flowering sooner. Though climate change is expected to have global reach, the impacts differ by region. While the southwestern United States is expected to experience increased heat, wildfire, drought and insect outbreaks, the northeastern region is predicted to experience increases in heat waves, downpours and flooding. Accordingly, consideration of climate change was identified as a key guiding principle of the 2018 SHMP, addressed in each of the pertinent hazard profiles and incorporated into all relevant mitigation actions. 5 http://www.ipcc.ch/ 44 6 https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/ pmeT mumixaM egarevA Years Average Minimum Temp Vermont’s Annual Maximum and Minimum Temperatures (1960-2015) 58.0 44 54.8 40 51.6 36 48.4 32 45.2 42.0 28 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Figure 25: Vermont’s annual maximum and minimum temperatures (1960-2015) Data Source: climatechange.vermont.gov",

        "SECTION 4: VERMONT PROFILE & HAZARD ASSESSMENT Since 1960, the average annual maximum temperature in Vermont increased about 0.4°F per decade, while the average minimum temperature rose at 0.6°F per decade (Figure 25). Similarly, the average annual precipitation has risen 0.7” per decade since 1895 and 1.5” per decade since 19607 (Figure 26), suggesting increasing trends in both temperature and precipitation. According to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, the average annual precipitation in the United States has increased by approximately 5%8. Of particular note, the Assessment also identifies the northern U.S. as being more likely to experience above average precipitation in the winter and spring, with even wetter conditions expected under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. In addition to higher annual precipitation in both the observed record and projected models, the northeastern United States is also projected to experience more frequent, heavier rainfall events. Since 1991, the incidence of these heavy precipitation events has been 30% above average9. Another climate change concern in Vermont is the potential for climate refugees. As portions of the U.S. become more arid and as sea levels continue to rise, Vermont may begin to see significant increases in population. One study on sea-level rise displacement projects over 4,000 migrants to Vermont from across the U.S., most predominately in Chittenden County. This study does not account for people moving from increasingly arid areas within the U.S. or from outside of the U.S., which may also increase net immigration. Based on the unpredictable nature and potential impact of an influx of climate refugees into the State, the Steering Committee decided to acknowledge climate refugees as a potential future hazard facing Vermont, to be reassessed during the next SHMP update. HAZARD ASSESSMENT A risk assessment is used to measure the potential loss of life, personal injury, economic impact, and property damage resulting from natural hazards by analyzing the vulnerability of people, the built environment, the economy and the natural environment. VEM staff used several methods to identify risks in Vermont, including the evaluation of historical data, consideration of changing climate trends, and feedback from stakeholders. This examination involved an extensive review of natural disasters in Vermont, both declared and undeclared. Man-made and technological hazards are covered extensively in the 2018 Vermont State Emergency Management Plan (SEMP), which follows a risk assessment methodology similar to that used in this Plan. Accordingly, the following sections of the risk assessment identify the natural hazards that Vermonters can expect to face over the next fifty years and beyond, and the mitigation strategies section reviews the actions underway or planned to address these hazards and risks. As noted in the 2013 SHMP, and confirmed again in this 2018 SHMP, the natural hazards not incorporated are coastal erosion, expansive soils, Karst topography, sinkholes, tsunamis and volcanoes. These hazards are considered non-significant, unlikely hazards in Vermont and therefore do not warrant extensive review and consideration in this Plan. Table 19 explains how each hazard addressed in the 2013 SHMP was considered in this Plan. Hazard Events One of the most significant changes from the 2013 Plan to the 2018 Plan is the way hazards are assessed. Instead of continuing to view hazards as events (e.g. hurricanes), the 2018 SHMP assesses the impacts of events (e.g. inundation flooding, fluvial erosion, and wind as impacts of a hurricane event), as it is the impacts, not the events, that can be mitigated. Table 15 represents the initial analysis of hazard events by the Steering Committee, which informed the creation of the hazard impact assessment. 7 http://climatechange.vermont.gov/our-changing-climate/dashboard/more-annual-precipitation 8 https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/precipitation-change 9 https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/heavy-downpours-increasing 46",

        "SECTION 4: VERMONT PROFILE & HAZARD ASSESSMENT Table 18: Causal Relationships Between Hazard Impacts The hazards and explanations of their relative probability and impact scores are detailed in the individual hazards assessment sections below. While these hazards are profiled individually, this Plan and the hazard assessment sections recognize that hazards do not occur in silos; many of the hazards are inter-related and often occur in tandem. To highlight the most significant relationships, the fluvial erosion and inundation flooding assessments were combined, as well as the ice and snow storm assessments. Each individual hazard assessment section also references the other pertinent hazards and their content, when applicable. Beyond the potential of simultaneous occurrence, several of the hazards also have the potential to cause other hazards. Causal relationships are identified in Table 18 (with causal hazards identified in green and resulting hazards identified in blue) and further addressed in pertinent hazard assessment sections. Combined with the projected increases in both precipitation and temperature, this assessment highlights the more significant compounding impacts that Vermont can anticipate in the future due to climate change. 48 yradnoceS drazaH tcapmI )tluseR( noisorE laivulF gnidoolF notiadnunI ecI wonS dniW taeH dloC thguorD sedilsdnaL erfidliW ekauqhtraE seicepS evisavnI esaesiD suoticefnI liaH Primary Hazard (Causal) Fluvial Erosion Inundation Flooding Ice Snow Wind Heat Cold Drought Landslides Wildfire Earthquake Invasive Species Infectious Disease Hail Table 19: Hazard Assessment Changes from the 2013 SHMP Hazards Addressed in 2013 Hazards Addressed in 2018 Flooding and Fluvial Erosion Inundation Flooding; Fluvial Erosion Terrorism Man-made hazards removed.

        "2018 Vermont State Hazard Mitigation Plan - Approved 11/17/18 Jurisdictional Vulnerability In conjunction with the risk assessment, VEM staff conducted a vulnerability assessment, which predicts the extent of damage that may result from a hazard event of a given intensity in a given area and considers damage to the existing and future built environment, the natural environment, and populations within Vermont. Vulnerability was determined by identifying the threats posed to people, property, the environment, and the economy. Hazard-specific vulnerability is detailed further in the individual hazard profiles. Though a small state, Vermont’s topography and mountainous setting can result in geographic isolation during severe storms, which can have significant localized impacts. A localized storm can drop a significant amount of water into a small watershed, devastating one town or cutting it off from the rest of the State, while causing no damage to an adjacent town on the other side of a mountain. The mountainous areas in Vermont vulnerable to these phenomena are numerous. Because of the steep mountain topography, damage from frequently occurring extreme weather events in any specific location may occur often or only once in a lifetime, which makes it difficult to plan for and responding to events. Coupled with this topographic isolation, the rural nature of the State can also result in isolation from necessary emergency response efforts. Most communities in Vermont have an identified local Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and/or shelter for its residents, should an event warrant their opening and often require a back- up energy source, typically in the form of generators. In order to keep these critical facilities functioning in times of need, VEM is regularly contacted for equipment and training requests and financial assistance. Other critical facilities that have applied for funding through the State are wastewater treatment plants and fire departments, which require back-up energy sources during events that may result in community-wide power loss (e.g. flooding, wind storm, ice/snow storm), or which require flood-proofing to reduce vulnerability to flood damage. Jurisdictional Risk Assessments: In an effort to validate the risk assessment completed by the Steering Committee, and as one of the metrics used to assess local vulnerability, VEM staff asked RPCs to rank the same list of hazards based on the perceived Table 20: Hazard Assessment Ranking by Regional Planning Commission Hazard Impact Average ACRPC BCRC CCRPC CVRPC LCPC NRPC NVDA RRPC SWCRPC TRORC WRC Inundation Flooding 2.2 9 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 Fluvial Erosion 2.3 3 2 1 2 4 3 5 1 2 1 1 Snow 4.5 12 3 4 3 1 5 2 7 3 6 3 Ice 4.6 1 9 6 4 5 2 3 4 9 3 5 Wind 5.1 2 4 3 6 6 4 6 3 6 4 12 Cold 7.4 17 8 5 5 3 13 4 5 4 10 10 Invasive Species 8.0 4 6 10 10 9 11 13 8 -- 5 4 Landslides 8.4 7 12 13 8 7 6 8 10 7 8 6 Wildfire 8.8 6 11 9 7 11 9 10 13 5 9 7 Drought 9.3 11 7 11 12 10 8 9 11 8 7 8 Hail 9.5 10 14 12 9 8 7 7 6 11 11 9 Infectious Disease 10.0 5 5 7 14 12 10 12 12 -- 12 11 Heat 11.1 8 10 8 13 13 14 11 9 10 13 13 Earthquake 13.1 12 13 14 11 14 12 14 14 12 14 14 49",

The report was developed to help Vermont communities better manage their flood risk and included an analysis that defined the top 32 communities where flooding risk is high, based on economic activity, at-risk infrastructure, and at-risk non-residential buildings. ACCD completed more detailed analyses for the top six communities, for which projects were defined that would reduce vulnerability and prioritize investment: Barre City and Town, Brandon, Brattleboro, Enosburg Village and Town, and Woodstock. In additional to these top communities, many of the priority areas have seen increased investment in mitigation work, as noted Table 23.

This assessment, which included all State-owned and leased properties, considered both criticality of the buildings’ functions and the vulnerability of the structures based on location. As the two most significant hazards identified in this Plan, the BGS risk assessment project focused primarily on fluvial erosion and flood inundation vulnerability. Further, assessing risk based on these hazards was fairly straightforward, as BGS could access both State and FEMA mapping data specific to fluvial erosion and inundation flooding. Using these data, BGS assessed vulnerability of an individual structure according to its proximity to the FEMA-mapped 100- and 500-yr floodplains, as well as the river corridor. An overall vulnerability score was assigned to each structure using a point system outlined in the Appendix to Section 3. Structures were then assessed according to their criticality to the following State functions: • Emergency Operations • Government Operations • Public Safety • Public Health • Public Service • Economic Activity • Cultural Resources 53",
        "SECTION 4: VERMONT PROFILE & HAZARD ASSESSMENT BGS then used the scores for criticality and vulnerability to determine building prioritization for developing mitigation measures. The risk assessment also includes information on each building’s current function, construction type and year, number of floors, building replacement cost, cost of personal property and cost of computer equipment. A detailed description of this risk assessment, prioritization process and alternatives analysis for the top priority State-owned structures can be found in the Appendix to Section 3. Though the BGS project focused primarily on fluvial erosion and inundation flooding, the data acquired are pertinent to all natural hazards profiled in this Plan that could impact State-owned or leased structures. That is, a building’s replacement cost will be the same regardless of what hazard was responsible for its destruction. Similarly, a building’s criticality score does not differ hazard-to-hazard. Further, without high fidelity hazard mapping data for all natural hazards, determining true vulnerability of a structure based on proximity to a clearly delineated hazard area is very difficult. The full list of all State-owned buildings and their replacement costs as defined above in is the Appendix to Section 4. 54"
