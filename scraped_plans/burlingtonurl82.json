Climate Change and hunger: Estimating costs of adaptation in the agrifood system. International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington D.C. 31. An agricultural activity provides climate co-benefits if it promotes mitigation or adaptation. It promotes agricultural mitigation through efforts to reduce or avoid GHG emissions and/or enhance carbon sequestration. The activity fosters adaptation if it reduces the vulnerability of people or the agricultural and food system to the impacts of climate change and risks related to climate variability, by maintaining or increasing adaptive capacity and resilience. 32.

Extracting the data for ODA between 2010 to 2019 received by African countries, the adaptation investments were calculated considering investments that were screened and had principal or significant focus on climate adaptation. 26. The ND-GAIN Index indicates countries’ vulnerability to climate change in combina- tion with readiness to improve resilience. The data used for this analysis presents the vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) of the infrastructure sector for countries in Africa for the year of 2018. 27.

The World Bank economic projections are generated using the Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS), which is a quantitative, engineering-based software model that integrates expertise from researchers in various disciplines, including engineering, architecture, economics, and development. The analysis tool can be used to understand climate impacts on both current and future infrastructure, including roads and bridges. See Cervigni, R., Losos, A., Chinowsky, P. & Neumann, J.E. eds (2017). Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Africa’s Infrastructure: The Roads and Bridges Sector. World Bank, Washington D.C. 30. PIDA+ represents the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) plus an additional 261 road network investment projects across 30 African countries. 31. The lifetime cost of each road segment was analyzed using a stressor-response method to evaluate, relative to a baseline of historical climate, the incremental cost attributable to climate change. The World Bank assumes that the roads are built to historical climate standards. When historical standards are exceeded, damages are incurred through increased maintenance activities necessary to preserve the road for its original design lifespan. Roads were classified as ‘paved’ (bitumen) or ‘gravel’ surface. 32. Cervigni, R., Losos, A., Chinowsky, P. & Neumann, J.E. eds (2017).

Climate Change and hunger: Estimating costs of adaptation in the agrifood system. International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington D.C. 31. An agricultural activity provides climate co-benefits if it promotes mitigation or adaptation. It promotes agricultural mitigation through efforts to reduce or avoid GHG emissions and/or enhance carbon sequestration. The activity fosters adaptation if it reduces the vulnerability of people or the agricultural and food system to the impacts of climate change and risks related to climate variability, by maintaining or increasing adaptive capacity and resilience. 32.

The OECD.Stat Creditor Reporting Systems (CRS) classifies ODA according to the screening for climate adaptation within four categories: not screened; screened and with significant focus; screened and with principal focus; and screened with no focus. Extracting the data for ODA between 2010 to 2019 received by African countries, the adaptation investments were calculated considering investments that were screened and had principal or significant focus on climate adaptation. 26. The ND-GAIN Index indicates countries’ vulnerability to climate change in combina- tion with readiness to improve resilience. The data used for this analysis presents the vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) of the infrastructure sector for countries in Africa for the year of 2018. 27.

The World Bank economic projections are generated using the Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS), which is a quantitative, engineering-based software model that integrates expertise from researchers in various disciplines, including engineering, architecture, economics, and development. The analysis tool can be used to understand climate impacts on both current and future infrastructure, including roads and bridges. See Cervigni, R., Losos, A., Chinowsky, P. & Neumann, J.E. eds (2017). Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Africa’s Infrastructure: The Roads and Bridges Sector. World Bank, Washington D.C. 30. PIDA+ represents the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) plus an additional 261 road network investment projects across 30 African countries. 31. The lifetime cost of each road segment was analyzed using a stressor-response method to evaluate, relative to a baseline of historical climate, the incremental cost attributable to climate change. The World Bank assumes that the roads are built to historical climate standards. When historical standards are exceeded, damages are incurred through increased maintenance activities necessary to preserve the road for its original design lifespan. Roads were classified as ‘paved’ (bitumen) or ‘gravel’ surface. 32. Cervigni, R., Losos, A., Chinowsky, P. & Neumann, J.E. eds (2017).
