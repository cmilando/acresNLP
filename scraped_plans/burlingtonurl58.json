This is reflected in the current U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, which allocates over 25 percent of available points for reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with building systems, transportation, water, waste, and construction materials (U.S. Green Building Council, 2008). By definition, greenhouse gas emission reductions are climate change mitigation. Green buildings should include both mitigation and adaptation strategies if we hope to shape the built environment in a way that is both responsive and resilient to future climate extremes. While LEED does not require climate change adaptation strategies to achieve certification, this report summarizes current technical and scientific data on the impacts of climate change on the built environment in an effort to support the work of building professionals in this emerging area of concern and to inform the selection of strategies and approaches. Within this document, we identify climate-related vulnerabilities at the regional level and prioritize design, construction, and operation strategies that will increase resilience and facilitate climate adaptation. The mission of the USGBC is to enable an environmentally and socially responsible, healthy, and prosperous environment that improves quality of life. Following the formation of the USGBC in 1993, the organization's members quickly realized that the sustainable building industry needed a transparent system to define and measure \"green buildings.\" The LEED rating system provides a third-party certification of buildings and neighborhoods designed to improve performance in energy savings, water efficiency, CO emissions reduction, improved indoor 2 environmental quality, stewardship of resources and sensitivity to environmental impacts. The LEED rating system has been modified over time in order to continue the advancement of green building performance. The most recent version, LEED Version 3.0, was launched in 2009 and provided a significant update to the LEED program. This report on climate adaptation strategies and other documents such as the Core Concepts Guide continue to advance green building practice and provide USGBC members with timely and accurate information. 51. Executive Summary The USGBC has been active in addressing climate change since the early days of LEED. These efforts have focused on guiding green building professionals toward reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of a project, thus mitigating the contribution of the project to global climate change. However, world climate change experts such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have indicated that the world will almost certainly experience some degree of climate change no matter how quickly greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. This makes climate adaptation necessary. Because climate change is related to human behaviors, uncertainty remains around the degree of change and types of impact. The points of uncertainty are described in Appendix A: Key Terms. As green building professionals, we need to understand the probable impacts of climate change on the built environment and to incorporate appropriate adaptation strategies into our practices so that the environments we design, build, and manage today will be suitable for a range of uncertain futures. While climate has always been integrated into the building professions, our codes, standards, and practices typically assume that the future will be similar to the past. Climate change requires that we update these codes, standards, and practices with the best available knowledge. Planning to adapt to the effects of climate change in the built environment involves first understanding how the regional climate is likely to change. Projections of change, by U.S. region, are included in Appendix B: Regional Climate Change Impacts. By understanding the probable impacts, design teams can set modified performance goals, diving deeper into project-specific changes at the building or neighborhood level, and then select strategies to increase the resilience and adaptive capacity of each project. The body of this report summarizes the most recent research on the likely impacts of climate change at various scales: regional, neighborhood, and site or building. We report predicted climate changes by region, and wherever possible we present a range of predicted future characteristics in the categories of temperature, precipitation, coastlines, air quality, pests, and fires. We also explore how climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts at all scales interact synergistically, with a focus on how green building professionals can approach adaptation in the built environment. 6Appendix C contains a set of specific strategies that can be used to enhance resilience and provide adaptive benefits. The strategies are divided into six categories: 1) envelope, 2) siting and landscape, 3) heating, cooling, and lighting, 4) water and waste, 5) equipment, and 6) process and operation. Several of the strategies presented are “no-regrets” strategies. A no- regrets strategy will generate social and/or economic benefits whether or not climate change occurs. A \"resilient\" strategy will allow a system to absorb disturbances such as increased precipitation or flooding while maintaining its structure and function. To our knowledge, this report represents one of the first attempts to compile all research on the impacts of climate change on the built environment, and to link impacts with strategies for addressing them. The information and strategies presented here provide a solid baseline from which green building professionals can begin to address climate change adaptation in their projects. However, there is a great need for further research. Not all U.S. regions have received significant attention from climate change researchers. To date, the research has focused disproportionately on the heavily populated coastal areas. Of even greater concern is the significant lack of work focused on connecting climate research with practice. While this report represents a first step towards bridging this gap, building professionals will need significant future guidance to address the sizable climate change challenge. This report concludes with an analysis of current research needs and suggests resources to develop to bridge the research- practice divide. 72. Introduction A changing climate presents a challenge to the planners and designers of the built environment. Building professionals will need to incorporate strategies that consider future climate change within their region. This contrasts with the current practice of basing building and neighborhood design decisions on historic climate data. While ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) encourages cities to plan for the effects of climate change by creating a comprehensive climate adaptation plan, building professionals need their own framework and tools for incorporating climate adaptation strategies in their projects. This section of the report describes climate adaptation planning, the primary ways that climate currently influences building and neighborhood design at a variety of scales, and the steps for incorporating climate adaptation strategies into a project. The Challenge of a Changing Climate The IPCC and the EPA report that some degree of climate change will occur regardless of whether we begin to significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The effect of climate change on neighborhoods and buildings will depend on the sensitivity and adaptability of these systems (US EPA 2011). Adaptation is defined as the adjustment of our built environment, infrastructure, and social systems in response to actual or expected climatic events or their effects. Adaptation includes responses to reduce harm or to capture benefits (IPCC 2007) as well as resilience, the ability of a system to absorb a climatic event without failing or changing state. Until now, green building practice has focused primarily on lessening the built environment’s contribution to climate change through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This is still a critical role for green building, as residential and commercial buildings contribute approximately 37% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States (U.S. Energy Information Administration 2009). The next step is to understand the impact of climate change on the built environment and to incorporate appropriate adaptation strategies into green building practice so that the environments we design, build, and manage today will be suitable for a range of uncertain futures. 8Emissions trends help us to understand why the climate is changing, but it is difficult to predict the long-term climate impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. Making exact predictions of how global average temperatures will change over time is complicated by factors such as population growth, economic growth, technological development, and energy efficiency improvements (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). These four factors result from human behaviors and policies and complicate any series of calculations. For green building professionals, an integral part of adapting to climate change is the continued effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the built environment while increasing adaptation strategies. Mitigation and adaptation strategies should not be seen as an \"either/or\" proposition. For example, renewable energy strategies will both reduce a building’s dependency on the electrical grid and reduce carbon emissions and potentially make the building more resilient to power outages. Therefore, green building strategies can often reduce greenhouse gas emissions while building resilience to the effects of climate change by enabling future adaptation. The Role of Climate in Building and Neighborhood Design Climate data is used to inform a number of different decisions in the design, construction, and operation of the built environment. These decisions include the selection of systems for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), tree and plant species for landscaping, and appropriate building materials. Currently, climate-related decisions are based on historic climate data and past trends, with the inherent assumption that the climate will remain relatively stable in the future. Table 1 summarizes some of the ways climate data informs design decisions. Today’s building professionals should consider climate projections in conjunction with historic trends and current conditions as they make design, construction, operations and maintenance decisions. 9Table 1: Examples of How Climate Data Informs Decisions in the Built Environment System Climate Considerations Implications HVAC & The size of a heating and cooling Designing HVAC systems based on Building system (and its associated energy historic weather data will make Energy use) is estimated using typical building systems vulnerable to Simulations meteorological year (TMY) data. future changes in climate.

Climate change will also shift plant hardiness zones northward, affecting plant selection. This report provides information and resources for addressing climate change impacts in the built environment. Appendix B summarizes projected regional climate impacts and illustrates anticipated effects of climate change in nine geographical regions of the United States. Once climate change impacts are understood, a project team can evaluate the range of possible adaptation strategies to increase its system’s resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change. The following sections of this report outline the steps for different scales and stages of planning and design. 10Climate Adaptation Planning at the City Level Primary Resources— Adaptation and Resilience Many cities are engaging in comprehensive 1. ICLEI – Local Governments for climate adaptation planning. These cities range in size Sustainability provides technical and geographic location from small cities threatened by and policy assistance, software training, climate expertise, sea level rise in Alaska to larger cities with vulnerable, information services, and peer networking to help members aging infrastructure such as Boston, Massachusetts. In build capacity, share knowledge and implement sustainable 2010, ICLEI introduced a process for climate adaptation development and climate protection at the local level. As planning, similar to its process for climate change part of their climate change mitigation (ICLEI 2011). The five milestones of guidance, ICLEI issued a document entitled \"Preparing for ICLEI’s climate adaptation planning process, listed Climate Change: A Guidebook for Local, Regional, and State below, illustrate the broad scope and comprehensive Governments\" in 2007.

Monitor and reevaluate resiliency While different in scale from climate adaptation planning at the project level, a city-level plan is an important resource for understanding local impacts and identifying city-wide priorities for increased resiliency. For example, if a city’s combined sewer and stormwater system is already overloaded and climate change impacts include increased precipitation, onsite stormwater management should be considered to increase a project's resiliency to storm events. 11Incorporating Climate Adaptation into New Buildings and Neighborhoods Green building professionals can integrate climate adaptation strategies into a project by using the following four-step process. The existing LEED Rating System and the LEED Reference Guides complement this process by identifying greenhouse gas mitigation strategies. Professionals aware of the predicted climate change impacts for their project’s region can set performance goals for the future climate. For example, a project in a region expected to experience more intense rain events might set a goal of managing all stormwater runoff onsite. The team would then analyze predicted changes in precipitation for the region under multiple scenarios and select strategies that would achieve the goal throughout the design life and under multiple precipitation scenarios. 1. Understand regional impacts: Identify climate impacts for the project’s region. 2. Modify performance goals: Incorporate possible impacts into performance goals for the building or neighborhood. 3. Determine the range of effects on the local built environment: Refine regional impacts to a smaller scale; anticipate how climate changes are likely to manifest in the local environment; present design team with a range of possible scenarios. 4. Select a combination of no-regrets and resilient adaptation strategies: Choose strategies that enable the project to achieve and maintain performance goals, under all possible futures, for the expected life of the project. Incorporating Climate Adaptation into Existing Buildings Green building and climate adaptation strategies must be applied to existing buildings as well as new building projects. Borrowing from the ICLEI process, the steps below describe how a project team can integrate adaptation strategies to existing buildings and sites. 1. Understand regional impacts: Identify climate impacts for the building’s region. 2. Evaluate current operation and maintenance targets: Understand how the maintenance and operations perform under current peak climate conditions. 3. Conduct a scenario analysis: Analyze how the building will respond to projected climate impacts, modeling different system options under a variety of climatic conditions. 124. Implement adaptation strategies: Install adaptation strategies that provide passive or efficient responses to more extreme climate events in order to maintain occupant comfort while preventing increased energy use.

Lowe, Foster, and Winkelman 2009). The document can be downloaded from the CCAP website at http://www.ccap.org/docs/resources/674/Urban_Climate_Adaptation-FINAL_CCAP 6- 9-09.pdf. 133. Understanding Climate Change: Global, Regional, and Local Impacts The global climate is changing and the early effects have already been observed (USGCRP 2009). Key reports from the IPCC, the USGCRP, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) analyze the forces behind climate change and predict the future climate we are likely to face. Understanding these drivers is the first step toward understanding what a change in climate means for green building professionals operating at the city, neighborhood, and building levels. This section of the report provides a broad overview of the science of climate change and describes the impacts expected at the regional, neighborhood, and building scales. Appendix A complements this section by defining key terms used in the literature. Appendix B lists specific impacts for each region of the United States, and outlines related impacts on the built environment. Greenhouse Gases The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is driving the increase in global temperature and other climatic changes. There are both natural and anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases. Transportation, commercial and residential building, and industrial sources all contribute significant amounts of greenhouse gases. In the U.S. they contribute 36%, 37%, and 28%, respectively (U.S. Energy Information Administration 2009). These heat-trapping gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, tropospheric ozone, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), water vapor, and aerosols (Forster et al. 2007). A low level of radiated heat from greenhouse gases is a natural phenomenon. However, since the industrial revolution, which began in the mid-1700s, concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO ), methane (CH ), and nitrous oxide (N O) in 2 4 2 the atmosphere have increased significantly and caused an increase in global average temperature (USGCRP, 2009). Today, atmospheric concentrations of these three gases are higher than at any time in recorded human history and are increasing at exponential rates, as illustrated in Figure 1. 14Figure 1: Concentrations of Atmospheric Greenhouse Gases over the Last 2000 Years (Source: http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-2-1-figure-1.html) Of these gases, CO is the greatest total contributor to warmer temperatures because of its 2 high concentration in the atmosphere, strong radiative forcing (restriction of outgoing infrared radiation), and long life span (Forster et al. 2007). Atmospheric concentrations of CO are 2 believed to have remained between 200 and 300 parts per million (ppm) for 800,000 years, but then rapidly increased to approximately 387 ppm in recent years (The World Bank 2010). CO 2 levels have increased by 35 percent since the start of the industrial revolution (USGCRP 2009), and concentrations continue to increase at an accelerated rate in the atmosphere (The World Bank, 2010), where CO persists for up to 200 years (Snover et al. 2007). 2 The atmospheric concentration of CO is affected by the natural cycle of release and 2 uptake. Oceans, vegetation, and soil can absorb CO . However, this “carbon sequestration” is 2 only temporary, and these “sinks” may lose capacity as the climate continues to warm. For example, thawing permafrost will likely release CO that has been tored for thousands of years, 2 potentially initiating a feedback loop in which more carbon is released to the atmosphere (USGCRP 2009). There is a growing consensus in global policy and scientific circles that stabilizing emissions at a level associated with a 2ºC (3.6ºF) average warming is required to prevent the 15most severe impacts of climate change to human and natural systems (The World Bank 2010). In order to stay within this 2ºC limit, in the long term, CO concentrations need to stabilize near 2 current levels (USGCRP 2009). To help envision the range of possible futures, the IPCC developed 40 baseline emissions scenarios showing different paths for greenhouse gas emissions from 2000 to 2100, based on variations in climate change factors. These scenarios assume no international policies to mitigate emissions (Nakicenovic et al. 2000) and they indicate that annual emissions could increase or decrease from today’s level of approximately 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO e) 2 to anywhere between 30 and 140 gigatons. Temperature increases associated with these emission levels range from 1 to 7 degrees Celsius (Bernstein et al. 2007). Figure 2: Scenarios for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from 2000 to 2100 (Source: http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/figure-spm-5.html) 16Observed and Predicted Global Climate Change Impacts The early effects of global climate change can already be observed in changes to weather related hazards, hydrology and water resources, coastal processes, biological systems, agriculture, forestry, and human health (C. Rosenzweig et al. 2007). Some examples of observed effects include (relative to historical norms): • Higher temperatures • Increase in the number and size of drought-prone areas • Higher intensity of storms • Sea level rise • Accelerated rates of coastal erosion • Increased water salinity and suspended solids • Increased river runoff The effects of climate change will likely be more extreme than what we have observed so far. With each additional increase in the global mean annual temperature, the severity of effects are likely to worsen. However, the impacts of climate change will not be equally distributed among all locations (USGCRP 2009). Because of this, it is important for green building professionals to understand how climate change will impact the regions where they work. U.S. Regional Climate Change Impacts Understanding how global climate change is likely to affect the region where a project is located is an important first step in anticipating effects on the built environment, modifying project outcomes, and selecting appropriate response strategies. Regional climate impacts fall into six general categories: 1. Temperature 2. Water/Precipitation 3. Coastal Effects 4. Air Quality 5. Pests 6. Fire 17These impacts have been the topic of significant research, compiled most recently by the USGCRP in 2009, and reported in detail by region in Appendix B of this report. The direction and degree of these impacts vary significantly by region and will result in a diverse set of challenges across different regions of the U.S. The USGCRP divides the nation into eight regions (plus coasts) as indicated in Figure 3. In this report, we include coastal impacts within the regions where they are located. Figure 3: Regions of the United States (Source: http://www.globalchange.gov/) Rising average temperatures are predicted in all U.S. regions and will influence many other climate change impacts, such as precipitation patterns. Higher temperatures will likely lead to more extremely hot days (over 90 degrees Fahrenheit) and an increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves. In many regions, these effects will likely be felt most during the summer months. Precipitation patterns are also likely to change as a result of higher temperatures, but the effects will vary widely by region. The Southwest is likely to see a decrease in overall precipitation and to experience longer, more frequent, and more severe droughts. Meanwhile, the Midwest is likely to experience less frequent but more intense storms, and an associated increased risk of flooding. In general, researchers are much less certain how climate change will impact precipitation patterns than average temperatures (USGCRP 2009). 18Coastal areas are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to rising sea levels, falling lake levels, and more intense tropical storms. As temperatures rise and polar ice melt accelerates, sea levels are predicted to rise, resulting in potentially disastrous effects for low-lying areas. Of particular concern is the vulnerability of coastal areas to inundation from storm surges during severe tropical storms and hurricanes. Rising sea levels will not affect all coastal areas equally. In general, the Atlantic Coast and Gulf Coast are more vulnerable due to their relatively flat topography and high rates of land subsidence in some areas. Sea level rise is less of a concern in some parts of the Pacific Northwest where land is rising due to tectonic activity. In the Midwest, inland and Great Lakes water levels are predicted to decline due to reductions in winter ice cover and increased evaporation, despite a predicted increase in total rainfall (USGCRP 2009). Climate change will likely result in many more diverse and region-specific impacts including increased risk of wildfires, invasions of pests, and degradation of surface air quality. These and other impacts are often linked. For example, warmer winter temperatures may be contributing to the death of Pacific Northwest pine forests as more insects survive winter conditions (Ryan 1991). The increased number of dead trees within the pine forests may also result in more frequent and intense wildfires that could threaten nearby buildings and degrade air quality. While changes in average precipitation and temperature patterns are important information for projecting impacts, the primary concern for green building practice is the impact that increasing severity and variability of weather patterns and climate will have on the local built environment. Appendix B contains important quantitative estimates of change in these affected categories through the end of the century. Please refer to this resource for more details on region-specific climate change predictions. Whenever possible, we report numbers as a range of possible changes. The most relevant numbers for design will be the upper and lower bounds, which represent the most extreme possibilities within the plausible range. Determining Impacts at the Neighborhood or Building Level Climate is the long-term average weather conditions of a region or place. Regional climate change predictions are useful for understanding general changes in weather and climate- 19related conditions, but more information is often needed to determine how these forces will affect a specific site or project. Local features (like a mountain or a large lake) can significantly influence weather patterns, and local features such as topography or distance from a coast can have important implications for climate change predictions (Wilby et al. 2004). Two types of resources are available to green building professionals who seek finer-grained detail on climate change impacts: downscaled climate models and historical analysis of severe weather events. When available, downscaled state/local climate change assessments are the best sources of this information. Downscaling is a statistical process used to convert global or regional models to smaller geographies and to account for local features. Climate scientists have only recently begun producing downscaled climate models at the local level with sufficient accuracy to be useful to building professionals. Few cities have devoted the significant resources required to create locally downscaled climate change projections – instead, local climate action plans usually rely on the same regional sources cited by the USGCRP and used in this report. Some states (e.g. California) have developed resources that may reduce the uncertainties reported in the regional assessments. Finer resolution data at the metropolitan level may be available in the near future, and these data may further narrow uncertainty about climate impacts. However, some uncertainty will always exist because of natural weather pattern variability and because many climate change drivers are influenced by human behavior. Regardless of whether downscaled local climate change predictions are available, additional work may be needed to assess neighborhood- and site-level vulnerability. One strategy is to use local knowledge of recent events. When ICLEI (see section 2.3) works with local governments to help them plan for sustainability and climate change adaptation, it recommends focusing on past extreme weather events and anecdotal accounts. When combined with regional climate change predictions, local historical accounts enable governments to envision how prepared they would need to be to respond to similar future events that are more frequent or more severe (ICLEI-Canada, 2010). Green building professionals should follow a similar process but tailor their approach to the specific concerns at the neighborhood or building level. 20Additional Resources 1.

The 2010 World Development Report says that advanced countries, which produced most of the greenhouse gas emissions of the past, must act to shape our climate future. The report argues that if developed countries act now, a \"climate-smart\" world is feasible, and the costs for getting there will be high but still manageable: http://go.worldbank.org/45FTJL7UP0. 3. The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) coordinates and integrates federal research on changes in the global environment and their implications for society. The USGCRP began as a presidential initiative in 1989 and was mandated by Congress in the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-606), which called for \"a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.\" For more information from the program, see: http://www.globalchange.gov/. 4.

Climate Change Impacts on the Built Environment Distinct climate change impacts are associated with the regional, city, neighborhood, and site scales. This section of the report reviews literature that focuses on anticipated climate change impacts and the quantitative effects of these impacts on the built environment. Given the regional nature of both climate change impacts and urban systems and development, further localized research is needed on the impacts and effects of climate change on the built environment. Regional Scale Impacts The regional scale involves the broader urban area(s) and the various systems implemented in support of the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the area. While numerous elements are susceptible to climate change impacts, discussions of regional effects tend to focus on energy, water, and transportation systems. These three regional systems provide cities, neighborhoods, and buildings with essential services and permit movement and connection. Climate change will have a significant impact on the effectiveness of regional systems. More resilient regional systems will maintain efficiencies across systems and limit conflict. Energy Systems: Climate change impacts on energy systems will affect both energy supply (generation, transmission, and distribution) and demand. Given increased variability in temperature, climate change could result in a need to increase energy supply capacity (Amato, Ruth, Kirshen, and Horwitz 2005). At the regional scale, climate change impacts on the delivery of energy may affect the siting of new facilities and infrastructure and disrupt the transmission of energy (USCCSP 2008). In particular, sea level rise, land subsidence, increased storm severity, and storm surges may constrain the location of future energy infrastructure sites (Perez 2009; USCCSP 2008). The impacts of climate change on energy generation vary significantly by fuel source. However, the USCCSP states that fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation are inextricably tied to reliable and adequate supplies of water for cooling. Additionally, renewable energy sources, particularly hydroelectric and solar thermal systems, are highly dependent on water and are therefore very susceptible to climate change (USCCSP 2008). 22Climate projections indicate warming trends during both winter and summer seasons. As a result, effects on energy demand will include small reductions in space heating but substantial increases in space cooling (Crawley et al. 2008; Huang 2006; USCCSP 2008). A study of the Chicago region projects a 30 to 60 percent increase in annual Cooling Degree Days (CDD) by 2070 for lower and higher emission scenarios respectively (Perez 2009). Additionally, Franco and Sandstad (2006) find that energy models for California predict increases in annual electricity and peak load demands in all climate scenarios. In particular, the A1FI or “high emissions scenario” for the 2070 to 2099 timeframe shows an increase in annual electricity of 20.3 percent and a peak demand increase of 19.3 percent (Franco and Sanstad 2006). The resulting increase in demand, when combined with a strain on existing generation assets, may increase costs and reduce the reliability of regional energy systems. Water Systems: Existing research on the impacts of climate change on water have primarily focused at the regional level because of the size and intricacies of these systems. The primary effects of climate change on regional water systems are increasing variability in the quantity and timing of streamflow runoff, increased risk of flooding, and diminished water quality (Barlage et al. 2002; Barnett et al. 2004; Hamlet and Lettenmaier 1999; Wilby 2007). The impacts of climate change on regional water systems will intensify conflicts between essential and non-essential water uses, and require regional management to ensure an increase in the quality and reliability of water resources (Barlage et al., 2002). Water supply reliability is one of the most important and therefore most extensively researched effects of climate change on both natural systems and human populations. Projected water resource capacity is highly dependent on regional climate impacts and the existing water system balance between supply and demand. Anticipated changes in precipitation vary dramatically by region. Projections indicate increased precipitation at higher latitudes, rising intensity and frequency of low-precipitation periods for areas prone to droughts, and significant changes in runoff patterns for watersheds dependent on snow-fed rivers. Significant research has focused on climate change impacts on streamflow and water reliability at the regional scale. While a majority of the studies have focused on the western region of the United States, many of the basic tenets and lessons can be applied to areas anticipating similar climate threats. A study on the effect of climate change on water resources in 23the West concludes, “by mid-century we see that the Colorado River Reservoir System will not be able to meet all of the demands placed on it, including water supply for Southern California\" (Barlage et al. 2002). The variability in water supply levels will result in difficulty meeting domestic, industrial, and agricultural demand; maintaining energy production; and supporting natural systems. Stormwater management is a second fundamental concern when analyzing the impacts of climate change on regional water systems. The increased intensity and frequency of high- precipitation events will likely result in increased runoff and flooding (Wilby 2007). Additionally, future development locations and land use decisions play influential roles in determining future stormwater runoff impacts regionally. Analyzing future regional stormwater runoff patterns involves considering climate change impacts in conjunction with urban development patterns. One such study, performed on the Rock Creek Basin in Oregon, indicates that, given climate change projections, sprawling development patterns increase annual runoff by 5.5 percent compared to the baseline model, while a more compact development scenario results in increased annual runoff by 5.2 percent (Franczyk and Chang 2009). The researchers conclude that while regional development patterns have a significant impact on streamflow and water runoff, climate change is expected to have a greater impact on streamflow than land use change (Barlage et al. 2002; Chang 2003; Franczyk and Chang 2009). As water runoff has a strong connection to flood risk and damage in urban areas (Ashley et al. 2005), as well as impacts on the health of natural watersheds (Barlage et al. 2002), considering the future effects of climate change is extremely important. Transportation Systems: Transportation via land, air, or water plays an integral role in connecting urban areas internally and externally. Distinct climate threats exist for each transportation sector, and they vary significantly by location. Region-specific climate impacts will primarily affect transportation infrastructure. The climate change impacts of concern for transportation infrastructure include high precipitation events, extreme weather, sea level rise, thawing permafrost, and reduced ocean and lake ice cover (Transportation Research Board 2008). Therefore, climate change can affect transportation systems by decreasing reliability and safety, and by significantly increasing the cost of both operation and maintenance. 24Neighborhood Scale Impacts Neighborhoods connect individual building sites to the broader city and regional contexts. Furthermore, the neighborhood level is the primary scale at which building professionals can begin to address impacts of climate change. Because there is little existing research on the impacts of climate change at the neighborhood scale, our analysis focuses on applying information gathered through site or regional studies. In evaluating climate impacts at the neighborhood scale, the elements of location, design, and pattern are important to consider. Location is a critical issue, especially in regards to the anticipated climate change impacts of sea level rise, increased frequency and intensity of flooding, and higher incidences of wildfires. While each of these impacts is more common in certain regions, every project team should consider these location-specific climate impacts when making development decisions. Sea Level Rise: Factors that should be considered before building in coastal areas include anticipated sea level rise, potential changes in storm surge, and land subsidence. The range of projections, both high and low, for anticipated rises in sea level should be evaluated for specific locations. While general changing sea level projections are valuable, knowledge of local geology and tidal patterns is necessary for a full understanding of potential risks. For example, a study of the potential impact of hurricanes on sea level rise reports a mean global sea level rise projection of between 19 and 60 cm, with a high emissions scenario resulting in an 80.0 cm rise (Mousavi et al. 2010). Given variability in projections and coastal systems, regional studies and research are necessary to define local effects. It is also necessary to analyze projected changes in storm surge associated with rising sea level. While changes in sea level help identify better location options, a more in-depth measure of risk relates to the potential impact of storm surge. This is especially important for areas currently (or projected to be) affected by hurricanes. Finally, research regarding land subsidence is an element in identifying the climate change risk regarding sea level rise for a specific location. An analysis of projected sea level rise, changing storm surge, and the amount of land subsidence allows for an informed decision when evaluating location choices in coastal areas. Flooding: With increasing frequency and intensity of precipitation due to climate change, the risk of flooding increases. Flood risk is assessed primarily when determining the appropriate location for a specific project or in planning for urban growth. The most effective way to begin 25accounting for the impacts of increased flooding is to identify the effect of precipitation projections on flood plain calculations and flood event probabilities. Consideration of flood risk when siting a project should identify changes in the planning of ‘at risk’ areas, and in particular how climate change will affect floodplains for 1-in-10, 1-in-50, and 1-in-100 year events. Two elements to consider when assessing climate change impacts on future flooding include changes in precipitation under future climate scenarios and changes to the landscape that could either reduce or increase stormwater run-off. Projections indicate increasingly frequent and intense precipitation events for most regions. Additionally, models taking into account land use planning processes generally show increased runoff resulting from sprawling development patterns and increased use of impervious surfaces (Marsh 2005). Therefore, the combination of more frequent and intense precipitation and continued land development will result in increased flood risk throughout urban areas (Barlage et al. 2002; Chang 2003; Franczyk and Chang 2009). Recent research predicts that flood risk will increase by a factor of at least two (Ashley et al. 2005). Furthermore, direct damage to buildings due to flooding is projected to increase by factors of 2.5, 3.8, and 9.8 for three different rivers within one watershed (Schreider, D. I. Smith, and Jakeman 2000). The variation in risk is due to the specific natural and built environment characteristics of the sub-watersheds. This example illustrates why more location-specific research will be extremely important when considering future development sites. Wildfires: A final consideration when making location decisions is the rising threat of wildfires due to changing precipitation patterns and expanding urban areas. Generally, “climate change that results in drier, warmer climates has the potential to increase fire occurrence and intensify fire behavior” (Y. Liu, Stanturf, and Goodrick 2010). In particular, the incidence of wildfires is highly linked to low-precipitation and low-snowpack climate patterns (Barnett et al. 2004). Furthermore, the sprawling nature of urban areas has led to “the rapid growth of housing in and near the wildland-urban interface (WUI), [which has led to] increases in wildfire risk to lives and structures” (Massada et al. 2009). Thus, with further anticipated growth of urban metropolitan areas, as well as projected climate change conditions that are likely to increase the frequency of wildfires, it is reasonable to assume that fire will pose a growing risk to the built environment. Design teams should consider the projected regional climate impacts that may result in more frequent and intense wildfires when locating buildings, sites, and neighborhoods. 26Neighborhood Design and Form The design and pattern of neighborhoods that combine to form our cities play an important role in amplifying or dampening climate effects. For example, neighborhood design and development patterns could help mitigate changes in heat and stormwater runoff. In particular, neighborhood design that significantly increases the amount of impervious surfaces while adding little to no vegetation will only exacerbate the effects of anticipated climate change. Research on the regional impacts of climate change identifies compact development as a means of addressing climate change impacts on the built environment. Urban Heat Island Effect: Urban heat island (UHI) effects and extreme heat events are the primary threats resulting from the increasing temperature associated with climate change. Urban neighborhood patterns have a distinct effect on the thermal comfort of local inhabitants during high heat events. Research on the UHI effect shows that higher density development exacerbates extreme heat events, resulting in additional stressors in urban areas (Coutts, Beringer, and Tapper 2010; Hamin and Gurran 2009; Harlan et al. 2006). The design of urban neighborhoods, including large areas of impervious surfaces, lack of shade-producing vegetation, lower albedo materials, and higher concentrations of waste heat sources all magnify the impact of heat events (Bowler et al. 2010; Coutts et al. 2010; Hamin and Gurran 2009; Smith and Levermore 2008; Wilby 2007). Research also indicates that higher UHI effects impact both higher density urban areas and lower density sprawling urban areas (Oke 1981; Smith and Levermore 2008; Stone, Hess, and Frumkin 2010). Higher density and compact development often result in an “urban canyon” pattern that can trap daytime heat and limit the ability of wind and cooler temperatures to reduce heat (Oke 1981; Wilby, 2007). Similar to high-density urban form, a low-density sprawling development pattern has been shown to exacerbate the UHI effect due to extensive impervious and lower albedo surfaces, and a lack of vegetation (Stone et al. 2010). While issues of thermal comfort and heat stress are primarily addressed at the building and site levels, by beginning to identify the impact of neighborhood patterns on UHI effect, a design team can achieve a more holistic approach to address the impacts of heat-related climate change. Stormwater Runoff: Extensive use of impervious surfaces in urban areas amplifies the impacts of extreme precipitation events. As high precipitation events become more frequent and 27intense, the associated impacts on urban areas and natural watersheds increase greatly. Neighborhood design and material selection have a distinct impact on the level of stormwater runoff. Specifically, largely impervious surfaces and limited vegetation dramatically decrease water's ability to infiltrate, thereby increasing runoff. The extent of the impact is supported by studies reporting that urban patterns of low-density sprawling development have a larger impact on flooding and stormwater runoff than high-density compact development (Franczyk and Chang 2009; Jacob and Winner 2009). Given anticipated changes in climate patterns, professionals should begin to consider the effect neighborhood patterns have on stormwater runoff and flooding. Site or Project Scale Impacts In assessing the impacts of climate change at the site and building level, it is important to draw connections to associated effects at the neighborhood, city, and regional scales. While climate change may have a distinct impact on the built environment at a specific level, many of the associated effects apply across scales. For instance, the primary neighborhood-level effects of increased urban heat island and stormwater runoff will influence site and building performance. Eight significant site-level impacts include landscape, water, stormwater, energy, indoor environmental quality, building materials, increased risk of flood events, and expanding pest ranges. Landscapes: Research indicates that changes in plant hardiness zones will occur as a result of increasing temperatures, more intense and frequent heat and precipitation events, and longer periods between storm events (Parmesan and Yohe 2003). A recent study on the effects of climate change on global natural systems predicts an average systematic habitat shift of 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (Ibid.). Changing precipitation patterns, length of seasons, and average ambient temperature will all be determining factors to consider for climate adapted landscape design. Plant selection will also affect habitat opportunities. A secondary issue relates to the use of greenspace in addressing stormwater runoff and urban heat effects as elements of green infrastructure. Significant research has focused on the effect of landscaping strategies on climate change impacts, particularly on-site stormwater runoff strategies and the urban heat island mitigation effects of shade and evapotranspiration (Berndtsson 2010; Bowler et al. 2010; Gill et al. 2007). Since landscape design and greenspace 28can lessen the future impacts of climate change, projected changes in landscape infrastructure design and plant species selection will be crucial site-level adaptation strategies. Water: Research assessing the impacts of climate change on water systems has had a regional focus, with little emphasis on the site level effects on human systems. To assess site impacts, our analysis focuses on the projected regional effects and studies on site level water management. At the site level, climate change will primarily affect water consumption patterns and management of stormwater runoff. Consumption Patterns: Water consumption patterns are projected to change in response to increasing temperature, more frequent and intense extreme heat events, and longer droughts (Smith, Howe, and Henderson 2009). If regional streamflow patterns change as anticipated, site level water availability will become increasingly unpredictable. Given increasing demand for and decreasing reliability of water supplies, the potential exists for longer periods of drought and growing controversy over water supply priorities (Wilby 2007). Therefore, great emphasis should be placed on site level water consumption reductions to help balance projected growth in demand with a less reliable supply. Stormwater Runoff: As discussed in the regional and neighborhood sections, climate change will lead to more intense and frequent precipitation, thereby increasing stormwater runoff. While most research focuses on the impacts of stormwater runoff at a city or regional scale, there are site level effects as well. While regional or neighborhood systems can be designed to address stormwater runoff, the primary is site level damage and a localized risk of flooding (Ashley et al. 2005). Warmer Temperatures; Increased Frequency and Intensity of Extreme Heat Events: Building level energy use is likely to change as a result of rising temperatures. As average temperatures increase, cooling degree days will also increase. Energy demands for heating will decrease slightly, but energy demands for cooling will increase significantly (USCCSP 2008), especially on extremely hot days (over 90˚F). Extremely hot days are already major drivers of energy use in buildings, and as extreme heat events become more frequent and severe, energy use will rise proportionately because increases in exterior heat and interior heat gains have a linear relationship (Coley and Kershaw 2010). 29Increasing energy demands have important implications for building design and operations. Although energy demands are not predicted to increase in the short term (Huang 2006), long-term impacts could be quite different. One study suggests that climate change could increase California's annual electricity usage by 20% by century’s end (Franco and Sanstad 2006). Such an increase would impose significantly higher costs for building operations. Designers should take care to incorporate higher cooling demands into building designs. While all buildings are likely to experience higher heating loads as a result of increasing temperatures, the degree to which they require additional energy for cooling is related to the design of the building envelope and systems (Coley and Kershaw 2010). Special consideration should be given to design solutions that do not increase building carbon emissions, such as high albedo roofs, green roofs, and enhanced building envelope strategies. Increased Vulnerability to Extreme Heat Events: The frequency and severity of extreme heat events is likely to increase significantly as a result of climate change, affecting building occupant comfort. HVAC systems are currently designed to provide sufficient cooling capacity for the historic climate pattern. If extreme heat events increase dramatically, cooling systems may not be able to continue providing sufficient power to maintain comfort levels. Designers should consider an increased frequency and intensity of extreme heat events when determining needed cooling loads. In particular, designs that allow for future expansion may be prudent. Decreased Ability For Natural Ventilation: Natural ventilation, such as opening a window, is a common way for building occupants to exercise control over personal comfort levels. Ventilation is also used as a natural supplement to forced-air cooling systems, and for low-energy night cooling of buildings. However, as both daytime and nighttime temperatures are predicted to rise, natural ventilation will be a less effective strategy for reducing indoor air temperatures in buildings. Further complicating matters, ground-level ozone concentrations are predicted to increase as daytime temperatures rise and the number of extreme heat events increases. A study of 50 U.S. cities estimated that ozone risk days will increase by 68% per year (Bell et al. 2007). The combination of rising temperatures and the human health risks related to high ozone concentrations may make traditional natural ventilation of indoor spaces a less viable strategy. A UK study estimates that London office buildings and mixed use buildings that rely on natural 30ventilation will overheat more frequently (5-25% increase for a 1960s-era office building in 2080, and 1.4-3.7% for a more modern mixed-use building in 2020). However, the same study estimated that buildings with advanced natural ventilation may experience no increase in overheating through 2080 (Hacker and Holmes 2007). Building Materials: There are few comprehensive studies on the projected impacts of climate change on building materials. However, some region specific reports focus on certain climate threats. Existing literature and reports indicate that building materials will be most affected by more intense and frequent storms, increased flooding, and changing regional pest ranges (Roberts 2008; Wilby 2007). The durability, design, and testing of building materials are primary considerations when accounting for anticipated climate change. Increased Frequency and Intensity of Storms: We can look to the extensive research on the impact of storms, primarily hurricanes in the Southeastern region of the U.S., to begin assessing the affects of climate change on building materials. A detailed report following Hurricane Ike identifies roofing and wind-driven water as primary threats to building materials. The report outlines specific roofing recommendations, including the need “to assess actual performance of roofing products and systems in order to improve material production and installation specifications.” Furthermore, recommendations regarding wind-driven water call for better water intrusion management, “through a combination of structural improvements and more realistic testing” (Institute for Business and Home Safety 2009). The report provides detailed roofing and envelope strategies to address the impacts of high wind and extreme precipitation resulting from intense storm events. While the Hurricane Ike report is a region-specific response to a single weather event, it exemplifies the type of research useful in determining the region- specific impacts of climate change on building materials. Increased Risk of Flood Events: While location choices and neighborhood patterns play an important role in alleviating flood risk, building material decisions will also be affected. In anticipation of increased site level flood risk, recommendations include choosing building materials that are more durable and resistant to water, less susceptible to water intrusions, and relatively inexpensive and easy to replace if flooding occurs (Roberts 2008). Expanding Pest Ranges: Finally, climate change will impact building materials as the warming climate is projected to increase the current climate range for insects (USCCSP 2008). 31In particular, the increased range for termite habitat will raise the risk of damage to building materials. The range for termites is projected to spread as temperatures increase, especially with anticipated shorter winter seasons when ground freezing helps eliminate termite population (Peterson,2010). Regions with limited termite populations should consider increasing pest issues and damage to wood-based building materials as the climate warms. 325. Current Knowledge Gaps According to the USGCRP, there is currently limited knowledge about the ability of communities and regions to adapt to a changing climate. To address this shortfall, research on climate change impacts and adaptation must begin to include complex human dimensions such as economics, management, governance, behavior, and equity. As part of this effort, interdisciplinary research on adapting to climate change in the built environment must take into account the interconnectedness of natural and human systems. Climate change research has typically focused on how changes in temperature and precipitation will affect national and regional systems. Only a handful of studies have examined the effects of climate change at the neighborhood or building scale, and most of these studies are assessments of how upstream changes in natural systems (e.g., snow pack, precipitation rates, stream flow) may eventually impact human settlements (Chang 2003; Vogel, Bell, and Fennessey 1997; Wilby 2008). More research is needed to understand the direct impacts of temperature and precipitation change on neighborhoods and buildings. To understand the impacts of climate change on neighborhoods and buildings, additional downscaling of climate models will be necessary. While the downscaling of climate models is becoming a common practice in the atmospheric sciences, only a handful of studies have attempted to translate data from these models into formats useful for planning and building professionals. One immediate need is \"future\" TMY files for building energy modeling, but other examples include data on precipitation to determine the size of stormwater systems. The downscaling of climate models introduces a high level of uncertainty; these new data will have significant limitations. Working together, atmospheric scientists and building professionals can help to convey this uncertainty and explain the risk of action or inaction to building owners and the public. This may help to open a broader dialogue on how to prioritize resources to respond to climate change, and build support for local mitigation and adaptation efforts. An interdisciplinary approach will also be important for reframing climate change mitigation and adaptation as complementary rather than conflicting goals. While Appendix C of this report outlines a number of adaptation strategies that building professionals can implement to make their projects more resilient, more research is necessary to understand the benefits, costs, and efficacy of each strategy. This could be accomplished by 33linking data from downscaled climate models with building energy or environmental performance models, but it will also require evaluation of long-term maintenance costs and the effective useful life of each strategy. In addition, little is known about how the interactive effect of multiple strategies might increase or decrease resilience and/or the capacity to adapt. In the last decade, regional analysis of climate change in the United States has focused on the Northeast and California. This has created a wealth of data that has helped cities such as Boston and San Francisco to initiate climate adaptation efforts. Because climate change will affect all of North America, additional research should be encouraged in other regions as well. Special attention should be paid to places where the population may have a limited capacity to adapt. Coordinated efforts to capture lessons learned from the Northeast and California may also allow for rapid advances in local knowledge, and allow for best practices in resilience and adaptation to flourish across the United States. Finally, there is limited research on how climate impacts will affect plant selection for landscape design and shifting pest zones. Building professionals should encourage researchers in these areas to evaluate the possible effects on the built environment. If these potential impacts are ignored, climate change could negatively affect what is otherwise a resilient design. For example, plants are an important component of landscape design for stormwater management. Plants that previously thrived in an area may be vulnerable to new pests that migrated to there because of changes in temperature or precipitation. The most resilient buildings will adapt not only to water and temperature impacts, but also to storm, pest, landscape, and fire impacts. As climate adaptation is incorporated into building design, case studies and lessons learned will help answer these questions and fill gaps in knowledge. 346.

Environmental Building News:1-9. 40APPENDIX A: Defining Key Terms Just as the term green building has different meanings to different people, terms related to climate adaptation and climate mitigation have varying meanings in the literature. The variation is often driven by a difference in scale and time frame. The definitions below highlight the variations in meanings in order to clarify how green building and climate adaptation intersect at the local level. Green Building Green building is the effort to change the way the built environment is designed, constructed, and operated. Green building takes an integrated, interdisciplinary approach from the early planning stages to the operation of individual buildings, neighborhoods, and entire communities (U.S. Green Building Council 2010). This holistic approach considers the entire supply chain from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and deconstruction. Green building is concerned with air quality, energy and water use, human health, waste reduction, pollution, and environmental degradation (U.S. EPA 2011). Therefore, green building is poised to incorporate climate adaptation strategies in order to lessen the negative effects of future climate impacts. Climate and Climate Change The novelist Robert Heinlein once wrote, “Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get.” Climate includes longer-term weather patterns, and variations in elements such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity. Climate change is evaluated by the statistically significant change in the mean state or variability of climate measurements that persists for decades or longer (IPCC 2001). Past climate data is used in the planning and design of the built environment. Climate change will require building professionals to consider both past climate data and projected regional climate impacts. Uncertainty Planning for climate adaptation and increasing the adaptive capacity of a system inevitably involves some uncertainty. Both the IPCC and the U.S. Global Change Research Program are transparent about the level of uncertainty in their assessments and projections (IPCC 2007; A-1Nakicenovic et al. 2000). The level of uncertainty is presented as a range of likelihoods ranging from very unlikely to very likely (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). The IPCC probabilities are based on quantitative analysis or expert views (IPCC 2007). Similarly, the U.S. National Assessment classifications are based on the collective judgment of the National Assessment Team (USGCRP 2009). Building professionals must accept some uncertainty about climate change as they make design and planning decisions that will be resilient to future conditions. Scenarios One of the best ways to understand uncertainty and make decisions when effects are unknown is through the use of projected future scenarios (USGCRP 2001). The IPCC presents different scenarios of emissions projections considering a range of possible changes in population, economic growth, technological development, and improvements in energy efficiency. The use of scenarios acknowledges that there is uncertainty in the factors that contribute to climate change. Scenarios are an important component of an assessment because they paint a picture of possible alternative futures, incorporating current knowledge and uncertainties (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). Scenarios are an effort to inform decision makers as they attempt to balance risks and costs. Mitigation Mitigation strategies for climate change are different from strategies to “mitigate” or lessen the effects of climate change. In this document, \"mitigation\" means actions that aim to reduce greenhouse gases, for example by increasing the percentage of renewable energy or increasing energy efficiency. In the United States, buildings contribute 39 percent of national CO 2 emissions. Green building is an important strategy to reduce CO emissions by reducing the 2 energy demand of buildings and increasing the efficiency of energy use (U.S. Green Building Council 2010). Mitigation efforts are important because they will reduce the magnitude of climate change, but they should be coupled with adaptation strategies to lessen the impacts of extreme weather events. Mitigation and adaptation can act in synergy so that their combined effect is greater than the effects of efforts were implemented separately (Adger et al. 2007). A-2Adaptation Adaptation is the adjustment of our built environment, infrastructure, and social systems in response to actual or expected climatic events or their effects. Adaptation includes responses to reduce harm or capture benefits (IPCC 2007). The IPCC outlines three different types of adaptation: • Autonomous adaptation is a normal response to relatively stable, average climate and the natural variable climatic conditions that were common in the recent past (Moser 2009). Future climatic conditions will likely have more extreme variation and autonomous adaptation may not be able to respond within the time frame that change is occurring. This type of adaptation is also referred to as \"normal adaptation\" (Moser 2009) or \"spontaneous adaptation\" (IPCC 2007). • Anticipatory adaptation or proactive adaptation includes actions taken before climate change impacts are observed (IPCC 2007). Anticipatory adaptation is best understood at the local scale as a planned response to a discrete climate event (Brooks, Adger, and Kelly 2005). • Planned adaptation is the result of policy decisions that are motivated by an awareness that conditions have changed or are about to change (IPCC 2007). It includes additional efforts to examine, plan, and implement strategies for climate adaptation (Moser 2009). Present and projected climate change information is used to review how currently planned practices, policies, and infrastructure will respond to the expected change. Effective planned adaptation requires an awareness of the climate impacts, availability of effective adaptation measures, information about these measures, and availability of resources and incentives for implementation. Planned adaptation strategies can be evaluated not only by their potential to reduce current and future climate risks but also by how they support other policy objectives for sustainability (Fussel 2007). Vulnerability Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to and unable to cope with the negative effects of climate change. Vulnerability of a building or other parts of the built environment is the result of age, condition or integrity, proximity to other infrastructure, and A-3level of service (specifically for a roadway) (CCSP 2008). The impacts of a climate event on a system or piece of infrastructure are mediated by its vulnerability. Risk Risk is commonly defined as the magnitude of an impact and the probability of its occurrence (Blanco et al. 2009). For example, the risk posed to a structure by sea level rise depends on the rate of sea level rise, the structure’s existing vulnerability, and the rate at which the structure can adapt from a behavioral and mechanical perspective. The ability to reduce the risk to a system will depend on the timescale for both implementing adaptation measures and the evolution or occurrence of the hazard (Brooks 2003). Risk is inherently connected to vulnerability, and both terms are complicated by the lack of a common metric for assessment (Blanco et al. 2009). Adaptive Capacity Adaptive capacity takes adaptation one step further by considering the opportunities and barriers to adaptation. Adaptive capacity is a measure of a system’s ability to adjust its characteristics or behavior in order to respond to existing and future climate variability. Increasing adaptive capacity may require investment in a system and/or the creation of strategies to respond to future climate conditions (Brooks, Adger, and Kelly 2005). A system’s adaptive capacity may be restricted by outside factors such as financial constraints and political challenges. Resilience Resilience is the measure of a system to buffer negative climate effects while maintaining its structure and function (IPCC 2007). A resilient system is the converse of a vulnerable system. A resilient system is not sensitive to climate variability and change and has the capacity to adapt (Blanco et al. 2009). In the context of future climate change, a resilient system would be able to operate at its normal capacity given more extreme climate effects such as higher or lower temperatures, greater wind speeds, and increased or decreased precipitation levels. General Circulation Models General circulation models (GCMs) are the most comprehensive models of the Earth’s climate system. These models include the global atmosphere, the oceans, the land surface, and sea ice and snow cover. GCMs are tested by their ability to model existing and historical climate conditions, a process sometimes referred to as \"backcasting\" (USGCRP 2001). Uncertainties of A-4GCMs include the inability to model physical processes at the appropriate scale, and the difficulty of simulating various feedback mechanisms, for example water vapor and warming, and clouds and radiation (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). The IPCC and the US National Assessment Program use GCMs to provide geographically and physically consistent estimates of regional climate change and the associated potential effects (Nakicenovic et al. 2000; USGCRP 2001). These regional climate change projections can be used to select appropriate climate adaptation strategies.

In order to design resilient and adaptable green buildings and neighborhoods, it is essential that green building professionals understand how climate change is likely to impact a region, and how these changes will manifest in the built environment. The tables that follow summarize regional climate change impacts drawn from the literature. The information also suggests potential effects on the built environment and ways to measure these effects. The climate impacts presented here are taken primarily from the United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP; formerly known as the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP)). Mandated by Congress in 1990, its mission is “to build a knowledge base that informs human responses to climate and global change through coordinated and integrated federal programs of research, education, communication, and decision support” (USGCRP 2010). The USGCRP includes 13 U.S. departments and agencies, ranging from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), to the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DOD). The USGCRP’s 2009 report, Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States, is the most comprehensive source for information on regional climate change impacts in the United States. It compiles the results of the CCSP’s 21 previous Synthesis and Assessment Products (SAPs), each focused on a key climate change issue. Another important input to the USGCRP report is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. The IPCC is the world’s leading organization for the compilation, review and dissemination of the current “state of the knowledge on climate change” (IPCC 2010). The USGCRP report draws upon many additional external peer-reviewed sources such as the Transportation Research Board, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and regional climate change impact studies. In a collaborative effort led by NOAA, the report was written and reviewed by a group of highly respected scientists in federal agencies, private consulting firms, research universities and Department of Energy national laboratories. Figure B1 shows the flow of research and information that inform the USGCRP report, the source for many of the climate change impacts reported here. B-1Figure B-1: Sources of Data for Climate Change Impacts Presented in Appendix B Structure of the Climate Impacts Tables The following tables list predicted climate impacts by region. Impacts are presented by category (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and in four time frames: observed by 2010, near-term (2010-2040), mid-term (2040-2070), and long-term (2070-2100). These tables provide predictions about future climate; however, these impacts are by no means certain. Future climate depends on an extremely complex set of variables, some of which are linked to human behavior. Therefore, future climate characteristics are uncertain and often studied using two or more emissions scenarios reflecting different possible futures. Some impacts are reported as a range of values, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in predicting future climate. These tables are designed as reference tools to provide green building professionals with a “first look” at the challenges regions will face under climate change. However, regional impacts may not provide the level of resolution needed to respond to all the risks that climate change poses at the local level. It may be necessary for green building professionals to seek out additional local sources of climate change data and impacts to supplement these data. B-2Northeast Region Climate Change Impacts The Northeast can expect continued warming and associated climate change effects. Correlated impacts of warming will likely include the following (USGCRP 2009): • Increasing frequency and intensity of extreme heat events • Shorter winters with fewer cold days and more precipitation • Short-term droughts as frequently as once each summer • Sea level rise that exceeds the global average • Increased flooding from more frequent and intense rain events • Reduced snow cover, affecting stream flows The associated impacts of climate change on the Northeast region will likely have substantial economic, social, and environmental ramifications. In addition, the Northeast region contains several major urban areas located in coastal or watershed areas. New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia are the 1st-, 5th-, and 8th- largest Combined Statistical Areas, respectively, in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2009). Thus, the climate impacts of sea-level rise and more intense precipitation will have a substantial impact on the urban centers of the Northeast.

The warming of the climate will have mixed impacts on both the natural systems and the human populations of the Midwest. The two primary climatic changes will be an increase in the temperature throughout the year, and increasing variability in precipitation patterns.

Projected increases in temperature are expected to have the greatest impacts in the summer, while precipitation changes are expected to have the greatest impacts during winter and spring. Precipitation is expected to increase in the north and decrease in the south. According to the 2009 USGCRP Report, the primary impacts of the climatic changes will be: • Increased drought frequency due to increased temperature and evaporation rates leading to increased water scarcity • Declining air quality due to increased pollen and ozone levels • Shifting habitat zones affecting the distribution of native plant and animal species and increasing risk of insect infestation B-15B-16Near-Term Mid-Term Long-Term Climate Change Impacts Relative To† Observed by 2010 Projections (2010- Projections (2040- Projections (2070- Effects on the Built Environment 2040) 2070) 2100)  Increase of 1.3  Increase of 1.1 to  Increase of 1.6 to  Increase of 2.5 to  Increased summertime HVAC energy usage (kWh), Average annual air temperature 1961-1979 degrees F 3.8 degrees F‡ 6.9 degrees F‡ 13.2 degrees F‡  Decreased wintertime HVAC energy usage (kWh)  Increase of 0.8 to  Increase of 1.7 to  Increase of 2.4 to Average Summer air temperature 1961-1979 n/a  Increased summertime HVAC energy demand (kW) 4.6 degrees F‡ 8.7 degrees F‡ 16.6 degrees F‡  Increased HVAC tonnage needed to achieve comfort levels (total Frequency of extremely hot days installed tonnage);  Increase up to (high temperatures at or above 1961-1979 n/a    Increased symptom complaints during Summer months (Summer 100% 90 degrees F) complaints);  Increased frequency of brownouts and blackouts (yearly outages).  Increased summertime night-hours HVAC energy usage (kWh);  50% to 100% Frequency of extreme heat 5% yearly chance (20-  Increased summertime symptom complaints (Summer yearly chance (1 or 2 waves (yearly likelihood of event year event n/a   complaints);  Increased frequency of brownouts and blackouts year event occurring) recurrence) (yearly service outages);  Decreased summertime usage of recurrence) outdoor areas (average weekly users).  Increase of 0.6 to  Increase of 1.2 to  Increase of 2.2 to  Decreased wintertime HVAC energy demand (kW), Average Winter air temperature 1961-1979 n/a 4.2 degrees F‡ 6.9 degrees F‡ 12.5 degrees F‡  Increased risk of freeze/thaw damage (freezing rainfall events).  9% decrease in  Increased # of days with irrigation restrictions (days per year);  Availability of water resources 1950    Increased # of days with service interruption (days per year);  aquifer storage Decreased available water pressure (low-pressure days).  -2% to -3%  -3% to -5%  -3% to -9% (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction)  Increased dependence on irrigation to maintain landscaping Change in summer precipitation 1961-1979 n/a (gallons of water used per season) -15% to +11% -30% to +19% (very -49% to +31% (very likely range) likely range) (very likely range)  +3%  +4% to +5%  +5% to +8% (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction) Change in winter precipitation 1961-1979 n/a  Increased risk of water damage (yearly maintenance costs). -5% to +10% -6% to +14% -9% to +25% (very likely range) (very likely range) (very likely range) n/a,  13% increase  Increased flooding of low-lying areas (yearly days flooded).   8% intensity in number of days with  7% intensity  12% - 13% intensity Increased overload and backup of stormwater drainage systems Intensity/duration of precipitation 1961-1979 (1958) very heavy and combined sewer systems (# of days flooded; gal of overflow  8% to 13% precipitation since  9% to 12% duration  18% - 22% duration per year). duration 1958  Higher flood insurance rates (yearly premium).  Increased need to filter indoor air to maintain IEQ (# of Pollen levels n/a n/a    symptom complaints per season)  50% to 300% increase in days exceeding EPA 8hr  Increased need to filter indoor air to maintain IEQ (# of ozone standard Ground-level ozone 2007 n/a   symptom complaints per season),  Decreased ability to use  0% to 25% outdoor air ventilation (# of action days per year) increase in average ground-level ozone concentration STSEP Greater numbers, earlier  Increased need for pest control services (# of pest complaints emergence, and northward n/a n/a    per season);  Increased damage to landscaping and green roofs migration of insects (% of greenery damaged; yearly plant replacement costs) ‡ Temperature ranges based on IPCC \"very likely\" range ERUTAREPMET NOITATIPICERP/RETAW Predicted Climate Change Impacts: Great Plains Region Primary Sources: United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), 2009; Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 2009 †Historical base periods used to establish reference points that predate significant climate change impacts YTILAUQ RIASouthwest Region Climate Change Impacts The Southwest region covers the land area from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast.

The general global warming trend is projected to have a significant impact on the regional climate of the Southwest. The region is likely to experience a significant increase in summer temperatures and in the variability of water cycles. Climate change is expected to have the following impacts: • Scarcity of water supplies due to reduced snowpack, longer periods of low precipitation, shorter winters, longer summers, and increased evaporation • Higher frequency and altered timing of flooding (shifting more to winter and early spring) • Transformation of the landscape due to increasing temperature, drought, wildfires, and invasive species • Increased water conflicts between agricultural and urban needs B-19B-20Near-Term Mid-Term Long-Term Climate Change Impacts Relative To† Observed by 2010 Projections (2010- Projections (2040- Projections (2070- Effects on the Built Environment 2040)‡ 2070)‡ 2100)‡  Increase of 1.6  Increase of 1.0 to  Increase of 1.6 to Increase of 2.5 to 11.8  Increased summer7me HVAC energy usage (kWh),  Decreased Average annual air temperature 1961-1979 degrees F 3.7 degrees F‡ 6.4 degrees F‡ degrees F‡ winter7me HVAC energy usage (kWh) Average Summer air temperature 1961-1979  In dc er ge ra es ee s o Ff 1.6  I 4n .c 2r e da es ge re o ef s 1 F.1 ‡ to  I 7n .c 7r e da es ge re o ef s 2 F.1 ‡ to  1In 3c .5re da es ge r o ef e s2 .

The increase in average temperature is projected to result in increased frequency and intensity of precipitation, longer summers, shorter winters, and sea-level rise. The effects of the anticipated climate changes include the following (USGCRP 2009): • Longer, warmer summers resulting in drier conditions (despite increased precipitation) • Increased intensity and frequency of coastal storms • Land subsidence/settling due to thawing permafrost damaging runways, water and sewer systems, and other infrastructure • Increased coastal erosion • More frequent wildfires • Increased outbreaks of insects B-27B-28Near-Term Mid-Term Long-Term Climate Change Impacts Relative To† Observed by 2010 Projections (2010- Projections (2040- Projections (2070- Effects on the Built Environment 2040) 2070) 2100)  Increase of 3.4  Increase of 0.4 to  Increase of 2.9 to  Increase of 2.4 to  Increased summertime HVAC energy usage (kWh); Average annual air temperature 1961-1979 degrees F 4.7 degrees F‡ 5.7 degrees F‡ 13.5 degrees F‡  Decreased wintertime HVAC energy usage (kWh) -0.1 to 2.8 degrees Average Summer air temperature 1961-1979 n/a -0.8 to 5 degrees F‡ -1 to13.9 degrees F‡  Increased summertime HVAC energy demand (kW) F‡  Increased thawing;  10% to 20% higher  Increased land subsidence (area/year),  Increased damage to Thawing permafrost 1970s    infrastructure infrastructure from sinking land ($ economic loss per year) maintenance costs Reduced access and mobility due  Decreased mobility and accessibility (# of days inaccessible; n/a     to loss of ice average travel time)  Increased summertime night-hours HVAC energy usage (kWh); Frequency of extreme heat 5% yearly chance (20- 10% yearly chance  Increased summertime symptom complaints (Summer events (yearly likelihood of event year event n/a   (10-year event complaints);  Increased frequency of brownouts and blackouts occurring) recurrence) recurrence) (yearly service outages);  Decreased wintertime HVAC energy demand (kW),  Increased  Increase of 4 to 9  Increase of 5 to 20 Average Winter air temperature 1961-1979 n/a -1 to +8 degrees F‡ winter rainfall (inches as rain),  Increased risk of freeze/thaw degrees F‡ degrees F‡ damage (seasonal maintenance costs)  Approximately 10 Water resource stores 1970 day reduction in snow  Decreased natural  Decreased natural  Decreased natural  Increased dependence on reservoir storage (ft3 storage season snowpack storage snowpack storage snowpack storage capacity);  Increased well depth necessary to reach aquifer (feet)  +6%  +11% to +13% +17% to +23% (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction) Change in summer precipitation 1961-1979 n/a  Increased risk of water damage (yearly maintenance costs). -1% to +13% +3% to +20% +11% to +36% (very likely range) (very likely range) (very likely range)  +6% to +9%  +15% to +17%  23% to 37% (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction) Change in winter precipitation 1961-1979 n/a  Increased risk of water damage (yearly maintenance costs). -5% to +23% +4% to +25% 13% to 59% (very likely range) (very likely range) (very likely range)  Increase 23% precipitation intensity;  Increased seasonal flooding of low-lying areas (yearly days Intensity of precipitation 1958  Increase 13% days    flooded). with heavy precipitation  Increased building and infrastructural damage and maintenance Storm frequency and intensity 1950-1980     (cost of repair / reconstruction);  Increased risk of flooding from storm surges (frequency of inundation)  Decrease overall  Decrease overall  Decrease overall  Increased danger of inundation during storms (flood events/yr),  Overall decrease in Sea ice extent 1980 with year-to-year with year-to-year with year-to-year  Increased erosion in coastal areas (area lost / yr), Increased September extent variability variability variability vulnerability to storm damage ($ cost of repair)  Increased loss of coastal land (sq. miles / year),  Increased risk  100% increase in Coastal erosion 1960    of damage from inundation to coastal development (frequency of rate of erosion inundation) STSEP  Increased need for pesticides for landscaping (frequency of Spruce Beetle treatment),  Increased likelihood of wildfires due to wood-boring Insect outbreaks 1990    Infestation insects (events/year or area burned/year);  Increase risk of damage to buildings from insects.

The U.S.- affiliated Pacific and Caribbean Islands are faced with unique and difficult climate change-related challenges. With populations located primarily along coastal regions, island communities are intensely vulnerable. Projections of climate change in the Pacific and Caribbean Island regions anticipate increased temperatures, sea-level rise, decreased year- round precipitation (despite more frequent heavy rain events and increased rainfall during summer months), and a likely increase in hurricane wind speeds and rainfall. These climate changes will have the following effects (USGCRP 2009): • Reduced access to freshwater • Increasing vulnerability of communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems due to sea-level rise and coastal storms • Changing coastal and marine ecosystems B-31B-32Predicted Climate Change Impacts: Islands Near-Term Mid-Term Long-Term Climate Change Impacts Relative To† Observed by 2010 Projections (2010- Projections (2040- Projections (2070- Effects on the Built Environment 2040) 2070) 2100)  Increase of 0 to 3  Increase of 1 to 5  Increase of 2 to 9  Increase of 3.4 degrees F in Hawaii; 1 degrees F in Hawaii; 1 degrees F in Hawaii; 2 Average annual air temperature 1961-1979  Increased annual HVAC energy usage (kWh) degrees F to 3 degrees F in to 4 degrees F in to 8 degrees F in Caribbean.‡ Caribbean.‡ Caribbean.‡  Increase of 0 to 3  Increase of 1 to 5  Increase of 2 to 9 degrees F in Hawaii; 1 degrees F in Hawaii; 2 degrees F in Hawaii; 2 Average Summer air temperature 1961-1979 n/a  Increased summertime HVAC energy demand (kW) to 3 degrees F in to 4 degrees F in to 8 degrees F in Caribbean.‡ Caribbean.‡ Caribbean.‡  Increase of 1.1 - 4.6  Increase of 0 to 3  Increase of 2 to 9 degrees F in Hawaii;  degrees F in Hawaii; 1 degrees F in Hawaii; 2 Average Winter air temperature 1961-1979 n/a Increase 1.3 - 3.9  Increased wintertime HVAC energy demand (kW) to 5 degrees F in to 8 degrees F in degrees F in Caribbean.‡ Caribbean.‡ Caribbean.‡  Increased dependence on rainwater storage; Availability of fresh water  Increased dependence on desalination techniques (gal/day (Caribbean Islands only; desalination),  Decreased ability to use water resources for 1900-2000 n/a    predictions for Pacific islands are irrigation (days/year without service); highly uncertain)  Increased incidence of water shortage (days with usage restrictions per year) Change in summer precipitation  -7% to -10%  -12% to -18%  -14% to -36% (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction) (Caribbean Islands only;  Increased dependence on irrigation to maintain landscaping 1961-1979 n/a predictions for Pacific islands are (gallons of water used per season) -23% to +8% -44% to +11% -68% to +14% highly uncertain) (very likely range) (very likely range) (very likely range)  -1% to -3%  -3% to -5%  -3% to 0% Change in winter precipitation (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction) (ave. prediction) (Caribbean Islands only;  Increased dependence on irrigation to maintain landscaping 1961-1979 n/a predictions for Pacific islands are (gallons of water used per season) -15% to +11% -14% to +5% -35% to +19% highly uncertain) (very likely range) (very likely range) (very likely range)  Increased potential for building and infrastructural damage and maintenance (cost of repair / reconstruction);  Increased risk of Storm frequency and intensity n/a n/a    flooding from storm surges (frequency of inundation);  Higher storm insurance rates (annual insurance premium)  Increased  Increased danger of inundation during storms (flood events/yr); frequency of extreme  Increased vulnerability to storm damage (annual cost of repairs), Sea level rise 1961-1979 sea level event from    <5% annual  Increased saltwater contamination of freshwater reserves (average saline concentration) probability to 20%  Increased loss of coastal land (sq. miles / year),  Increased risk of damage from inundation to coastal Coastal erosion n/a n/a    development (frequency of inundation),  Increased costs and frequency of infrastructure maintenance (annual maintenance costs) Primary Sources: United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), 2009; Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 2009. †Historical base periods used to establish reference points that predate significant climate change impacts ‡ Temperature ranges based on IPCC \"very likely\" range ERUTAREPMET NOITATIPICERP/RETAW LATSAOCReferences IPCC.

B-35APPENDIX C: Adaptation Strategies This appendix provides a set of basic strategies to help a design, construction, and/or operations and maintenance team to incorporate adaptation principles into its project. Less detailed in scope than the Best Management Practices (BMPs) issued by many Federal and State agencies, each of the 81 strategies is provided to encourage a broad discussion of how specific climate impacts should be addressed by a project team. Because of the limited scope and lack of explicit detail for each strategy, teams should to do additional research to implement each strategy into their project. It is best to incorporate these strategies at the beginning of a project, in pre- or schematic design. As a project progresses, teams can utilize the additional information listed at the end of each strategy to follow through on the design, detailing, and construction. Strategy Format Each of the strategies includes the following information: 1. Objective: The purpose of each strategy. 2. Description: A two- to three- sentence description of the strategy and how it responds to climate impacts. 3. Regional Priority: A map of the United States divided into the regions used by the USGCRP in its most recent climate change assessment. Each strategy is designated as a \"high\" or \"low\" priority for that region. If the strategy is not applicable, it is listed as \"N/A\". 4. Primary/Secondary Impact: The primary and secondary impact categories the strategy address such factors as temperature, water/precipitation, pests, fire, storms, etc. For more detailed information on each climate impact category, refer to Appendix B. 5. Measured Effect of Strategy: How each strategy responds to a changing climate, such as a reduction of interior air temperature, reduction in peak electrical demand (kW), etc. 6. Level: Whether the strategy is a \"no regrets\" strategy or a \"resilience\" strategy. A no-regrets strategy is defined as a climate adaptation strategy that will generate social and/or economic benefits whether or not climate change occurs. A C-1resilience strategy is a climate adaptation strategy that allows a system to absorb disturbances while maintaining its structure and function. 7. Duration: The expected effective useful life of the strategy, measured in years. 8. Control: Who has control over the operation of the strategy, such as the Owner, Occupant, or Operations and Maintenance staff (O&M). A strategy may also be passively controlled. Passive control are strategies that require no intervention or activation once they are implemented, such as building orientation. 9. Associated LEED Credits: Which credits in the LEED-ND, LEED-NC, LEED-H, and LEED-EB rating systems are associated with each strategy. 10. Related Strategies: Which of the other strategies in Appendix C are related to this strategy. Up to three strategies are listed, though many more may be applicable. 11. Additional Information: Additional Internet or common design resources to assist with the development of each strategy.

Description: Well-designed interior sun control and shading devices allow occupants to reduce solar heat gain while improving daylighting quality. This can reduce interior air temperature, peak electrical demand, and annual cooling requirements. By controlling daylighting and glare, occupants can also rely less on electric lighting, further reducing cooling requirements and electrical demand. Typical interior shading device systems installed in a building include Venetian blinds, adjustable louvers, or shade cloth. Fixed systems, such as light shelves, can help to redistribute daylight throughout a space without requiring occupant adjustments.

Description: Well-specified glazing reflects unwanted solar heat gain and permits adequate visible light for daylighting. This can help to prevent interior overheating, thereby reducing peak electrical demand and annual cooling requirements. Typical glazing systems consist of a frame material, a spacer material, panes of glass, inert gas between panes, and a selective coating on one or more surfaces of the glass.

Retrocommissioning C-158Process and Operations Flexible Dress Codes/Scheduling Objective: To give occupants the opportunity to adapt to increased temperatures either by modifying their clothing or avoiding the warmest part of a day. Description: Flexible dress codes and schedules allow building occupants to adapt to warmer temperatures by either dressing lighter or avoiding working during the hottest part of the day. While both strategies seem to be commonsense, many companies have strict dress codes that require heavier amounts of clothing to be worn, even in summer. Other companies may have a culture that requires additional clothing, such as long shirts and ties. Developing a building- or project- wide policy will allow staff to adapt to changing climatic conditions and potentially reduce energy use and demand in a building.

Description: Retrocommissioning, or the recommissioning of building equipment, is a common practice to ensure that building equipment is operating as designed. Retrocommissioning as an adaptation measure is a process by which data is gathered on outdoor weather conditions and compared to the operations of equipment. If it is expected that temperature will increase over time, equipment can be tuned to perform better as temperatures increase, or replaced if no longer operating efficiently.

        "Preface The majority of efforts to address climate change through green building are focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is reflected in the current U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, which allocates over 25 percent of available points for reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with building systems, transportation, water, waste, and construction materials (U.S. Green Building Council, 2008). By definition, greenhouse gas emission reductions are climate change mitigation. Green buildings should include both mitigation and adaptation strategies if we hope to shape the built environment in a way that is both responsive and resilient to future climate extremes. While LEED does not require climate change adaptation strategies to achieve certification, this report summarizes current technical and scientific data on the impacts of climate change on the built environment in an effort to support the work of building professionals in this emerging area of concern and to inform the selection of strategies and approaches. Within this document, we identify climate-related vulnerabilities at the regional level and prioritize design, construction, and operation strategies that will increase resilience and facilitate climate adaptation. The mission of the USGBC is to enable an environmentally and socially responsible, healthy, and prosperous environment that improves quality of life. Following the formation of the USGBC in 1993, the organization's members quickly realized that the sustainable building industry needed a transparent system to define and measure \"green buildings.\" The LEED rating system provides a third-party certification of buildings and neighborhoods designed to improve performance in energy savings, water efficiency, CO emissions reduction, improved indoor 2 environmental quality, stewardship of resources and sensitivity to environmental impacts. The LEED rating system has been modified over time in order to continue the advancement of green building performance. The most recent version, LEED Version 3.0, was launched in 2009 and provided a significant update to the LEED program. This report on climate adaptation strategies and other documents such as the Core Concepts Guide continue to advance green building practice and provide USGBC members with timely and accurate information. 5",
        "1. Executive Summary The USGBC has been active in addressing climate change since the early days of LEED. These efforts have focused on guiding green building professionals toward reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of a project, thus mitigating the contribution of the project to global climate change. However, world climate change experts such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have indicated that the world will almost certainly experience some degree of climate change no matter how quickly greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. This makes climate adaptation necessary. Because climate change is related to human behaviors, uncertainty remains around the degree of change and types of impact. The points of uncertainty are described in Appendix A: Key Terms. As green building professionals, we need to understand the probable impacts of climate change on the built environment and to incorporate appropriate adaptation strategies into our practices so that the environments we design, build, and manage today will be suitable for a range of uncertain futures. While climate has always been integrated into the building professions, our codes, standards, and practices typically assume that the future will be similar to the past. Climate change requires that we update these codes, standards, and practices with the best available knowledge. Planning to adapt to the effects of climate change in the built environment involves first understanding how the regional climate is likely to change. Projections of change, by U.S. region, are included in Appendix B: Regional Climate Change Impacts. By understanding the probable impacts, design teams can set modified performance goals, diving deeper into project-specific changes at the building or neighborhood level, and then select strategies to increase the resilience and adaptive capacity of each project. The body of this report summarizes the most recent research on the likely impacts of climate change at various scales: regional, neighborhood, and site or building. We report predicted climate changes by region, and wherever possible we present a range of predicted future characteristics in the categories of temperature, precipitation, coastlines, air quality, pests, and fires. We also explore how climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts at all scales interact synergistically, with a focus on how green building professionals can approach adaptation in the built environment. 6",
        "Appendix C contains a set of specific strategies that can be used to enhance resilience and provide adaptive benefits. The strategies are divided into six categories: 1) envelope, 2) siting and landscape, 3) heating, cooling, and lighting, 4) water and waste, 5) equipment, and 6) process and operation. Several of the strategies presented are “no-regrets” strategies. A no- regrets strategy will generate social and/or economic benefits whether or not climate change occurs. A \"resilient\" strategy will allow a system to absorb disturbances such as increased precipitation or flooding while maintaining its structure and function. To our knowledge, this report represents one of the first attempts to compile all research on the impacts of climate change on the built environment, and to link impacts with strategies for addressing them. The information and strategies presented here provide a solid baseline from which green building professionals can begin to address climate change adaptation in their projects. However, there is a great need for further research. Not all U.S. regions have received significant attention from climate change researchers. To date, the research has focused disproportionately on the heavily populated coastal areas. Of even greater concern is the significant lack of work focused on connecting climate research with practice. While this report represents a first step towards bridging this gap, building professionals will need significant future guidance to address the sizable climate change challenge. This report concludes with an analysis of current research needs and suggests resources to develop to bridge the research- practice divide. 7",
        "2. Introduction A changing climate presents a challenge to the planners and designers of the built environment. Building professionals will need to incorporate strategies that consider future climate change within their region. This contrasts with the current practice of basing building and neighborhood design decisions on historic climate data. While ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) encourages cities to plan for the effects of climate change by creating a comprehensive climate adaptation plan, building professionals need their own framework and tools for incorporating climate adaptation strategies in their projects. This section of the report describes climate adaptation planning, the primary ways that climate currently influences building and neighborhood design at a variety of scales, and the steps for incorporating climate adaptation strategies into a project. The Challenge of a Changing Climate The IPCC and the EPA report that some degree of climate change will occur regardless of whether we begin to significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The effect of climate change on neighborhoods and buildings will depend on the sensitivity and adaptability of these systems (US EPA 2011). Adaptation is defined as the adjustment of our built environment, infrastructure, and social systems in response to actual or expected climatic events or their effects. Adaptation includes responses to reduce harm or to capture benefits (IPCC 2007) as well as resilience, the ability of a system to absorb a climatic event without failing or changing state. Until now, green building practice has focused primarily on lessening the built environment’s contribution to climate change through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This is still a critical role for green building, as residential and commercial buildings contribute approximately 37% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States (U.S. Energy Information Administration 2009). The next step is to understand the impact of climate change on the built environment and to incorporate appropriate adaptation strategies into green building practice so that the environments we design, build, and manage today will be suitable for a range of uncertain futures. 8",
        "Emissions trends help us to understand why the climate is changing, but it is difficult to predict the long-term climate impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. Making exact predictions of how global average temperatures will change over time is complicated by factors such as population growth, economic growth, technological development, and energy efficiency improvements (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). These four factors result from human behaviors and policies and complicate any series of calculations. For green building professionals, an integral part of adapting to climate change is the continued effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the built environment while increasing adaptation strategies. Mitigation and adaptation strategies should not be seen as an \"either/or\" proposition. For example, renewable energy strategies will both reduce a building’s dependency on the electrical grid and reduce carbon emissions and potentially make the building more resilient to power outages. Therefore, green building strategies can often reduce greenhouse gas emissions while building resilience to the effects of climate change by enabling future adaptation. The Role of Climate in Building and Neighborhood Design Climate data is used to inform a number of different decisions in the design, construction, and operation of the built environment. These decisions include the selection of systems for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), tree and plant species for landscaping, and appropriate building materials. Currently, climate-related decisions are based on historic climate data and past trends, with the inherent assumption that the climate will remain relatively stable in the future. Table 1 summarizes some of the ways climate data informs design decisions. Today’s building professionals should consider climate projections in conjunction with historic trends and current conditions as they make design, construction, operations and maintenance decisions. 9",

Climate change will also shift plant hardiness zones northward, affecting plant selection. This report provides information and resources for addressing climate change impacts in the built environment. Appendix B summarizes projected regional climate impacts and illustrates anticipated effects of climate change in nine geographical regions of the United States. Once climate change impacts are understood, a project team can evaluate the range of possible adaptation strategies to increase its system’s resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change. The following sections of this report outline the steps for different scales and stages of planning and design. 10",

Monitor and reevaluate resiliency While different in scale from climate adaptation planning at the project level, a city-level plan is an important resource for understanding local impacts and identifying city-wide priorities for increased resiliency. For example, if a city’s combined sewer and stormwater system is already overloaded and climate change impacts include increased precipitation, onsite stormwater management should be considered to increase a project's resiliency to storm events. 11",
        "Incorporating Climate Adaptation into New Buildings and Neighborhoods Green building professionals can integrate climate adaptation strategies into a project by using the following four-step process. The existing LEED Rating System and the LEED Reference Guides complement this process by identifying greenhouse gas mitigation strategies. Professionals aware of the predicted climate change impacts for their project’s region can set performance goals for the future climate. For example, a project in a region expected to experience more intense rain events might set a goal of managing all stormwater runoff onsite. The team would then analyze predicted changes in precipitation for the region under multiple scenarios and select strategies that would achieve the goal throughout the design life and under multiple precipitation scenarios. 1. Understand regional impacts: Identify climate impacts for the project’s region. 2. Modify performance goals: Incorporate possible impacts into performance goals for the building or neighborhood. 3. Determine the range of effects on the local built environment: Refine regional impacts to a smaller scale; anticipate how climate changes are likely to manifest in the local environment; present design team with a range of possible scenarios. 4. Select a combination of no-regrets and resilient adaptation strategies: Choose strategies that enable the project to achieve and maintain performance goals, under all possible futures, for the expected life of the project. Incorporating Climate Adaptation into Existing Buildings Green building and climate adaptation strategies must be applied to existing buildings as well as new building projects. Borrowing from the ICLEI process, the steps below describe how a project team can integrate adaptation strategies to existing buildings and sites. 1. Understand regional impacts: Identify climate impacts for the building’s region. 2. Evaluate current operation and maintenance targets: Understand how the maintenance and operations perform under current peak climate conditions. 3. Conduct a scenario analysis: Analyze how the building will respond to projected climate impacts, modeling different system options under a variety of climatic conditions. 12",

Implement adaptation strategies: Install adaptation strategies that provide passive or efficient responses to more extreme climate events in order to maintain occupant comfort while preventing increased energy use.

        "3. Understanding Climate Change: Global, Regional, and Local Impacts The global climate is changing and the early effects have already been observed (USGCRP 2009). Key reports from the IPCC, the USGCRP, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) analyze the forces behind climate change and predict the future climate we are likely to face. Understanding these drivers is the first step toward understanding what a change in climate means for green building professionals operating at the city, neighborhood, and building levels. This section of the report provides a broad overview of the science of climate change and describes the impacts expected at the regional, neighborhood, and building scales. Appendix A complements this section by defining key terms used in the literature. Appendix B lists specific impacts for each region of the United States, and outlines related impacts on the built environment. Greenhouse Gases The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is driving the increase in global temperature and other climatic changes. There are both natural and anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases. Transportation, commercial and residential building, and industrial sources all contribute significant amounts of greenhouse gases. In the U.S. they contribute 36%, 37%, and 28%, respectively (U.S. Energy Information Administration 2009). These heat-trapping gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, tropospheric ozone, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), water vapor, and aerosols (Forster et al. 2007). A low level of radiated heat from greenhouse gases is a natural phenomenon. However, since the industrial revolution, which began in the mid-1700s, concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO ), methane (CH ), and nitrous oxide (N O) in 2 4 2 the atmosphere have increased significantly and caused an increase in global average temperature (USGCRP, 2009). Today, atmospheric concentrations of these three gases are higher than at any time in recorded human history and are increasing at exponential rates, as illustrated in Figure 1. 14",
        "Figure 1: Concentrations of Atmospheric Greenhouse Gases over the Last 2000 Years (Source: http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-2-1-figure-1.html) Of these gases, CO is the greatest total contributor to warmer temperatures because of its 2 high concentration in the atmosphere, strong radiative forcing (restriction of outgoing infrared radiation), and long life span (Forster et al. 2007). Atmospheric concentrations of CO are 2 believed to have remained between 200 and 300 parts per million (ppm) for 800,000 years, but then rapidly increased to approximately 387 ppm in recent years (The World Bank 2010). CO 2 levels have increased by 35 percent since the start of the industrial revolution (USGCRP 2009), and concentrations continue to increase at an accelerated rate in the atmosphere (The World Bank, 2010), where CO persists for up to 200 years (Snover et al. 2007). 2 The atmospheric concentration of CO is affected by the natural cycle of release and 2 uptake. Oceans, vegetation, and soil can absorb CO . However, this “carbon sequestration” is 2 only temporary, and these “sinks” may lose capacity as the climate continues to warm. For example, thawing permafrost will likely release CO that has been tored for thousands of years, 2 potentially initiating a feedback loop in which more carbon is released to the atmosphere (USGCRP 2009). There is a growing consensus in global policy and scientific circles that stabilizing emissions at a level associated with a 2ºC (3.6ºF) average warming is required to prevent the 15",
        "most severe impacts of climate change to human and natural systems (The World Bank 2010). In order to stay within this 2ºC limit, in the long term, CO concentrations need to stabilize near 2 current levels (USGCRP 2009). To help envision the range of possible futures, the IPCC developed 40 baseline emissions scenarios showing different paths for greenhouse gas emissions from 2000 to 2100, based on variations in climate change factors. These scenarios assume no international policies to mitigate emissions (Nakicenovic et al. 2000) and they indicate that annual emissions could increase or decrease from today’s level of approximately 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO e) 2 to anywhere between 30 and 140 gigatons. Temperature increases associated with these emission levels range from 1 to 7 degrees Celsius (Bernstein et al. 2007). Figure 2: Scenarios for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from 2000 to 2100 (Source: http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/figure-spm-5.html) 16",
        "Observed and Predicted Global Climate Change Impacts The early effects of global climate change can already be observed in changes to weather related hazards, hydrology and water resources, coastal processes, biological systems, agriculture, forestry, and human health (C. Rosenzweig et al. 2007). Some examples of observed effects include (relative to historical norms): • Higher temperatures • Increase in the number and size of drought-prone areas • Higher intensity of storms • Sea level rise • Accelerated rates of coastal erosion • Increased water salinity and suspended solids • Increased river runoff The effects of climate change will likely be more extreme than what we have observed so far. With each additional increase in the global mean annual temperature, the severity of effects are likely to worsen. However, the impacts of climate change will not be equally distributed among all locations (USGCRP 2009). Because of this, it is important for green building professionals to understand how climate change will impact the regions where they work. U.S. Regional Climate Change Impacts Understanding how global climate change is likely to affect the region where a project is located is an important first step in anticipating effects on the built environment, modifying project outcomes, and selecting appropriate response strategies. Regional climate impacts fall into six general categories: 1. Temperature 2. Water/Precipitation 3. Coastal Effects 4. Air Quality 5. Pests 6. Fire 17",
        "These impacts have been the topic of significant research, compiled most recently by the USGCRP in 2009, and reported in detail by region in Appendix B of this report. The direction and degree of these impacts vary significantly by region and will result in a diverse set of challenges across different regions of the U.S. The USGCRP divides the nation into eight regions (plus coasts) as indicated in Figure 3. In this report, we include coastal impacts within the regions where they are located. Figure 3: Regions of the United States (Source: http://www.globalchange.gov/) Rising average temperatures are predicted in all U.S. regions and will influence many other climate change impacts, such as precipitation patterns. Higher temperatures will likely lead to more extremely hot days (over 90 degrees Fahrenheit) and an increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves. In many regions, these effects will likely be felt most during the summer months. Precipitation patterns are also likely to change as a result of higher temperatures, but the effects will vary widely by region. The Southwest is likely to see a decrease in overall precipitation and to experience longer, more frequent, and more severe droughts. Meanwhile, the Midwest is likely to experience less frequent but more intense storms, and an associated increased risk of flooding. In general, researchers are much less certain how climate change will impact precipitation patterns than average temperatures (USGCRP 2009). 18",
        "Coastal areas are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to rising sea levels, falling lake levels, and more intense tropical storms. As temperatures rise and polar ice melt accelerates, sea levels are predicted to rise, resulting in potentially disastrous effects for low-lying areas. Of particular concern is the vulnerability of coastal areas to inundation from storm surges during severe tropical storms and hurricanes. Rising sea levels will not affect all coastal areas equally. In general, the Atlantic Coast and Gulf Coast are more vulnerable due to their relatively flat topography and high rates of land subsidence in some areas. Sea level rise is less of a concern in some parts of the Pacific Northwest where land is rising due to tectonic activity. In the Midwest, inland and Great Lakes water levels are predicted to decline due to reductions in winter ice cover and increased evaporation, despite a predicted increase in total rainfall (USGCRP 2009). Climate change will likely result in many more diverse and region-specific impacts including increased risk of wildfires, invasions of pests, and degradation of surface air quality. These and other impacts are often linked. For example, warmer winter temperatures may be contributing to the death of Pacific Northwest pine forests as more insects survive winter conditions (Ryan 1991). The increased number of dead trees within the pine forests may also result in more frequent and intense wildfires that could threaten nearby buildings and degrade air quality. While changes in average precipitation and temperature patterns are important information for projecting impacts, the primary concern for green building practice is the impact that increasing severity and variability of weather patterns and climate will have on the local built environment. Appendix B contains important quantitative estimates of change in these affected categories through the end of the century. Please refer to this resource for more details on region-specific climate change predictions. Whenever possible, we report numbers as a range of possible changes. The most relevant numbers for design will be the upper and lower bounds, which represent the most extreme possibilities within the plausible range. Determining Impacts at the Neighborhood or Building Level Climate is the long-term average weather conditions of a region or place. Regional climate change predictions are useful for understanding general changes in weather and climate- 19",
        "related conditions, but more information is often needed to determine how these forces will affect a specific site or project. Local features (like a mountain or a large lake) can significantly influence weather patterns, and local features such as topography or distance from a coast can have important implications for climate change predictions (Wilby et al. 2004). Two types of resources are available to green building professionals who seek finer-grained detail on climate change impacts: downscaled climate models and historical analysis of severe weather events. When available, downscaled state/local climate change assessments are the best sources of this information. Downscaling is a statistical process used to convert global or regional models to smaller geographies and to account for local features. Climate scientists have only recently begun producing downscaled climate models at the local level with sufficient accuracy to be useful to building professionals. Few cities have devoted the significant resources required to create locally downscaled climate change projections – instead, local climate action plans usually rely on the same regional sources cited by the USGCRP and used in this report. Some states (e.g. California) have developed resources that may reduce the uncertainties reported in the regional assessments. Finer resolution data at the metropolitan level may be available in the near future, and these data may further narrow uncertainty about climate impacts. However, some uncertainty will always exist because of natural weather pattern variability and because many climate change drivers are influenced by human behavior. Regardless of whether downscaled local climate change predictions are available, additional work may be needed to assess neighborhood- and site-level vulnerability. One strategy is to use local knowledge of recent events. When ICLEI (see section 2.3) works with local governments to help them plan for sustainability and climate change adaptation, it recommends focusing on past extreme weather events and anecdotal accounts. When combined with regional climate change predictions, local historical accounts enable governments to envision how prepared they would need to be to respond to similar future events that are more frequent or more severe (ICLEI-Canada, 2010). Green building professionals should follow a similar process but tailor their approach to the specific concerns at the neighborhood or building level. 20",

        "4. Climate Change Impacts on the Built Environment Distinct climate change impacts are associated with the regional, city, neighborhood, and site scales. This section of the report reviews literature that focuses on anticipated climate change impacts and the quantitative effects of these impacts on the built environment. Given the regional nature of both climate change impacts and urban systems and development, further localized research is needed on the impacts and effects of climate change on the built environment. Regional Scale Impacts The regional scale involves the broader urban area(s) and the various systems implemented in support of the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the area. While numerous elements are susceptible to climate change impacts, discussions of regional effects tend to focus on energy, water, and transportation systems. These three regional systems provide cities, neighborhoods, and buildings with essential services and permit movement and connection. Climate change will have a significant impact on the effectiveness of regional systems. More resilient regional systems will maintain efficiencies across systems and limit conflict. Energy Systems: Climate change impacts on energy systems will affect both energy supply (generation, transmission, and distribution) and demand. Given increased variability in temperature, climate change could result in a need to increase energy supply capacity (Amato, Ruth, Kirshen, and Horwitz 2005). At the regional scale, climate change impacts on the delivery of energy may affect the siting of new facilities and infrastructure and disrupt the transmission of energy (USCCSP 2008). In particular, sea level rise, land subsidence, increased storm severity, and storm surges may constrain the location of future energy infrastructure sites (Perez 2009; USCCSP 2008). The impacts of climate change on energy generation vary significantly by fuel source. However, the USCCSP states that fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation are inextricably tied to reliable and adequate supplies of water for cooling. Additionally, renewable energy sources, particularly hydroelectric and solar thermal systems, are highly dependent on water and are therefore very susceptible to climate change (USCCSP 2008). 22",
        "Climate projections indicate warming trends during both winter and summer seasons. As a result, effects on energy demand will include small reductions in space heating but substantial increases in space cooling (Crawley et al. 2008; Huang 2006; USCCSP 2008). A study of the Chicago region projects a 30 to 60 percent increase in annual Cooling Degree Days (CDD) by 2070 for lower and higher emission scenarios respectively (Perez 2009). Additionally, Franco and Sandstad (2006) find that energy models for California predict increases in annual electricity and peak load demands in all climate scenarios. In particular, the A1FI or “high emissions scenario” for the 2070 to 2099 timeframe shows an increase in annual electricity of 20.3 percent and a peak demand increase of 19.3 percent (Franco and Sanstad 2006). The resulting increase in demand, when combined with a strain on existing generation assets, may increase costs and reduce the reliability of regional energy systems. Water Systems: Existing research on the impacts of climate change on water have primarily focused at the regional level because of the size and intricacies of these systems. The primary effects of climate change on regional water systems are increasing variability in the quantity and timing of streamflow runoff, increased risk of flooding, and diminished water quality (Barlage et al. 2002; Barnett et al. 2004; Hamlet and Lettenmaier 1999; Wilby 2007). The impacts of climate change on regional water systems will intensify conflicts between essential and non-essential water uses, and require regional management to ensure an increase in the quality and reliability of water resources (Barlage et al., 2002). Water supply reliability is one of the most important and therefore most extensively researched effects of climate change on both natural systems and human populations. Projected water resource capacity is highly dependent on regional climate impacts and the existing water system balance between supply and demand. Anticipated changes in precipitation vary dramatically by region. Projections indicate increased precipitation at higher latitudes, rising intensity and frequency of low-precipitation periods for areas prone to droughts, and significant changes in runoff patterns for watersheds dependent on snow-fed rivers. Significant research has focused on climate change impacts on streamflow and water reliability at the regional scale. While a majority of the studies have focused on the western region of the United States, many of the basic tenets and lessons can be applied to areas anticipating similar climate threats. A study on the effect of climate change on water resources in 23",
        "the West concludes, “by mid-century we see that the Colorado River Reservoir System will not be able to meet all of the demands placed on it, including water supply for Southern California\" (Barlage et al. 2002). The variability in water supply levels will result in difficulty meeting domestic, industrial, and agricultural demand; maintaining energy production; and supporting natural systems. Stormwater management is a second fundamental concern when analyzing the impacts of climate change on regional water systems. The increased intensity and frequency of high- precipitation events will likely result in increased runoff and flooding (Wilby 2007). Additionally, future development locations and land use decisions play influential roles in determining future stormwater runoff impacts regionally. Analyzing future regional stormwater runoff patterns involves considering climate change impacts in conjunction with urban development patterns. One such study, performed on the Rock Creek Basin in Oregon, indicates that, given climate change projections, sprawling development patterns increase annual runoff by 5.5 percent compared to the baseline model, while a more compact development scenario results in increased annual runoff by 5.2 percent (Franczyk and Chang 2009). The researchers conclude that while regional development patterns have a significant impact on streamflow and water runoff, climate change is expected to have a greater impact on streamflow than land use change (Barlage et al. 2002; Chang 2003; Franczyk and Chang 2009). As water runoff has a strong connection to flood risk and damage in urban areas (Ashley et al. 2005), as well as impacts on the health of natural watersheds (Barlage et al. 2002), considering the future effects of climate change is extremely important. Transportation Systems: Transportation via land, air, or water plays an integral role in connecting urban areas internally and externally. Distinct climate threats exist for each transportation sector, and they vary significantly by location. Region-specific climate impacts will primarily affect transportation infrastructure. The climate change impacts of concern for transportation infrastructure include high precipitation events, extreme weather, sea level rise, thawing permafrost, and reduced ocean and lake ice cover (Transportation Research Board 2008). Therefore, climate change can affect transportation systems by decreasing reliability and safety, and by significantly increasing the cost of both operation and maintenance. 24",
        "Neighborhood Scale Impacts Neighborhoods connect individual building sites to the broader city and regional contexts. Furthermore, the neighborhood level is the primary scale at which building professionals can begin to address impacts of climate change. Because there is little existing research on the impacts of climate change at the neighborhood scale, our analysis focuses on applying information gathered through site or regional studies. In evaluating climate impacts at the neighborhood scale, the elements of location, design, and pattern are important to consider. Location is a critical issue, especially in regards to the anticipated climate change impacts of sea level rise, increased frequency and intensity of flooding, and higher incidences of wildfires. While each of these impacts is more common in certain regions, every project team should consider these location-specific climate impacts when making development decisions. Sea Level Rise: Factors that should be considered before building in coastal areas include anticipated sea level rise, potential changes in storm surge, and land subsidence. The range of projections, both high and low, for anticipated rises in sea level should be evaluated for specific locations. While general changing sea level projections are valuable, knowledge of local geology and tidal patterns is necessary for a full understanding of potential risks. For example, a study of the potential impact of hurricanes on sea level rise reports a mean global sea level rise projection of between 19 and 60 cm, with a high emissions scenario resulting in an 80.0 cm rise (Mousavi et al. 2010). Given variability in projections and coastal systems, regional studies and research are necessary to define local effects. It is also necessary to analyze projected changes in storm surge associated with rising sea level. While changes in sea level help identify better location options, a more in-depth measure of risk relates to the potential impact of storm surge. This is especially important for areas currently (or projected to be) affected by hurricanes. Finally, research regarding land subsidence is an element in identifying the climate change risk regarding sea level rise for a specific location. An analysis of projected sea level rise, changing storm surge, and the amount of land subsidence allows for an informed decision when evaluating location choices in coastal areas. Flooding: With increasing frequency and intensity of precipitation due to climate change, the risk of flooding increases. Flood risk is assessed primarily when determining the appropriate location for a specific project or in planning for urban growth. The most effective way to begin 25",
        "accounting for the impacts of increased flooding is to identify the effect of precipitation projections on flood plain calculations and flood event probabilities. Consideration of flood risk when siting a project should identify changes in the planning of ‘at risk’ areas, and in particular how climate change will affect floodplains for 1-in-10, 1-in-50, and 1-in-100 year events. Two elements to consider when assessing climate change impacts on future flooding include changes in precipitation under future climate scenarios and changes to the landscape that could either reduce or increase stormwater run-off. Projections indicate increasingly frequent and intense precipitation events for most regions. Additionally, models taking into account land use planning processes generally show increased runoff resulting from sprawling development patterns and increased use of impervious surfaces (Marsh 2005). Therefore, the combination of more frequent and intense precipitation and continued land development will result in increased flood risk throughout urban areas (Barlage et al. 2002; Chang 2003; Franczyk and Chang 2009). Recent research predicts that flood risk will increase by a factor of at least two (Ashley et al. 2005). Furthermore, direct damage to buildings due to flooding is projected to increase by factors of 2.5, 3.8, and 9.8 for three different rivers within one watershed (Schreider, D. I. Smith, and Jakeman 2000). The variation in risk is due to the specific natural and built environment characteristics of the sub-watersheds. This example illustrates why more location-specific research will be extremely important when considering future development sites. Wildfires: A final consideration when making location decisions is the rising threat of wildfires due to changing precipitation patterns and expanding urban areas. Generally, “climate change that results in drier, warmer climates has the potential to increase fire occurrence and intensify fire behavior” (Y. Liu, Stanturf, and Goodrick 2010). In particular, the incidence of wildfires is highly linked to low-precipitation and low-snowpack climate patterns (Barnett et al. 2004). Furthermore, the sprawling nature of urban areas has led to “the rapid growth of housing in and near the wildland-urban interface (WUI), [which has led to] increases in wildfire risk to lives and structures” (Massada et al. 2009). Thus, with further anticipated growth of urban metropolitan areas, as well as projected climate change conditions that are likely to increase the frequency of wildfires, it is reasonable to assume that fire will pose a growing risk to the built environment. Design teams should consider the projected regional climate impacts that may result in more frequent and intense wildfires when locating buildings, sites, and neighborhoods. 26",
        "Neighborhood Design and Form The design and pattern of neighborhoods that combine to form our cities play an important role in amplifying or dampening climate effects. For example, neighborhood design and development patterns could help mitigate changes in heat and stormwater runoff. In particular, neighborhood design that significantly increases the amount of impervious surfaces while adding little to no vegetation will only exacerbate the effects of anticipated climate change. Research on the regional impacts of climate change identifies compact development as a means of addressing climate change impacts on the built environment. Urban Heat Island Effect: Urban heat island (UHI) effects and extreme heat events are the primary threats resulting from the increasing temperature associated with climate change. Urban neighborhood patterns have a distinct effect on the thermal comfort of local inhabitants during high heat events. Research on the UHI effect shows that higher density development exacerbates extreme heat events, resulting in additional stressors in urban areas (Coutts, Beringer, and Tapper 2010; Hamin and Gurran 2009; Harlan et al. 2006). The design of urban neighborhoods, including large areas of impervious surfaces, lack of shade-producing vegetation, lower albedo materials, and higher concentrations of waste heat sources all magnify the impact of heat events (Bowler et al. 2010; Coutts et al. 2010; Hamin and Gurran 2009; Smith and Levermore 2008; Wilby 2007). Research also indicates that higher UHI effects impact both higher density urban areas and lower density sprawling urban areas (Oke 1981; Smith and Levermore 2008; Stone, Hess, and Frumkin 2010). Higher density and compact development often result in an “urban canyon” pattern that can trap daytime heat and limit the ability of wind and cooler temperatures to reduce heat (Oke 1981; Wilby, 2007). Similar to high-density urban form, a low-density sprawling development pattern has been shown to exacerbate the UHI effect due to extensive impervious and lower albedo surfaces, and a lack of vegetation (Stone et al. 2010). While issues of thermal comfort and heat stress are primarily addressed at the building and site levels, by beginning to identify the impact of neighborhood patterns on UHI effect, a design team can achieve a more holistic approach to address the impacts of heat-related climate change. Stormwater Runoff: Extensive use of impervious surfaces in urban areas amplifies the impacts of extreme precipitation events. As high precipitation events become more frequent and 27",
        "intense, the associated impacts on urban areas and natural watersheds increase greatly. Neighborhood design and material selection have a distinct impact on the level of stormwater runoff. Specifically, largely impervious surfaces and limited vegetation dramatically decrease water's ability to infiltrate, thereby increasing runoff. The extent of the impact is supported by studies reporting that urban patterns of low-density sprawling development have a larger impact on flooding and stormwater runoff than high-density compact development (Franczyk and Chang 2009; Jacob and Winner 2009). Given anticipated changes in climate patterns, professionals should begin to consider the effect neighborhood patterns have on stormwater runoff and flooding. Site or Project Scale Impacts In assessing the impacts of climate change at the site and building level, it is important to draw connections to associated effects at the neighborhood, city, and regional scales. While climate change may have a distinct impact on the built environment at a specific level, many of the associated effects apply across scales. For instance, the primary neighborhood-level effects of increased urban heat island and stormwater runoff will influence site and building performance. Eight significant site-level impacts include landscape, water, stormwater, energy, indoor environmental quality, building materials, increased risk of flood events, and expanding pest ranges. Landscapes: Research indicates that changes in plant hardiness zones will occur as a result of increasing temperatures, more intense and frequent heat and precipitation events, and longer periods between storm events (Parmesan and Yohe 2003). A recent study on the effects of climate change on global natural systems predicts an average systematic habitat shift of 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (Ibid.). Changing precipitation patterns, length of seasons, and average ambient temperature will all be determining factors to consider for climate adapted landscape design. Plant selection will also affect habitat opportunities. A secondary issue relates to the use of greenspace in addressing stormwater runoff and urban heat effects as elements of green infrastructure. Significant research has focused on the effect of landscaping strategies on climate change impacts, particularly on-site stormwater runoff strategies and the urban heat island mitigation effects of shade and evapotranspiration (Berndtsson 2010; Bowler et al. 2010; Gill et al. 2007). Since landscape design and greenspace 28",
        "can lessen the future impacts of climate change, projected changes in landscape infrastructure design and plant species selection will be crucial site-level adaptation strategies. Water: Research assessing the impacts of climate change on water systems has had a regional focus, with little emphasis on the site level effects on human systems. To assess site impacts, our analysis focuses on the projected regional effects and studies on site level water management. At the site level, climate change will primarily affect water consumption patterns and management of stormwater runoff. Consumption Patterns: Water consumption patterns are projected to change in response to increasing temperature, more frequent and intense extreme heat events, and longer droughts (Smith, Howe, and Henderson 2009). If regional streamflow patterns change as anticipated, site level water availability will become increasingly unpredictable. Given increasing demand for and decreasing reliability of water supplies, the potential exists for longer periods of drought and growing controversy over water supply priorities (Wilby 2007). Therefore, great emphasis should be placed on site level water consumption reductions to help balance projected growth in demand with a less reliable supply. Stormwater Runoff: As discussed in the regional and neighborhood sections, climate change will lead to more intense and frequent precipitation, thereby increasing stormwater runoff. While most research focuses on the impacts of stormwater runoff at a city or regional scale, there are site level effects as well. While regional or neighborhood systems can be designed to address stormwater runoff, the primary is site level damage and a localized risk of flooding (Ashley et al. 2005). Warmer Temperatures; Increased Frequency and Intensity of Extreme Heat Events: Building level energy use is likely to change as a result of rising temperatures. As average temperatures increase, cooling degree days will also increase. Energy demands for heating will decrease slightly, but energy demands for cooling will increase significantly (USCCSP 2008), especially on extremely hot days (over 90˚F). Extremely hot days are already major drivers of energy use in buildings, and as extreme heat events become more frequent and severe, energy use will rise proportionately because increases in exterior heat and interior heat gains have a linear relationship (Coley and Kershaw 2010). 29",
        "Increasing energy demands have important implications for building design and operations. Although energy demands are not predicted to increase in the short term (Huang 2006), long-term impacts could be quite different. One study suggests that climate change could increase California's annual electricity usage by 20% by century’s end (Franco and Sanstad 2006). Such an increase would impose significantly higher costs for building operations. Designers should take care to incorporate higher cooling demands into building designs. While all buildings are likely to experience higher heating loads as a result of increasing temperatures, the degree to which they require additional energy for cooling is related to the design of the building envelope and systems (Coley and Kershaw 2010). Special consideration should be given to design solutions that do not increase building carbon emissions, such as high albedo roofs, green roofs, and enhanced building envelope strategies. Increased Vulnerability to Extreme Heat Events: The frequency and severity of extreme heat events is likely to increase significantly as a result of climate change, affecting building occupant comfort. HVAC systems are currently designed to provide sufficient cooling capacity for the historic climate pattern. If extreme heat events increase dramatically, cooling systems may not be able to continue providing sufficient power to maintain comfort levels. Designers should consider an increased frequency and intensity of extreme heat events when determining needed cooling loads. In particular, designs that allow for future expansion may be prudent. Decreased Ability For Natural Ventilation: Natural ventilation, such as opening a window, is a common way for building occupants to exercise control over personal comfort levels. Ventilation is also used as a natural supplement to forced-air cooling systems, and for low-energy night cooling of buildings. However, as both daytime and nighttime temperatures are predicted to rise, natural ventilation will be a less effective strategy for reducing indoor air temperatures in buildings. Further complicating matters, ground-level ozone concentrations are predicted to increase as daytime temperatures rise and the number of extreme heat events increases. A study of 50 U.S. cities estimated that ozone risk days will increase by 68% per year (Bell et al. 2007). The combination of rising temperatures and the human health risks related to high ozone concentrations may make traditional natural ventilation of indoor spaces a less viable strategy. A UK study estimates that London office buildings and mixed use buildings that rely on natural 30",
        "ventilation will overheat more frequently (5-25% increase for a 1960s-era office building in 2080, and 1.4-3.7% for a more modern mixed-use building in 2020). However, the same study estimated that buildings with advanced natural ventilation may experience no increase in overheating through 2080 (Hacker and Holmes 2007). Building Materials: There are few comprehensive studies on the projected impacts of climate change on building materials. However, some region specific reports focus on certain climate threats. Existing literature and reports indicate that building materials will be most affected by more intense and frequent storms, increased flooding, and changing regional pest ranges (Roberts 2008; Wilby 2007). The durability, design, and testing of building materials are primary considerations when accounting for anticipated climate change. Increased Frequency and Intensity of Storms: We can look to the extensive research on the impact of storms, primarily hurricanes in the Southeastern region of the U.S., to begin assessing the affects of climate change on building materials. A detailed report following Hurricane Ike identifies roofing and wind-driven water as primary threats to building materials. The report outlines specific roofing recommendations, including the need “to assess actual performance of roofing products and systems in order to improve material production and installation specifications.” Furthermore, recommendations regarding wind-driven water call for better water intrusion management, “through a combination of structural improvements and more realistic testing” (Institute for Business and Home Safety 2009). The report provides detailed roofing and envelope strategies to address the impacts of high wind and extreme precipitation resulting from intense storm events. While the Hurricane Ike report is a region-specific response to a single weather event, it exemplifies the type of research useful in determining the region- specific impacts of climate change on building materials. Increased Risk of Flood Events: While location choices and neighborhood patterns play an important role in alleviating flood risk, building material decisions will also be affected. In anticipation of increased site level flood risk, recommendations include choosing building materials that are more durable and resistant to water, less susceptible to water intrusions, and relatively inexpensive and easy to replace if flooding occurs (Roberts 2008). Expanding Pest Ranges: Finally, climate change will impact building materials as the warming climate is projected to increase the current climate range for insects (USCCSP 2008). 31",
        "In particular, the increased range for termite habitat will raise the risk of damage to building materials. The range for termites is projected to spread as temperatures increase, especially with anticipated shorter winter seasons when ground freezing helps eliminate termite population (Peterson,2010). Regions with limited termite populations should consider increasing pest issues and damage to wood-based building materials as the climate warms. 32",
        "5. Current Knowledge Gaps According to the USGCRP, there is currently limited knowledge about the ability of communities and regions to adapt to a changing climate. To address this shortfall, research on climate change impacts and adaptation must begin to include complex human dimensions such as economics, management, governance, behavior, and equity. As part of this effort, interdisciplinary research on adapting to climate change in the built environment must take into account the interconnectedness of natural and human systems. Climate change research has typically focused on how changes in temperature and precipitation will affect national and regional systems. Only a handful of studies have examined the effects of climate change at the neighborhood or building scale, and most of these studies are assessments of how upstream changes in natural systems (e.g., snow pack, precipitation rates, stream flow) may eventually impact human settlements (Chang 2003; Vogel, Bell, and Fennessey 1997; Wilby 2008). More research is needed to understand the direct impacts of temperature and precipitation change on neighborhoods and buildings. To understand the impacts of climate change on neighborhoods and buildings, additional downscaling of climate models will be necessary. While the downscaling of climate models is becoming a common practice in the atmospheric sciences, only a handful of studies have attempted to translate data from these models into formats useful for planning and building professionals. One immediate need is \"future\" TMY files for building energy modeling, but other examples include data on precipitation to determine the size of stormwater systems. The downscaling of climate models introduces a high level of uncertainty; these new data will have significant limitations. Working together, atmospheric scientists and building professionals can help to convey this uncertainty and explain the risk of action or inaction to building owners and the public. This may help to open a broader dialogue on how to prioritize resources to respond to climate change, and build support for local mitigation and adaptation efforts. An interdisciplinary approach will also be important for reframing climate change mitigation and adaptation as complementary rather than conflicting goals. While Appendix C of this report outlines a number of adaptation strategies that building professionals can implement to make their projects more resilient, more research is necessary to understand the benefits, costs, and efficacy of each strategy. This could be accomplished by 33",
        "linking data from downscaled climate models with building energy or environmental performance models, but it will also require evaluation of long-term maintenance costs and the effective useful life of each strategy. In addition, little is known about how the interactive effect of multiple strategies might increase or decrease resilience and/or the capacity to adapt. In the last decade, regional analysis of climate change in the United States has focused on the Northeast and California. This has created a wealth of data that has helped cities such as Boston and San Francisco to initiate climate adaptation efforts. Because climate change will affect all of North America, additional research should be encouraged in other regions as well. Special attention should be paid to places where the population may have a limited capacity to adapt. Coordinated efforts to capture lessons learned from the Northeast and California may also allow for rapid advances in local knowledge, and allow for best practices in resilience and adaptation to flourish across the United States. Finally, there is limited research on how climate impacts will affect plant selection for landscape design and shifting pest zones. Building professionals should encourage researchers in these areas to evaluate the possible effects on the built environment. If these potential impacts are ignored, climate change could negatively affect what is otherwise a resilient design. For example, plants are an important component of landscape design for stormwater management. Plants that previously thrived in an area may be vulnerable to new pests that migrated to there because of changes in temperature or precipitation. The most resilient buildings will adapt not only to water and temperature impacts, but also to storm, pest, landscape, and fire impacts. As climate adaptation is incorporated into building design, case studies and lessons learned will help answer these questions and fill gaps in knowledge. 34",

        "APPENDIX A: Defining Key Terms Just as the term green building has different meanings to different people, terms related to climate adaptation and climate mitigation have varying meanings in the literature. The variation is often driven by a difference in scale and time frame. The definitions below highlight the variations in meanings in order to clarify how green building and climate adaptation intersect at the local level. Green Building Green building is the effort to change the way the built environment is designed, constructed, and operated. Green building takes an integrated, interdisciplinary approach from the early planning stages to the operation of individual buildings, neighborhoods, and entire communities (U.S. Green Building Council 2010). This holistic approach considers the entire supply chain from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and deconstruction. Green building is concerned with air quality, energy and water use, human health, waste reduction, pollution, and environmental degradation (U.S. EPA 2011). Therefore, green building is poised to incorporate climate adaptation strategies in order to lessen the negative effects of future climate impacts. Climate and Climate Change The novelist Robert Heinlein once wrote, “Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get.” Climate includes longer-term weather patterns, and variations in elements such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity. Climate change is evaluated by the statistically significant change in the mean state or variability of climate measurements that persists for decades or longer (IPCC 2001). Past climate data is used in the planning and design of the built environment. Climate change will require building professionals to consider both past climate data and projected regional climate impacts. Uncertainty Planning for climate adaptation and increasing the adaptive capacity of a system inevitably involves some uncertainty. Both the IPCC and the U.S. Global Change Research Program are transparent about the level of uncertainty in their assessments and projections (IPCC 2007; A-1",
        "Nakicenovic et al. 2000). The level of uncertainty is presented as a range of likelihoods ranging from very unlikely to very likely (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). The IPCC probabilities are based on quantitative analysis or expert views (IPCC 2007). Similarly, the U.S. National Assessment classifications are based on the collective judgment of the National Assessment Team (USGCRP 2009). Building professionals must accept some uncertainty about climate change as they make design and planning decisions that will be resilient to future conditions. Scenarios One of the best ways to understand uncertainty and make decisions when effects are unknown is through the use of projected future scenarios (USGCRP 2001). The IPCC presents different scenarios of emissions projections considering a range of possible changes in population, economic growth, technological development, and improvements in energy efficiency. The use of scenarios acknowledges that there is uncertainty in the factors that contribute to climate change. Scenarios are an important component of an assessment because they paint a picture of possible alternative futures, incorporating current knowledge and uncertainties (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). Scenarios are an effort to inform decision makers as they attempt to balance risks and costs. Mitigation Mitigation strategies for climate change are different from strategies to “mitigate” or lessen the effects of climate change. In this document, \"mitigation\" means actions that aim to reduce greenhouse gases, for example by increasing the percentage of renewable energy or increasing energy efficiency. In the United States, buildings contribute 39 percent of national CO 2 emissions. Green building is an important strategy to reduce CO emissions by reducing the 2 energy demand of buildings and increasing the efficiency of energy use (U.S. Green Building Council 2010). Mitigation efforts are important because they will reduce the magnitude of climate change, but they should be coupled with adaptation strategies to lessen the impacts of extreme weather events. Mitigation and adaptation can act in synergy so that their combined effect is greater than the effects of efforts were implemented separately (Adger et al. 2007). A-2",
        "Adaptation Adaptation is the adjustment of our built environment, infrastructure, and social systems in response to actual or expected climatic events or their effects. Adaptation includes responses to reduce harm or capture benefits (IPCC 2007). The IPCC outlines three different types of adaptation: • Autonomous adaptation is a normal response to relatively stable, average climate and the natural variable climatic conditions that were common in the recent past (Moser 2009). Future climatic conditions will likely have more extreme variation and autonomous adaptation may not be able to respond within the time frame that change is occurring. This type of adaptation is also referred to as \"normal adaptation\" (Moser 2009) or \"spontaneous adaptation\" (IPCC 2007). • Anticipatory adaptation or proactive adaptation includes actions taken before climate change impacts are observed (IPCC 2007). Anticipatory adaptation is best understood at the local scale as a planned response to a discrete climate event (Brooks, Adger, and Kelly 2005). • Planned adaptation is the result of policy decisions that are motivated by an awareness that conditions have changed or are about to change (IPCC 2007). It includes additional efforts to examine, plan, and implement strategies for climate adaptation (Moser 2009). Present and projected climate change information is used to review how currently planned practices, policies, and infrastructure will respond to the expected change. Effective planned adaptation requires an awareness of the climate impacts, availability of effective adaptation measures, information about these measures, and availability of resources and incentives for implementation. Planned adaptation strategies can be evaluated not only by their potential to reduce current and future climate risks but also by how they support other policy objectives for sustainability (Fussel 2007). Vulnerability Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to and unable to cope with the negative effects of climate change. Vulnerability of a building or other parts of the built environment is the result of age, condition or integrity, proximity to other infrastructure, and A-3",
        "level of service (specifically for a roadway) (CCSP 2008). The impacts of a climate event on a system or piece of infrastructure are mediated by its vulnerability. Risk Risk is commonly defined as the magnitude of an impact and the probability of its occurrence (Blanco et al. 2009). For example, the risk posed to a structure by sea level rise depends on the rate of sea level rise, the structure’s existing vulnerability, and the rate at which the structure can adapt from a behavioral and mechanical perspective. The ability to reduce the risk to a system will depend on the timescale for both implementing adaptation measures and the evolution or occurrence of the hazard (Brooks 2003). Risk is inherently connected to vulnerability, and both terms are complicated by the lack of a common metric for assessment (Blanco et al. 2009). Adaptive Capacity Adaptive capacity takes adaptation one step further by considering the opportunities and barriers to adaptation. Adaptive capacity is a measure of a system’s ability to adjust its characteristics or behavior in order to respond to existing and future climate variability. Increasing adaptive capacity may require investment in a system and/or the creation of strategies to respond to future climate conditions (Brooks, Adger, and Kelly 2005). A system’s adaptive capacity may be restricted by outside factors such as financial constraints and political challenges. Resilience Resilience is the measure of a system to buffer negative climate effects while maintaining its structure and function (IPCC 2007). A resilient system is the converse of a vulnerable system. A resilient system is not sensitive to climate variability and change and has the capacity to adapt (Blanco et al. 2009). In the context of future climate change, a resilient system would be able to operate at its normal capacity given more extreme climate effects such as higher or lower temperatures, greater wind speeds, and increased or decreased precipitation levels. General Circulation Models General circulation models (GCMs) are the most comprehensive models of the Earth’s climate system. These models include the global atmosphere, the oceans, the land surface, and sea ice and snow cover. GCMs are tested by their ability to model existing and historical climate conditions, a process sometimes referred to as \"backcasting\" (USGCRP 2001). Uncertainties of A-4",
        "GCMs include the inability to model physical processes at the appropriate scale, and the difficulty of simulating various feedback mechanisms, for example water vapor and warming, and clouds and radiation (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). The IPCC and the US National Assessment Program use GCMs to provide geographically and physically consistent estimates of regional climate change and the associated potential effects (Nakicenovic et al. 2000; USGCRP 2001). These regional climate change projections can be used to select appropriate climate adaptation strategies.

        "APPENDIX B: Regional Climate Change Impacts The predicted effects of climate change vary significantly by region. In order to design resilient and adaptable green buildings and neighborhoods, it is essential that green building professionals understand how climate change is likely to impact a region, and how these changes will manifest in the built environment. The tables that follow summarize regional climate change impacts drawn from the literature. The information also suggests potential effects on the built environment and ways to measure these effects. The climate impacts presented here are taken primarily from the United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP; formerly known as the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP)). Mandated by Congress in 1990, its mission is “to build a knowledge base that informs human responses to climate and global change through coordinated and integrated federal programs of research, education, communication, and decision support” (USGCRP 2010). The USGCRP includes 13 U.S. departments and agencies, ranging from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), to the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DOD). The USGCRP’s 2009 report, Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States, is the most comprehensive source for information on regional climate change impacts in the United States. It compiles the results of the CCSP’s 21 previous Synthesis and Assessment Products (SAPs), each focused on a key climate change issue. Another important input to the USGCRP report is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. The IPCC is the world’s leading organization for the compilation, review and dissemination of the current “state of the knowledge on climate change” (IPCC 2010). The USGCRP report draws upon many additional external peer-reviewed sources such as the Transportation Research Board, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and regional climate change impact studies. In a collaborative effort led by NOAA, the report was written and reviewed by a group of highly respected scientists in federal agencies, private consulting firms, research universities and Department of Energy national laboratories. Figure B1 shows the flow of research and information that inform the USGCRP report, the source for many of the climate change impacts reported here. B-1",
        "Figure B-1: Sources of Data for Climate Change Impacts Presented in Appendix B Structure of the Climate Impacts Tables The following tables list predicted climate impacts by region. Impacts are presented by category (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and in four time frames: observed by 2010, near-term (2010-2040), mid-term (2040-2070), and long-term (2070-2100). These tables provide predictions about future climate; however, these impacts are by no means certain. Future climate depends on an extremely complex set of variables, some of which are linked to human behavior. Therefore, future climate characteristics are uncertain and often studied using two or more emissions scenarios reflecting different possible futures. Some impacts are reported as a range of values, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in predicting future climate. These tables are designed as reference tools to provide green building professionals with a “first look” at the challenges regions will face under climate change. However, regional impacts may not provide the level of resolution needed to respond to all the risks that climate change poses at the local level. It may be necessary for green building professionals to seek out additional local sources of climate change data and impacts to supplement these data. B-2",
        "Northeast Region Climate Change Impacts The Northeast can expect continued warming and associated climate change effects. Correlated impacts of warming will likely include the following (USGCRP 2009): • Increasing frequency and intensity of extreme heat events • Shorter winters with fewer cold days and more precipitation • Short-term droughts as frequently as once each summer • Sea level rise that exceeds the global average • Increased flooding from more frequent and intense rain events • Reduced snow cover, affecting stream flows The associated impacts of climate change on the Northeast region will likely have substantial economic, social, and environmental ramifications. In addition, the Northeast region contains several major urban areas located in coastal or watershed areas. New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia are the 1st-, 5th-, and 8th- largest Combined Statistical Areas, respectively, in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2009). Thus, the climate impacts of sea-level rise and more intense precipitation will have a substantial impact on the urban centers of the Northeast. B-3",

        "Southeast Region Climate Change Impacts The Southeast should expect increased warming, with the greatest seasonal increase in temperature occurring during the winter months. The impacts of increased warming will be greater temperature increases during the summer, declining rainfall in Southern Florida and in the Gulf Coast States during winter and spring, increased intensity of Atlantic hurricanes, and accelerated sea-level rise. The changing regional climate is expected to have the following impacts (USGCRP 2009): • Increased heat-related stresses for people, plants, and animals • Decreased water availability • Increased damage from higher-intensity hurricanes and associated storm surge • Sea-level rise Over the next 50 to 100 years, severe heat extremes, water scarcity, and extreme weather events will have a dramatic effect on local urban areas and natural systems throughout the southeast region.

The U.S.- affiliated Pacific and Caribbean Islands are faced with unique and difficult climate change-related challenges. With populations located primarily along coastal regions, island communities are intensely vulnerable. Projections of climate change in the Pacific and Caribbean Island regions anticipate increased temperatures, sea-level rise, decreased year- round precipitation (despite more frequent heavy rain events and increased rainfall during summer months), and a likely increase in hurricane wind speeds and rainfall.

        "APPENDIX C: Adaptation Strategies This appendix provides a set of basic strategies to help a design, construction, and/or operations and maintenance team to incorporate adaptation principles into its project. Less detailed in scope than the Best Management Practices (BMPs) issued by many Federal and State agencies, each of the 81 strategies is provided to encourage a broad discussion of how specific climate impacts should be addressed by a project team. Because of the limited scope and lack of explicit detail for each strategy, teams should to do additional research to implement each strategy into their project. It is best to incorporate these strategies at the beginning of a project, in pre- or schematic design. As a project progresses, teams can utilize the additional information listed at the end of each strategy to follow through on the design, detailing, and construction. Strategy Format Each of the strategies includes the following information: 1. Objective: The purpose of each strategy. 2. Description: A two- to three- sentence description of the strategy and how it responds to climate impacts. 3. Regional Priority: A map of the United States divided into the regions used by the USGCRP in its most recent climate change assessment. Each strategy is designated as a \"high\" or \"low\" priority for that region. If the strategy is not applicable, it is listed as \"N/A\". 4. Primary/Secondary Impact: The primary and secondary impact categories the strategy address such factors as temperature, water/precipitation, pests, fire, storms, etc. For more detailed information on each climate impact category, refer to Appendix B. 5. Measured Effect of Strategy: How each strategy responds to a changing climate, such as a reduction of interior air temperature, reduction in peak electrical demand (kW), etc. 6. Level: Whether the strategy is a \"no regrets\" strategy or a \"resilience\" strategy. A no-regrets strategy is defined as a climate adaptation strategy that will generate social and/or economic benefits whether or not climate change occurs. A C-1",
        "resilience strategy is a climate adaptation strategy that allows a system to absorb disturbances while maintaining its structure and function. 7. Duration: The expected effective useful life of the strategy, measured in years. 8.
