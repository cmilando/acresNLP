I write to submit the attached article, Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble, forthcoming Fall 2021 in the Utah Law Review. In the Article, I argue that markets are not accurately assessing climate change-related risks for an array reasons, many of which would be partially addressed by a mandatory climate disclosure regime. In particular, shareholders and analysts currently lack the fine-grained asset level data they need in order to make climate-risk assessments. Where corporate operations are located, the origins and routes of their supply chains, the sources and quantities of inputs like water and energy –– this is the type of information needed to assess climate risk exposure but is not the type of information currently disclosed in financial reports. Often, the information that is voluntarily disclosed aggregates data at too high a level, is given at widely varying time-scales that make comparison difficult, and fail to differentiate well between exposure and liability. Further, market actors continue to rely on risk assessment methodologies that are outdated in a climate-changed world. They may employ strategies that expose them to model risk, such as relying on unrepresentative historical records to project future exposure. And traditional means of risk assessment may ignore latent risks: The entire capital stock of corporate America was built using engineering specifications designed to endure certain temperature and weather extremes that may be regularly exceeded under a climate-changed world. A facility that was built to withstand a “100-year flood” may now have a much higher likelihood of failure. Additionally, corporate managers may continue to rely on outdated methods of risk assessment that suffer from a duration mismatch. Insurance premiums are reassessed annually, and so could spike suddenly to reflectunaccounted-for climate risk; yet they are nevertheless relied upon as a proxy for the cost of risk for investments with expected returns over many years. Any mandatory climate risk disclosure regime has to meet climate science where it is. Regulators must pay particular attention to the spatial and temporal scales of requested disclosures, and ensure they are both scientifically feasible, and tailored to industry-specific needs. An overemphasis on false precision provided by complicated models might obscure the usefulness of other methods of risk assessment and communication. In crafting disclosure regulation, the SEC should seek out climate-related expertise through interagency working groups, advisory boards, and staff hiring. Finally, I wish to highlight that while investors continue to shift their money into funds with an “environmental, social, and governance” (ESG) focus, perhaps suggesting an awareness of climate risks, there is insufficient scrutiny of index providers and their climate-related methodologies. I welcome the opportunity to discuss these comments with the Commission or the Commission’s Staff. Thank you for your consideration. Respectfully, Madison Condon cc: Hon.

Allison Herren Lee, Commissioner, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Hon. Caroline Crenshaw, Commissioner, U.S. Securities and Exchange CommissionMARKET MYOPIA’S CLIMATE BUBBLE Madison Condon* A growing number of financial institutions, ranging from BlackRock to the Bank of England, have warned that markets may not be accurately incorporating climate change-related risks into asset prices. This Article seeks to explain how this mispricing can exist at the level of individual assets, drawing from scholarship on corporate governance and the mechanisms of market (in)efficiency. Market actors: 1. Lack the fine-grained asset-level data they need in order to assess risk exposure; 2. Continue to rely on outdated means of assessing risk; 3. Have misaligned incentives resulting in climate-specific agency costs; 4. Have myopic biases exacerbated by climate change misinformation; and 5. Are impeded by captured regulators distorting the market. Further, trends in institutional share ownership reinforce apathy toward assessment of firm-specific fundamentals, especially over long-term horizons. This underpricing of corporate climate risk contributes to the negative effects of climate change itself, as the mispricing of risk in the present leads to a misallocation of investment capital, hindering adaptation and subsidizing future fossil combustion. These risks could accumulate to the macroeconomic scale, generating a systemic risk to the financial system. While a broad array of government interventions are necessary to mitigate climate-related financial risks, this Article focuses on proposals for corporate governance and securities regulation—and their limits. Signals from the Biden Administration suggest that mandatory climate risk disclosure regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission is forthcoming. This Article argues that climate risk disclosure is necessary, though alone not sufficient, to address the widespread disregard of corporate climate exposure. * Associate Professor, Boston University School of Law.

INTRODUCTION In 2016, a duo of computer scientists undertook the laborious task of creating a map of U.S. Internet infrastructure, indicating where cable was laid and where colocation centers were based.1 Because the whereabouts of this privately-owned infrastructure is kept secret by telecommunication companies, the researchers spent years scraping the web for scattered publicly available information about infrastructure location.2 When one of the researchers showed the results of his work to his wife, a climate scientist, she immediately remarked that much of the infrastructure was located in coastal regions at risk to be inundated by sea-level rise as soon as the coming decade. All three scientists then worked together, publishing a study showing that thousands of miles of fiber optic cable, and more than a thousand nodes of key Internet infrastructure, could be underwater in the next 15 years.3 The researchers also identified which providers had the most infrastructure at risk, concluding that AT&T and CenturyLink were the most exposed to the risks of sea-level rise.4 Any investors in these two companies paying attention to the 2018 study were likely surprised by its findings: neither of these companies’ recent 10K filings, meant to disclose potential risks to investors, had made any mention of sea-level rise.5 Their voluntary reporting of climate risks to the nonprofit CDP similarly omitted any mention of flood risk.6 * * * A growing number of financial experts at institutions ranging from BlackRock, to McKinsey, to the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, have reached 1 Alejandra Borunda, The Internet Is Drowning, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC (July 16, 2018). 2 Id. 3 Ramakrishnan Durairajan, Carol Barford & Paul Barford, Lights Out: Climate Change Risk to Internet Infrastructure, ANRW ‘18: PROCEEDINGS OF THE APPLIED NETWORKING RESEARCH WORKSHOP 9 (2018). 4 Id. 5 CenturyLink, Inc., Annual Report (Form 10-K) (Feb. 22, 2019), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892619000006/ctl2018123110k.htm; AT&T, Inc., Annual Report (Form 10-K) (Feb. 20, 2019), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000732717/000119312519045608/d705958d10k.htm. 6 CenturyLink’s 2017 voluntary disclosure of climate risks to the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”), the company made no mention of sea level rise. In 2018 it updated its disclosure to acknowledge rising sea levels as a long-term risk with an impact valued at $2 million, see CenturyLink - Climate Change 2018, CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT (2018), https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=62255737&discloser_id=73 8433&locale=en&organization_name=CenturyLink&organization_number=31497&program=Inv estor&project_year=2018&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2Fft9rgfb w%2F15343&survey_id=58150509. 3Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble the conclusion that markets are not accurately assessing and pricing climate change- related risks. In April 2019, a coalition of 42 central banks recognized that “there is a strong risk that climate-related financial risks are not fully reflected in asset valuations.”7 Christine Lagarde recently warned that central bankers “will have to ask themselves” if they are “taking excessive risk by simply trusting mechanisms that have not priced in the massive risk that is out there.”8 According to one survey, 93% of institutional investors agree with her that climate risk “has yet to be priced in by all the key financial markets globally.”9 Yet while the consensus (and evidence)10 grows that assets are mispriced, there has been less attention paid to diagnosing why that might be; what are these faulty “mechanisms” that Lagarde says are not to be trusted?11 This Article seeks to explain how this mispricing can exist at the level of individual assets, disputing academic claims that climate risks are “already reflected in market price[s].”12 Contrary to recent arguments in the corporate law literature, there is in fact ample reason to believe that equity analysts “are systematically less able to assess the valuation impacts” of climate risks.13 First, shareholders and analysts currently lack the fine-grained asset-level data they need in order to make climate-risk assessments.14 Where corporate operations 7 NETWORK FOR GREENING THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, A CALL FOR ACTION: CLIMATE CHANGE AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL RISK 4 (Apr. 2019) [hereinafter NGFS, CALL FOR ACTION]. 8 Carolynn Look, Lagarde Says ECB Needs to Question Market Neutrality on Climate, BLOOMBERG (Oct. 14, 2020), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-14/lagarde-says-ecb-needs-to- question-market-neutrality-on-climate. 9 Climate Change and Artificial Intelligence Seen as Risks to Investment Asset Allocation, Finds New Report by BNY Mellon Investment, BLOOMBERG, (Sept. 16, 2019), https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-09-16/climate-change-and-artificial-intelligence- seen-as-risks-to-investment-asset-allocation-finds-new-report-by-bny-mellon-investm. 10 See infra section II.A. 11 With the noted exception of Jakob Thomä & Hughes Chenet, Transition Risks and Market Failure: A Theoretical Discourse on Why Financial Models and Economic Agents may Misprice Risk Related to the Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy, 7 J.

When “value-relevant” information about a company is withheld from the market, that information cannot be reflected in share price, and so prices diverge from “fundamental efficiency,” or the “correct” price, meaning the discounted present value of expected cash flows from holding the stock. The assertion that stock prices reflect all publicly available information is the “semi-strong” version of the Efficient Capital Markets Hypothesis (ECMH) (the strong version of the ECMH, that prices reflect all information, even information kept internal to the firm, has been widely accepted as untrue). As the following reasons show, this Article argues that with respect to climate risks, markets are both fundamentally inefficient (not reflecting true underlying value) and informationally inefficient (not reflecting information that is already 4Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble are located, the origins and routes of their supply chains, the sources and quantities of inputs like water and energy –– this is the type of information needed to assess climate risk exposure but is not the type of information currently disclosed in financial reports.15 Often, the information that is voluntarily disclosed aggregates data at too high a level, is given at widely varying time-scales that make comparison difficult, and fail to differentiate well between exposure and liability.16 Second, market actors continue to rely on risk-assessment methodologies that are outdated in a climate-changed world.17 They may employ strategies that expose them to model risk, such as relying on unrepresentative historical records to project future exposure. And traditional means of risk assessment may ignore latent risks: The entire capital stock of corporate America was built using engineering specifications designed to endure certain temperature and weather extremes that may be regularly exceeded under a climate-changed world. A facility that was built to withstand a “100-year flood” may now have a much higher likelihood of failure. Additionally, corporate managers may continue to rely on outdated methods of risk assessment which may suffer from a duration mismatch. Insurance premiums, for example, can no longer be relied upon to serve as a proxy for the cost of physical risk on a contemplated project; returns are calculated over many years, but premiums can change annually to reflect previously unpriced risk. Third, corporate managers, with an eye toward maintaining a high share price, have little incentive to discover and disclose information that might reveal their company’s stock price is overvalued.18 Equity-based compensation and firm- specific executive remuneration metrics may encourage managers to focus on the publicly known, or knowable with presently available data and analytical tools).

However, there are actions within the power of both market actors and government regulators that can help to counter the unfolding market failure that is the continued neglect of assessing companies’ exposure to foreseeable climate risks. Net global sea-level rise over the next 15 years, for example, can be predicted with some certainty, and yet market actors nevertheless seem to disregard these projections when making asset-allocation decisions.27 The widespread underassessment of climate risk may lead to two undesirable economy-wide harms: 1) systemic risk to the financial system and 2) the physical damages stemming from climate change itself, as mispriced equity leads to mis- allocation of investment resources.28 If investors fail to demand risk assessment from companies, managers may be left unpunished by the market when they build homes and hotels in hurricane prone regions too close to the shore, or build bridges to withstand a “100-year-flood” based on a grossly unrepresentative historical record. This mis-investment imposes costs not just on the company and the investor, but on the communities harmed by collapsing bridges and hotel evacuees. Addressing climate-risk neglect will require an array of actions, from regulators and investors alike. Growing calls for mandatory climate risk disclosure, trends in other countries, and signals from the Biden Administration, suggest a mandatory climate-risk disclosure regime may be forthcoming in the United States.29 This 26 Fair Access to Financial Services, 85 Fed.

J. (Feb. 12, 2021); Larry Elliott, UK to Make Climate Risk Reports Mandatory for Large Companies GUARDIAN (Nov. 9, 2020). 7Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble Article supports this agenda, and provides some high-level guidance on how to design regulation to address the drivers of climate risk mispricing. Any mandatory climate risk disclosure regime has to meet climate science where it is. Regulators must pay particular attention to the spatial and temporal scales of requested disclosures, and ensure they are both scientifically feasible, and tailored to industry- specific needs.30 In particular, an overemphasis on false precision provided by complicated models might obscure the usefulness of other methods of risk assessment and communication.31 This fact should inform how the SEC decides to structure climate risk disclosure compliance, including balancing the pros and cons of principles-based versus line-item disclosures.32 In crafting disclosure regulation, the SEC should seek out climate-related expertise through interagency working groups, advisory boards, and staff hiring.33 Further, the SEC should 1. Require methods for addressing uncertainty, including scenario analysis 2. Work with auditors and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and 3. Facilitate disclosure and market response through public provision of climate-risk analytical tools.34 No amount of disclosure, however, can protect the market from climate change. The only path toward financial stability requires halting emissions. The CFTC Subcommittee’s report on Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System acknowledges this and lists reducing emissions as its first recommendation.35 However, direct regulation is also required to address physical risks and adaptation deficits, not just mitigation deficits. Climate adaptation requires planning at the national level. Beyond the “market failure” of emissions externalities, there is a limit to what increased disclosure can facilitate in the face of systemic risks; climate risks remain unhedgeable even with increased information. The Article proceeds as follows. Part II collects evidence of climate mispricing, including empirical studies examining how well the market has priced the 1.1°C of warming that has already occurred and models of climate impacts on portfolios. It then enumerates six distinct drivers of asset mispricing in the climate context, and explains why neither arbitrage nor private ordering through requests for voluntary disclosures can correct these market failures. Part III argues that there is a societal 30 See e.g., Tanya Fielder et al., Business Risk and the Emergence of Climate Analytics, NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE (2021); Standards Overview, Sustainability Accounting Standards Bd. 31 See e.g., Fielder et al., supra note X. 32 See note X infra, discussing Allison Herren Lee, “Modernizing” Regulation S-K; Ignoring the Elephant in the Room SEC Public Statement (Jan. 30, 2020). 33 See MADISON CONDON, SARAH LADIN, JACK LIENKE, MICHAEL PANFIL, & ALEXANDER SONG, MANDATING DISCLOSURE OF CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL RISKS, INSTITUTE FOR POLICY INTEGRITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND (2021). 34 See section IV.A infra. 35 CFTC REPORT, supra note X at X. 8Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble interest to correcting this mispricing, beyond individual investor protection, as the inaccuracy may lead to: 1) systemic risk to the financial system and 2) the physical damages stemming from climate change itself, as mispriced equity leads to mis- allocation of investment resources. Part IV discusses recommendations for regulators and investors. Part V concludes. II. CLIMATE RISK AND EQUITY-MISVALUATION Climate risks facing the private sector are typically broken down into three categories: transition risk, physical risk, and liability risk.36 Transition risk comes from a failure to adapt in time to a changing, less carbon-intensive economy as governments begin to regulate emissions, and alternative energy falls in price. “Stranded assets” in the fossil fuel industry are the classic example of transition risk.37 Physical risks are the threats faced by all industries that come from the changing climate itself. They include the impact of sea-level rise on the real estate industry, decreased labor productivity from hotter days, reductions in agricultural output due to droughts or floods, and many others.38 Liability risks are the potential that the parties that contribute to, or profit from, carbon emissions, are required at some point in the future to compensate those harmed by climate impacts.39 36 These are the categories identified by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, see Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, International Climate Risk Conference for Supervisors, De Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam: A Transition in Thinking and Action (Apr. 6, 2018). 37 Christopher McGlade & Paul Ekins, The Geographical Distribution of Fossil Fuels Unused When Limiting Global Warming to 2°C, 517 NATURE 187 (2015) (estimating that in order to keep warming below 2°C, “approximately 35% of current oil reserves, 50% of gas reserves, and nearly 90% of coal reserves are unusable”); Mark Lewis et al., Energy Transition and Climate Change: Stranded Assets, Fossilised Revenues, KEPLER CHEUVREUX 16 (2014) (calculating that if greenhouse gas are kept below 450ppm of CO2 equivalent in the atmosphere, the fossil fuel industry will lose $28 trillion in projected revenue through 2035, with the oil industry experiencing a 22% total decline in revenues); EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD, TOO LATE, TOO SUDDEN: TRANSITION TO A LOW- CARBON ECONOMY AND SYSTEMIC RISK, ESRB ASC REPORT No. 6 (Feb. 2016); Thomas Lee, Fossil Fuel Stranded Assets: Efficient Market or Carbon Bubble?, PENN WHARTON PUB.

See generally THE RISKY BUSINESS PROJECT, RISKY BUSINESS: THE ECONOMIC RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE UNITED STATES (2014). 39 Lawsuits against emitters are increasing in frequency and gaining more traction in the courts. See, e.g., Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v. BP, 388 F. Supp 3d 538 (2019), cert. granted, 141 S. Ct. 222 (2020); Conservation Law Foundation v. ExxonMobil, No. 1:16-cv-11950-MLW Dkt. 29, (D.

Hank Paulson, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and CEO of Goldman Sachs, wrote in a McKinsey newsletter in 2015: “As someone who has spent a good deal of time assessing risk and dealing with crises, I’m struck by the similarities between the climate crisis and the financial crisis of 2008.”40 The world’s largest asset management company, BlackRock, agreed: Many equity investors ignore climate risk, and credit investors and ratings agencies do not routinely assess it. Real estate markets often ignore extreme weather risk, even in highly exposed coastal areas. Most asset owners do not measure their exposure to potentially stranded assets such as high-cost fossil fuel reserves that may have to be written off if their use is impaired by climate change regulation. Who can blame them? There is little evidence that assets more susceptible to climate change and related regulatory risks trade at a discount to the market.41 In the six years since these statements were made, each of these actors—equity analysts, ratings agencies, asset owners, and corporate managers—have made slow progress toward integrating climate change into analyses of financial risks.42 Evaluating climate risk involves forecasting macroeconomic energy demand, guessing on the success of carbon regulation and future technologies, modeling the relationship between atmospheric gas concentrations and global temperatures, predicting how temperature rise will change the earth’s climate systems, and calculating how those changes impact physical economic assets.

Each step of estimation adds layers of uncertainty to risk projections. In some cases, particularly those longer-term and macroeconomic, the estimation of the economic impact of climate change may be dwarfed by this uncertainty.43 However, this Article focuses on climate risks at the scale of individual corporations and investors and their horizons. It argues that the market is neglecting to respond to foreseeable risks. A. EVIDENCE OF MISVALUATION Evidence that the market is currently under-assessing climate risks comes in several forms. There are recent attempts by large institutional market actors to model the impact of carbon regulation and climate damages onto a representative market portfolio. There are also a handful of empirical studies examining how well the market has priced the climate-related impacts we have already been experiencing. Added to these relatively scarce forward-looking and backward- looking studies, are abundant anecdotal examples of market actors failing to prepare for climate impacts. In April 2019, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock released its investigation into the pricing of physical climate risks in three different categories of investments: municipal bonds, commercial real estate, and equities of electric utilities.44 The research was conducted alongside the climate-risk consultant Rhodium Group, and concluded that for each investment type, the market was failing to price asset exposure to the predictable increase in severe weather events and rising seas.45 In the case of municipal bonds, the report pointed out, for example, that declines in crop yields from increased temperatures, could be expected to depress the GDP of many metropolitan areas by multiple percentage points.46 Given cumulative damage impacts, BlackRock predicts that “within a decade, more than 15% of the current S&P National Municipal Bond Index (by market value) would be issued by [metropolitan areas] suffering likely average annualized economics losses of up to 0.5% to 1% of GDP.”47 Nevertheless, when these climate-sensitive bonds are compared to bonds issued by less climate- 43 THE GREEN SWAN, supra note X, at 3; Martin L.

In a 2°C scenario, which models a world with aggressive regulation of emissions that reaches net zero emissions by 2070, certain sectors suffer a severe decline in returns in the short term.53 Assets in the oil and gas industry, for example, lose 42.1% of their value by 2030.54 In the 3°C and 4°C scenarios, all sectors other than renewables have negative return impacts to both 2030 and 2050, with annual losses varying from 0.1% to 7.7%.55 Substantial warming has already occurred—around 1.1°C as compared to preindustrial levels.56 The earth’s planetary systems have reacted to this warming in manifest and measurable ways, making the economic impacts of climate change a matter of the present, not just the distant future.

One recent study of publicly traded food companies in 31 countries found that the market did not efficiently incorporate drought trend impacts on profits into stock prices, and estimated the mispricing to be as much as 7%.57 Another looked at the growing frequency of extreme temperature events from 1995 to 2017, and found that high temperatures reduce revenues and operating incomes of individual firms.58 Further, the greater the heat exposure, the greater equity analysts’ estimates deviate from actual financial performance.59 The authors conclude from their findings that “investors do not anticipate the repercussions of heat as a first-order physical climate risk.”60 The climate data firm 427 generates physical climate risk scores for individual firms based on their exposure to operational disruption risk.61 A recent paper shows that a trading strategy employing 427’s heat stress factor over the period from 2008-2018 – by selling high risk firms and buying low risk firms – would have generated returns of 77%.62 57 Harrison G.

And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s governing regulations prohibit them from factoring natural disaster risk into their pricing of mortgages bought from banks.67 Investors can only price the risks that they are aware of, and increasing attention has been paid to the lack of climate-related risk disclosure, leaving investors in the dark.

One recent study found that the total value of aggregated financial risk reported through both voluntary and mandatory corporate disclosures amounted to mere tens of billions of dollars of potential negative impact—at least two orders of magnitude smaller than top-down projections of costs to financial assets.69 According to the UN Finance Initiative public corporations can expect to face about $3 trillion in climate-related losses in the next 15 years alone.70 One recent example of this under-assessed and undisclosed climate risk comes from the California wildfires. In 2018, Pacific Gas and Electric voluntarily disclosed its climate-related risks to the nonprofit CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project).71 The company highlighted climate change driven increases in wildfire risk as a potential liability, and estimated its 2017 claim payouts at $2.5 billion.72 Any investor that relied on this information to be a fair predictor of future liability would be deeply disappointed in January 2019 when PG&E announced it was filing for bankruptcy and facing $30 billion in wildfire liabilities.73 PG&E’s share price fell more than 80% in two months.74 Expected damages from the changing climate extend far more broadly across the economy than mainstream financial news coverage might suggest to the average investor. With warmer days, labor productivity declines, the rate of infectious diseases increases, energy transmission becomes less efficient, wasps nests the size of cars become more common.75 And yet when voluntarily disclosing their environmental risks to CDP, more than 1,000 U.S. manufacturing companies report 68 THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT, THE COST OF INACTION: RECOGNISING THE VALUE AT RISK FROM CLIMATE CHANGE (2015) (reporting $43 trillion loss at high end of loss estimates, under 6°C of warming, which current consensus suggests we will not reach anytime in the next century). 69 Allie Goldstein, Will Turner, Jillian Gladstone & David Hole, The Private Sector’s Climate Change Risk and Adaptation Blind Spots, 9 NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE 18 (2019). 70 UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME FINANCE INITIATIVE, CHANGING COURSE 51 (2019) (modeling a market portfolio of 30,000 companies and calculating value at risk, using a 15 year horizon under a scenario where warming is limited to 2°). 71 PG&E Corporation – Climate Change 2018, CLIMATE DISCLOSURE PROJECT, https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=62255737&discloser_id=77 4751&locale=en&organization_name=PG%26E+Corporation&organization_number=14678&pro gram=Investor&project_year=2018&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys %2Fft9rgfbw%2F11971&survey_id=58150509 (last visited Jan. 20, 2021). 72 Brad Plumer, Companies See Climate Change Hitting Their Bottom Lines in the Next 5 Years, N.Y.

DRIVERS OF MISPRICING An array of financial regulators share the conclusion that financial markets are failing to price climate risks, and this conclusion is supported by the growing number of empirical and model-based studies discussed in the preceding section. Yet, as critics of “sustainability” investing point out, this conclusion appears at odds with the Efficient Capital Markets Hypothesis (ECMH), which suggests that all known, or knowable, financial risks are already priced into the market.78 This next section outlines the drivers of this mispricing, breaking them into six discrete categories: (1) Lack of asset-level data; (2) Model risk and latent risk; (3) Misaligned incentives of corporate leadership; (4) Myopic shareholders and market structure; (5) Misinformation and biases; and (6) Political opposition and regulatory capture. This Article argues that in some cases the market is mispricing risks that are already known, or could be known with present research methods and publicly available data. In other cases, the data need is unavailable to the market and kept internal to the corporation. 1. Lack of Asset-Level Data Shareholders and analysts currently lack the fine-grained asset level data they need in order to make climate-risk assessments.79 Where corporate operations are 76 CDP, MAJOR RISK OR ROSY OPPORTUNITY (2019) (showing that 1041 manufacturing companies report no climate related risk (as compared to 300 reporting physical risks, 326 reporting transition risks, and 472 reporting both)). 77 Parker Bolstad et al., Flying Blind: What Do Investors Really Know about Climate Change Risks in the U.S. Equity and Municipal Debt Markets?

Have the operators of the asset made investments in climate adaption already? Is the asset relatively invulnerable?86 More resilient than industry peers? While companies have access to information regarding their own assets, they may be exposed to significant supply-chain risk. This risk may be impossible to evaluate without disclosure of the location and resilience of the facilities of suppliers and distributors.87 Corporations may rely on key infrastructure, like roads 80 CFTC REPORT 58 (“Some financial institutions may have asset-level data to overlay with physical risk data, for example, a bank providing project finance loans.

Outdated Means of Risk Assessment: Model Risk, Latent Risk, and Duration Mismatch The traditional methods by which market actors assess risk may be particularly prone to failure in a climate-changed world. Financial models, including those impacting capital-allocation decisions within corporations, often rely on historical data to make future projections of risk.89 In the climate context, the future will look very different from the past in myriad ways. Historical data representing a relatively stable climate past cannot be relied upon to predict future risks.90 Future expected risk has to be creatively modeled – a challenge given uncertainties regarding emissions levels, future regulation, changes to the earth’s systems, and socioeconomic feedbacks.91 The failure to adjust risk assessment methods for corporate decisions like crop selection, or the location and resilience of infrastructure, is one example of model risk.92 88 Sarah Whateley, Jeffrey Walker & Casey Brown, A Web-Based Screening Model for Climate Risk to Water Supply Systems in the Northeastern United States, 73 ENV.

Firm managers make decisions about how to allocate their companies’ capital to future investment projects by evaluating the expected future returns of these projects. To do this, they must account for how risky the project is, but current mainstream financial methods of evaluating this risk are not well-adapted to a future of climate extremes. The most common method used for assessing a potential investment is to calculate its net present value by summing all expected future returns over the lifetime of the project and discounting them by the risk-free rate (which represents the time-value of money) and a risk-premium, meant to account for riskiness of the project. This risk premium is rarely assessed by forward looking asset- specific analysis of risk, and instead is typically captured by backward-looking measures of past risk, often assessed at the company (rather than asset) level. See Mohsen Taheri, Mehdi Irannajad 18Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble Another type of model risk associated with climate change is failure to capture extreme unprecedented events. For example, one standard measure that portfolio managers use to estimate potential losses is value at risk (VaR). VaR provides a level of confidence, such as 95 or 99%, that an expected loss will fall within a certain range. But VaR says nothing about the potential magnitude of loss for the extreme event that has a 1% chance of occurring. Given that certain climate risks are highly uncertain, and potentially catastrophic, they may lie in this 1% zone that is likely to be discounted by market actors as “unlikely.”93 This “fat-tail risk” deviates from the normal distribution that market actors may be accustomed to rely on in their models.94 A further potential for model risk comes from misjudging not only the increased frequency and severity of extreme climate events, but also their correlation.95 Large multinationals, like PepsiCo, have operations located around the globe and their size may factor into their traditional approach to risk management: it has been historically unlikely that a hurricane will hit operations in Brazil, Florida, and India & Majid Ataee-Pour, Risk-adjusted Discount Rate Estimation for Evaluating Mining Projects, 4 FINSIA J. APPLIED FIN. 36, 36 (2009) (describing CAPM as the “main method” for estimating the risk adjusted discount rate for mining projects). For example, one common method of approximating the appropriate risk premium is to calculate the cost of capital of similar firms in the same industry relative to the market. This calculation is often done using long term averages of the firms’ stock prices. Kahan, Securities Laws, supra note X at X. In a world of climate change, however, past risk is no longer representative of future expected risk. Approximating a risk premium that accounts for expected climate risk is more challenging, as it requires more information than historical financial data. See, e.g., M.

Climate change exacerbates the already fragile state of America’s aging infrastructure: more than 15 thousand dams (a majority of which are privately owned) have a “high-hazard” potential and 9-25% of bridges are “structurally deficient” without any consideration of climate impacts.103 Finally, some corporate managers, especially of mid-sized or smaller firms, are accustomed to relying on third-party insurance products to assess and price their company’s risk exposure, rather than internal statistical risk management.104 But insurance premiums are typically re-assessed and paid on an annual basis.105 In a world of non-linear climate responses, the price of insurance may dramatically skyrocket from one year to the next, and certain assets may become uninsurable altogether.106 Relying on insurance to price risks of investments that are expected to reap returns decades into the future, leads to a “duration mismatch”107 that may leave these assets stranded without insurance, leading to unrecoverable losses in the event of a disaster.108 102 Susan Palu & Hussam Mahmoud, Impact of Climate Change on the Integrity of the Superstructure of Deteriorated US Bridges, 14 PLOSONE (Oct. 2019); see also U.S. DEP’T OF ENERGY, U.S. ENERGY SECTOR VULNERABILITIES TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND EXTREME WEATHER (July 2013). 103 AM.

Misaligned Managerial Incentives Corporate managers have access to their firms’ operational data, and are likely better positioned, as compared to their shareholders, to assess their firms’ resilience to climate change. However, they may lack personal incentives for seeking out and assessing climate risk, let alone disclosing potential risk exposures to the market.109 The revelation that a firm is exposed to previously unaccounted-for climate risks may lead to a fall in share price that managers are trained, and incentivized, to avoid.110 In some cases, adapting to climate change requires up-front capital expenditures in order to stave off longer-term losses—like the raising or relocation of facilities. But managers that manage to a stock-price set by a myopic market are discouraged from making these investments in the short term.111 The reasons why managers may focus on keeping stock price high in the short term, even if that means sacrificing longer-term fundamental value, have been well explored in the literature. A drop in stock price may open up a manager to the risk of being fired,112 so in the interest of self-preservation she may focus on the demands of myopic shareholders while neglecting to spend resources assessing and mitigating longer term risks to the company.113 Further, executive remuneration is regularly linked with short-term metrics of firm performance, including through compensation in stock, or stock options.114 Evidence suggests that the shorter the time CEOs have to wait before their options vest, the more likely they are to cut investment budgets, personally profiting from the market’s interpretation of short- 109 See, e.g., Armour, Gordon & Min, supra note X at 26-31 (arguing that stock-based, including options-based, executive compensation models incentivize corporate managers to neglect risk management programs, to the detriment of the long-term value of the stock); see also Anat R.

In 2016, the New York attorney general announced it had reached a settlement with Peabody after an investigation revealed the many ways the company had withheld information from investors regarding internal projections for future coal demand.120 While Peabody’s “disclosures denied its ability to reasonably predict the future impact of any climate change regulation on its business… the company and its consultants [internally] projected severe impacts from certain potential regulations that would materially affect Peabody.”121 In another example of potential managerial manipulation, an Exxon whistleblower 115 Tomislav Ladika & Zacharias Sautner, Managerial Short-termism and Investment: Evidence from Accelerated Option Vesting, (U. of Amsterdam, Working Paper 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2286789; Alex Edmans, Vivian W.

(In 2004, under pressure from regulators, Shell downwardly adjusted its estimated proven reserves by 20%, and share prices fell 10%).128 The practice of fossil fuel companies continuing to predict future cash flows from reserves that will likely be left undeveloped in an emissions- regulated world, is consistent with these practices.129 122 Christopher Matthews & Emily Glazer, Exxon Draws SEC Prove Over Permian Basin Asset Valuation, WALL ST.

In the fossil fuel industry, for example, many companies have policies that tie executive bonuses to the “reserves replacement ratio,” meaning the amount of reserves added relative to the amount extracted that year.130 This metric, along with the common practice of linking incentives to exploration and production, rather than revenue is meant to encourage investment in capital projects that may not generate revenues for many years.131 At ExxonMobil, for example, 23% of executive pay is tied to metrics that directly incentivize growth in reserves and production, and another 23% is tied to “indirect growth” metrics like earnings and cash flow.132 But these metrics are now out of synch in a world where long-term capital would best be served by not adding to likely unprofitable reserves. 4.

The corporate governance literature contains a voluminous debate about whether short-term focused hedge funds pressure corporations to be myopic, and if so, whether their longer-term counterparts, institutional investors like asset managers and pension funds, serve as a counter-acting force to this short-termism.134 But this debate has largely failed to grapple with another difference (besides horizon) between long-term institutional investors and short-term focused hedge funds and quant traders: the former are increasingly quasi-indexers who “passively” buy and hold baskets of assets, while the latter make frequent firm-specific trades. Even if institutional investors are able to promote long-termism through governance measures and oversight of management, it is still active investors trading on the margins that determines share price. While roughly 80% of the net present value of a long term investor’s portfolio is based on cash flows expected beyond the five year horizon, most equity analysts make buy or sell recommendations employing risk analyses that fall within the three to five year mark.135 Some of the sectors that are likely to be the most exposed to long-term climate risks, like utilities and real estate, have the largest percentage of their net present values derived from expected cash flows that extend more than 20 years into the future.136 One recent survey asked equity analysts why there was such a focus on the short term, despite the fact that most equity is now held by “long term” investors.137 The analysts reported that disconnect was due, in part, to lack of demand from investors.138 Weak investor demand for long term risk analysis may be explained, in part, by the rise in short-term trading.139 In 1960, the average share of stock was held for 134 Compare Lucian A.

The decision to buy or sell becomes increasingly divorced from an analysis of a stock’s underlying fundamentals, and based more upon “heterogeneous expectations about price movements.”143 Former Delaware Supreme Court Chief Justice Leo Strine has commented that “actively traded funds turn over at a rate which makes it difficult to believe that their managers are basing their decisions on a genuine assessment of the corporations’ long-term cash flow prospects as opposed to their speculation about where the market is heading.”144 It has been empirically shown that increases in stock ownership by shorter-horizon investors is associated with reductions in longer-term investment spending and increased short-term earnings.145 These cuts to spending, like reductions in research and development, (Eur.

Governance Inst., Working Paper 426, 2018), https://ecgi.global/sites/default/files/working_papers/documents/finalroe.pdf (arguing that this assertion is flawed as it misses the fact that “shares are increasingly owned by longer-term investors, even while the remaining short-term investors trade increasingly frequently and thus drive up the average turnover rate.”) While Roe et al. are correct in their assessment of how this might affect corporate governance (managers are beholden to short and long term investors alike), it does not address how this dynamic is likely to affect myopic pricing. 140 Warren Fiske, Mark Warner says average holding time for stocks has fallen to four months, POLITIFACT (July 6, 2016), https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/06/mark-warner/mark- warner-says-average-holding-time-stocks-has-f/. 141 Leo E.

From the perspective of the hedge fund, it makes sense to force a company to sell assets that the market undervalues in the short term. But with carbon regulation increasingly inevitable, the sale may end up damaging NRG’s long-term prospects. The lack of demand for long term risk analysis may be exacerbated by the rise of passive investment strategies, like indexing and exchange traded funds (ETFs).150 At present, around half of US stock held in investment funds are 146 Id.

One way might be to simply calculate and then publicly release information on climate-risk mispricing in the hope that the market responds. One of the first (and still best) studies of physical risk mispricing was produced by asset manager BlackRock.160 Some corporate observers caution that short-term trading based on market volatility, rather than fundamental financial analysis, will lead to “herding effects,” in which individual investors make under-informed trades based on market responses to limited information, such as earnings reports.161 This follow-the-leader game of stock valuation leads to distortions away from efficient pricing. Index investing, is in some sense, the ultimate herd. Recent studies provide some evidence that the growth of passive investing does in fact increase the potential for correlated market effects, but much more research on the issue is needed.162 158 F.

The implication is that this asset allocation decision itself affects price efficiency, as it reflects investor demand. A counter response to this defense is that price efficiency is about individual stocks, not baskets of stocks. Or, if we take BlackRock’s argument that index selection is just another form of active management—impacting price efficiency—then perhaps index providers should be regulated as financial advisors.166 Further, the increasing flow of money into ESG investment products ($20 billion in 2019 only)167 suggests that investors are in fact waking up to climate- related risks and potential mispricing.

As Adriana Robertson has argued, the investor is, in a way, delegating asset allocation decisions to the creator of the ESG index.169 This delegation may come with underexplored agency costs and third-party mediation that obscures price efficiency. Vanguard’s ESG US Stock ETF was called out by the Financial Times for including companies like Kinder Morgan and Marathon Petroleum, despite claiming to “specifically exclude” fossil fuels.170 One analysis of funds offered in the UK found that more than one-third of those marketed as climate or low-carbon focused nevertheless contained oil and gas stocks.171 5.

Why? Because we have had a 30-year, well-funded program to make the problem of climate change seem vague, distant, and problematic. . . . How many [climate] deniers does it take to distort the price?

Federal agency websites have been overhauled to remove the term “climate change,” deleting whole documents and webpages on the issue.175 The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said in a 2017 CNBC interview that he does not believe carbon dioxide to be a “primary contributor” to global warming.176 These efforts have had a well-documented influence on public opinion.177 While an increasing percentage of the population now agrees that climate change is occurring—primarily because of their direct observations of extreme weather— understanding of its causes and effects are poor. In a 2018 survey in Germany, only 31% of respondents correctly answered “no” to the question of whether ocean evaporation due to higher temperatures was predicted to lead to declines in global sea-level.178 Fifty-one percent thought that the ozone hole is the main cause of the greenhouse effect.179 A recent survey asked 439 institutional investors about their assessment of climate related risks.180 Forty percent of the respondents indicated that they expected more than 2°C of warming by the end of the century, and just 12% expected an increase of more than 3°C. This means 60% of institutional investors believe warming will stay below 2°C despite the evidence that even if all countries were to fully meet their emissions targets and pledges under the Paris Agreement, 174 ORESKES & CONWAY, supra note X; MEYER, supra note X.

Climate change, a long-term process not easily discernable in our daily lives, poses a challenge to accurate human threat assessment for a number of reasons. Psychological research has demonstrated that humans suffer from a status quo bias, whereby we not only prefer current conditions but also irrationally assume they will continue.188 This bias may influence shareholders to undervalue the significance of climate risk.189 The rational assessment of climate risk is further muddled by the very nature of information about climate change. Behavioral psychology tells us that information is complicated and “difficult to decipher” is more likely to be discarded as untrue.190 Market actors suffer from a number of heuristics, or mental shortcuts, which can derail the rational processing of complicated information. First, the availability heuristic may cause people to excessively discount the possibility of “black swan” climate events unless they’ve recently encountered salient examples of such events.191 But, by definition, these high-impact low-probability events are unlikely to occur frequently. Investors and managers, failing to find examples of these events in their everyday lives, may irrationally devalue serious climate risks to their companies and portfolios.192 Rational decision making is also stymied by a myopic focus on immediate rewards irrespective of the long-term consequences of those rewards.193 Market actors are predisposed to prefer short term goal gratification regardless of its long 188 See William Samuelson & Richard Zeckhauser, Status Quo Bias in Decision Making, J.

Individuals are influenced by the availability heuristic – the tendency to give greater importance to events that happened recently, or that are easier to recall.196 For this reason, market actors are most likely to imagine a future that looks similar to the recent past, even if it means ignoring broader scientific understanding.197 Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky’s Prospect Theory suggests that company executives may be reluctant to spend upfront capital on climate adaptation measures, even if those measures save the company money in the long run. Under Prospect Theory’s certainty effect, individuals put more weight on outcomes that are certain, and less weight on outcomes that are unlikely, discounting them by more than the rational weighting of their probability of occurrence.198 Thus, managers may overweight the costs of adaptation measures in the present, which have a certain, known, price tag, and underweight expected future climate damages whose magnitude and timing is more uncertain. Managers may be subject to cognitive biases that encourage them to withhold share value-decreasing information. Donald Langevoort argues that, even in the absence of intentional misrepresentation, managers “may subconsciously perceive information in a way, if at all possible, that permits them to maintain consistency with their self-image of efficacy and control, thereby justifying (to themselves and others) preservation of their positions and status.”199 In the face of great uncertainty around the future of carbon regulation, managers may disregard future scenarios for decreased oil demand that are well within the realm of 194 Walter Mischel & Ebbe Ebbesen, Attention in Delay of Gratification, 16 J.

Corporate Opposition / Regulatory Capture Shareholders concerned about climate risk have begun to press for disclosure directly from companies themselves. Their efforts, however, face opposition from corporate management, not only directly, but also through industry influence on government regulators.204 200 In 2016, a small group of Exxon shareholders expressed concern that the company was “eroding shareholder value” through investments in capital projects that would be unprofitable in “a low carbon demand scenario.” They noted that Exxon’s capital expenditures had grown “9 percent from 2005 to 2014, coinciding with a 1 percent net income decline” and that Exxon had cut capital distributions to shareholders (through both dividends and buybacks) by 25 percent in the preceding year. Similarly concerned shareholders of Chevron pointed to a Chatham House report that concluded “the only realistic option” for oil majors is to provide cash to shareholders and “shrink into the remaining areas of operation…where they can earn an acceptable return.” The report noted that this action “would require a major change in [firms’] corporate culture.” 201 Christopher M.

In the thousands of comments the agency received, investors were generally in favor of “more extensive and rule-like disclosure” while corporations were opposed. Business and Financial Disclosure Required by Regulation S-K: Concept Release, 81 Fed. Reg 23916 (Apr. 22, 2016)); 37Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble In response to growing shareholder support for climate disclosure resolutions, the National Association for Manufacturers (NAM) funded the formation of the Main Street Investors Coalition, a group that advocates against the influence of institutional shareholders and their focus on ESG issues. Many fossil fuel executives, including those of Exxon and Shell, sit on NAM’s board of directors.205 The Coalition’s executive director has argued that shareholder climate risk disclosure resolutions are motivated by asset managers’ personal “political objectives” rather than genuine concern for assessing investment risk.206 SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce has similarly spoken out against shareholder advocacy for heightened environmental disclosures, arguing they are motivated by “public shaming” rather than interest in informed investing.207 The Coalition was a vocal supporter of several Trump-era regulations that have the net effect of making it harder for investors to reflect climate risk in their asset allocation decisions. Under Trump, the SEC finalized two rules that limit investor power to press for climate risk disclosure from companies: one that limits the ability of investors to propose and re-propose shareholder resolutions;208 and another that increases issuer power relative to proxy advisory firms that counsel institutional investors on shareholder votes.209 In addition, the Department of Labor amended regulations under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act to require that retirement plan fiduciaries exclusively consider “financial factors” relevant to the Virginia Harper Ho, Disclosure Overload?

MARKET FAILURE While a growing number of investors argue that climate risks remain mispriced, they cannot correct the mispricing on their own. Informed investors are limited in their ability to arbitrage away mispricings, particularly those that are widespread, and for which the timing of market correction is difficult to predict.213 And while investors have made some progress in getting corporations to disclose climate- related risks under voluntary frameworks, these frameworks are insufficient as they provide broad discretion to issuers and little assurance as to accuracy of the information provided. 1. Inability of Market to Self-Correct If there is in fact systemic and irrational investor bias, the ECMH posits that rationally informed arbitrageurs will exploit the mispricing, reaping a profit while bringing prices back to fundamental values.214 However, practical limits to arbitrage in the real world means that the knowledge that asset valuations ignore climate risks does not necessarily enable an investor to make a profitable trade on that information, particularly without knowledge of when these risks will be exposed and repriced. 210 29 C.F.R. pts. 2509, 2550 (2020); Press Release, Ceres, Ignoring overwhelming opposition, Labor Department adopts new rule that will impair ESG investing (Oct. 30, 2020).

It assumes that all investors have access to the same publicly available information and that all investors have homogeneous expectations about future valuations. In the real market, however, investors have access to different amounts of information and may form different forecasts about the future.215 When shareholders hold increasingly heterogenous expectations about the future, “one would expect increasingly inefficient prices, at least as judged by the yardstick of the CAPM.”216 Bill Bratton and Michael Wachter have explained that heterogeneity in shareholder expectations is more likely to occur in situations when shareholders face uncertainty in predicting the future, such as “when there is a change in technology, when glamour companies emerge, or when companies running newer businesses with less established track records become an important part of the market.”217 Climate change presents a similar shift in the status quo that impedes reliable forecasting. Even if some group of shareholders are informed, the speculative aspect of stock price fluctuations might lead them to hold on to their stock rather than sell, knowing that climate skeptics and backward-facing algorithms are going to maintain demand in the immediate future. A well-informed investor may suspect, or even know, that a stock is overvalued and deviating from the true value diminished by climate risk, but she may nevertheless be powerless to influence the trends of the market.218 Why aren’t savvy investors shorting stocks misvalued due to climate risk? And shouldn’t this shorting mechanism itself move prices closer to fundamental value? Some investors are in fact banking on the mispricing.

Moral Hazard Even if markets—that is, managers of financial institutions—could correct the mispricing, their own motivation to do so may be muted by expectations of government bailout. As argued by Graham Steele, banks and other institutions may fail to price in climate-related tail-risks for precisely this reason: that in the event of catastrophic loss, they expect the government to provide funds rather than letting 220 Kate Duguid, Citing Climate Risk, Investors Bet Against Mortgage Market, REUTERS (Sept. 29, 2019) (He tells prospective clients “The market’s failure to integrate climate science with investment analysis has created a mispricing phenomenon that is possibly larger than the mortgage credit bubble of the mid-2000s.”); Diana Quick, Former Subprime Player Claims He Can Now Short the Mortgage Market for Climate and Covid Risks, CNBC (Nov. 23, 2020). 221 See, e.g., Jeff Schwartz, Fairness, Utility, and Market Risk, 89 OR.

Failures of Voluntary Disclosure Standards Shareholders, especially institutional investors, have woken up to the likely mispricing of climate risk in recent years.229 And they have begun to demand the information they need for risk assessment via voluntary disclosures, through open letters to CEOs and votes in favor of disclosure proxy proposals.230 The private sector has come to something of a consensus around the default standard for a voluntary disclosure regime: the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosure (TCFD) produced a reporting framework in 2017 that is meant to be “widely adoptable” and “applicable to organizations across all sectors and jurisdictions.”231 The framework recommends eleven categories of disclosure, organized under four core elements covering governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and 225 Graham Steele, Confronting the ‘Climate Lehman Moment’: The Case for Macroprudential Climate Regulation, 30 CORNELL J.

DISCLOSURES, 2020 STATUS REPORT 68 (2020). 42Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble targets.232 Some investors and experts have pushed for companies to report against industry-specific standards in addition to their TCFD disclosures.233 Voluntary reporting frameworks, however, are an imperfect solution to the problem of inadequate climate risk disclosures. Without enforcement and standardization, companies can pick and choose which reporting frameworks, or categories of risk within those frameworks, they disclose. This is particularly evident in the voluntary disclosure of fossil fuel companies to CDP, who report “more opportunities than risks from climate change.”234 As of 2018, the average voluntarily complying company provided less than 4 of the 11 disclosure metrics recommended under the TCFD.235 Firms have been particularly slow to employ scenario analysis and discuss climate-related operational risk—just 9% discussed the resilience of their business models to climate change.236 And disclosures are far more likely to dwell on transition risks than discuss physical risks.237 These voluntary disclosures remain nonstandardized, and are difficult for stakeholders to analyze and compare across companies.238 A large number of companies simply do not report climate risks through voluntary frameworks or otherwise. One third of S&P 500 companies do not disclose their own (Scope 1) emissions, a relatively uncomplicated metric.239 Further, voluntary climate reporting is subject to a lower level of scrutiny than mandatory financial disclosure, which may impact the quality of the information provided. Among the S&P 500 companies, most sustainability and environmental disclosures lack external assurance and the vast majority of external assurance is done on only a fraction of the information provided.240 As a result of the lack of third-party audits, investors are hesitant to rely on current climate disclosure packaged in “sustainability” reports.

SOCIETAL HARM OF CLIMATE RISK UNDERASSESSMENT Two types of harms are generated by the under-assessment of climate risk: (1) systemic risk to the financial system; and (2) the negative effects of climate change itself, as the mispricing of climate risk in the present leads to an inefficient allocation of investment capital. If investors fail to demand risk assessment from companies, managers may be left unpunished by the market when they build homes and hotels in hurricane prone regions too close to the shore, or build bridges to withstand a “100-year-flood” based on a grossly unrepresentative historical record. This misinvestment imposes costs not just on the company and the investor but on the communities harmed by collapsing bridges and hotel evacuees. A. CLIMATE DAMAGE If the stock market fails to respond to poor managerial decisions like building in flood plains or mis-forecasting supply chain disruptions, capital will be allocated inefficiently.242 This is harmful not just to investors, but to everyone who relies on the goods and services these companies provide as well as those harmed by the externalities they generate. Disclosure of risk enhances “efficiency by improving corporate decisions relating to which proposed new investment projects in the economy are selected for implementation and how already existing projects are operated.”243 The majority of new public company investment comes from internally generated capital rather than funds raised from investors through financial instruments.244 Shareholders monitor the allocation of this capital through corporate governance mechanisms—oversight of managers and directors—rather than project-specific evaluation, and many of these mechanisms rely on share price as a proxy of success. As argued by Kevin Haeberle, inaccurate stock prices thwart 241 242 Zohar Goshen & Gideon Parchomovsky, The Essential Role of Securities Regulation, 55 DUKE L. J. 711, 720 (2006) (“Accurate pricing is essential for achieving efficient allocation of resources in the economy.”); cf. Lynn A. Stout, The Unimportance of Being Efficient: An Economic Analysis of Stock Market Pricing and Securities Regulation, 87 MICHIGAN L. REV. 613, 642-44 (1988) (arguing that “efficient stock markets may be neither necessary nor sufficient for the proper allocation of capital among corporations” partly because most capital is raised outside of the equity markets). 243 Merritt B. Fox, Civil Liability and Mandatory Disclosure, 109 COLUM. L. REV. 237, 253 (2009). 244 See Kevin S. Haeberle, Stock-Market Law and the Accuracy of Public Companies’ Stock Prices, COLUM. BUS. L. REV. 121, 138 (2015). 44Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble shareholders from monitoring management and the use of corporate funds, and reduce “the efficiency with which society allocates its scarce capital.”245 For example, oil and gas companies are currently allocating large up-front capital to the exploration and development of extractive projects that many argue are not net present value justified given projections of future demand in a carbon regulated world.246 Were carbon risks to be accurately priced, it is likely that many of these projects would not be greenlit. One recent report calculates that between 40% and 50% of ExxonMobil’s upstream capital expenditure through 2025 will be spent on developing fossil resources that will be unsellable in a world that effectively implements regulation to limit warming to 2°C.247 Nevertheless, once these projects have been brought online, the expense of development will be a sunk cost. Oil and gas companies may decide to continue to process and sell fossil fuels at slightly above cost in order to recoup some, but not all, of the money spent, rather than abandoning the project entirely. For this reason, the mispricing of carbon risk in the present inefficiently subsidizes the future production of fossil fuels.248 Similarly, managers unpunished by the market have little incentive to invest in adaptation measures, and may neglect to spend money on elevating their factory, or investing in alternative energy sources, or researching heat resistant crops.249 Poor capital-allocation decisions made today will have long-lasting effects, 245 Id. 246 Martin & Kemper, supra note x. 247 CARBON TRACKER INITIATIVE, 2 DEGREES OF SEPARATION: TRANSITION RISK FOR OIL AND GAS IN A LOW CARBON WORLD 24 (2017) (predicting that Exxon is the most exposed of the world's oil and gas firms to wasted capital expenditure if the atmospheric CO concentration is kept below 450 2 ppm). 248 See Andrea Liesen, Climate Change and Financial Market Efficiency, 54 BUS. & SOCIETY 511, 531 (2015) (explaining, “In the state of inefficiency evidenced in this research, the stock market does not correctly incorporate the climate-change-induced systematic risk of European companies when allocating ownership of capital stock. As the (incorrect) valuation of financial assets strongly affects the investments in assets in the real economy…capital is allocated inefficiently.”); Robert Barro, The Stock Market and Investment, 3 REV.

SYSTEMIC RISK One harm that stems from the failure to assess climate risk is the systemic nature of the risk itself.251 The primary way that academics and regulators have discussed the systemic nature of climate risk is through its possibility to cause a contagion of financial failures.252 If certain industry stocks are indeed overvalued due to the financial sector’s failure to account for climate risk, the market may gradually adjust the mispricing in a slow price decline as it incorporates new information. Or, the market may correct suddenly, resulting in chain-reaction effects throughout the financial world. The more asset prices diverge from fundamentals, the higher the likelihood of a large and sudden realignment, a.k.a., a bubble burst.253 A recently published “climate stress test of the financial system” calculated that 6 percent of the average investment fund’s equity holdings are in the fossil fuel industry, while an additional 36 percent are in “climate-policy relevant” sectors, including utilities, mining, housing, and transport.254 If each of these industries has failed to assess and disclose their exposure to climate risk, this amounts to a great deal of unaccounted risk that accumulates at the portfolio-level.255 250 JAMES WILLIAMS ET AL., SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS NETWORK, POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF DEEP DECARBONIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 54 (2015). 251 See KERN ALEXANDER, RAHUL DHUMALE & JOHN EATWELL, GLOBAL GOVERNANCE OF FINANCIAL SYSTEMS: THE INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF SYSTEMATIC RISK 24 (Oxford Univ.

L.J. 193, 198 (2008) (explaining that systemic risk can derive from aggregate risk taking on the part of many individuals because “like a tragedy of the commons, no individual market participant has sufficient incentive, absent regulation, to limit its risk taking in order to reduce the systemic danger to other participants and third parties”). 46Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England, has referenced the need to avoid “a climate Minsky moment,” cautioning that “sharp changes in valuations” of energy company securities due to unanticipated market and regulatory changes can have domino-effects throughout the financial sector.256 Several heads of other central banks agree with him that a “sudden collapse of asset prices” is possible.257 Sarah Breeden, the head of International Banks Supervisor at the Bank of England, has said that transition risk alone could constitute up to a $20 trillion loss to the financial system.258 Particular attention has been paid to the risks of a bubble in the coastal housing market, and relatedly, the municipal bond market.259 There have been attempts at predicting how the financial sector will react to climate-induced economic losses.260 One recent paper models how climate change induced reduction in labor productivity and capital stock could impact the stability of the global banking system.261 In the model, climate impacts increase the frequency of firm bankruptcies and unpaid loans, requiring banks to be bailed out by governments, as overall macroeconomic growth slows due to warming.262 Under such a scenario, this banking instability can lead to financial crises amounting to 30% of GDP.263 256 Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Eng., Chair of the Fin.

Climate change poses a risk to factors of production, and to growth itself (labor, for example, becomes less productive in hotter temperatures). It therefore constitutes a macroeconomic risk that may or may not be labeled “systemic,” depending on whether that term can be applied to the real economy. Further, contagion can exist in the real economy—think of the supply chain effects of a major port being wiped out (or even the 1970s oil crisis).264 Climate risks therefore certainly constitute a systematic risk (as in broadly affecting the economy and non-diversifiable), even if one remains skeptical of the prospects of financial contagion.265 IV. RECOMMENDATIONS A wide range of proposals have begun to appear for encouraging market actors to include climate in their assessment of financial risks, including integrating climate risks into prudential regulation and stability monitoring,266 amending fiduciary duties of CEOs and asset managers,267 and integrating climate risks into central bank asset purchases.268 The CFTC’s 2020 report on Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System alone lists 53 distinct recommendations for regulators to take; A comprehensive discussion of recommendations is therefore beyond the scope of this Article.269 One particular intervention, a mandatory https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3703142&download=yes) (arguing that banks do not hold sufficient amounts of carbon intensive credit assets for physical or transition risks to threaten their solvency in times of stress) 264 Thanks to Onur Özgöde for discussion on this point.

No amount of disclosure, however, can protect the market from climate change. The only path toward financial stability requires halting emissions. Beyond the “market failure” of emissions externalities, there is a limit to what increased disclosure can facilitate in the face of unhedgeable systemic risks. A. UPDATE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS As discussed elsewhere, the SEC already has the statutory authority to enact a mandatory climate risk disclosure regime.272 Issuing climate risk disclosure regulations falls within the SEC’s self-defined “core mission to promote investor protection, market efficiency and competition, and capital formation.”273 270 Simon Jessep & Matthew Green, BlackRock CEO backs mandatory climate reporting, urges U.S. action, REUTERS (Nov. 10, 2020), https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-climate-change-blackrock- idUKKBN27Q2TS; See Press Release, Allison Herren Lee supra note XX; Lee Mindy S.

The SEC must develop the expertise to evaluate whether climate-related claims about the future are misleading, a task that will require a substantial investment in hiring and collaboration with climate experts. Any mandatory climate risk disclosure regime has to meet climate science where it is. Regulators must pay particular attention to the spatial and temporal scales of requested disclosures, and ensure they are both scientifically feasible, and tailored to industry-specific needs.278 In particular, an overemphasis on false precision provided by complicated models might obscure the usefulness of other methods of risk assessment and 2016)); see also Zohar Goshen & Gideon Parchomovsky, The Essential Role of Securities Regulation, 55 DUKE L.J. 711, 715 (2006) (asserting that the essential role of “securities regulation is . . . to facilitate and protect the work of inform[ed] traders” that leads to the production of more information about firms’ values). 274 J.D.

See Fiedler et al., supra note X at 90. 50Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble communication.279 This fact should inform how the SEC decides to structure climate risk disclosure compliance, including balancing the pros and cons of principles-based versus line-item disclosures.280 In crafting disclosure regulation, the SEC should draw on climate-related expertise at other federal agencies through interagency working groups and advisory boards.281 1. Dealing With Uncertainty Issuers opposed to heightened climate risk disclosure requirements have sometimes argued that the large amounts of uncertainty around climate change makes forward-looking disclosures impossible, or misleading.282 And climate 279 Id.; Financial regulators are correct in calling for “future research… to go further and develop models and measures of [climate-related risks] that can be applied to individual assets.” Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva, Deputy Gen.

Climate risk data firms like Four Twenty Seven—bought by Moody’s in 2019—specialize in this type of short-term physical risk assessment.

There may be a need for a government role in fostering this project, which will require “substantial new investment in high performance computing, climate model design and a long-term investment in climate science capability.” Fiedler et al. supra note X. 280 SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee dissented from the SEC’s recent update to regulation S- K, arguing that the SEC’s “broad, principles-based ‘materiality’ standard” was failing to produce the “consistent, reliable, and comparable” information that investors want, especially with regard to climate risks. Press Release from Allison Herren Lee, SEC Comm’r, “Modernizing” Regulation S- K: Ignoring the Elephant in the Room (available at https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee- mda-2020-01-30). It’s true that the broad principles based standard gives managers too much discretion to withhold information. See section X supra. However some consideration must be made to whether specific, quantitative line-item disclosures are appropriate for certain forms of climate risk. This determination must be made in consultation with climate scientists and accounting experts. In some cases, quantitative disclosures may mask uncertainty, and may require contextual information like assumptions made, or error bars in order to better inform investors. 281 See e.g., EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB), YOSEMITE.EPA.GOV, https://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabpeople.nsf/WebCommittees/BOARD (last visited Feb. 15, 2021) (In 1978, upon congressional direction, the EPA established the EPA Science Advisory Board to “advise the agency on broad scientific matters” as well as review scientific information used for agency programs and regulations); Condon et al, supra note X, at X; The IWG on the SCC is presently… 282 Peabody Energy Settlement; Greg Baer, BankThink: Climate Risk Test asks Banks to Look Too Far Down the Road, AMERICAN BANKER (Nov. 30, 2020), https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/climate-risk-test-asks-banks-to-look-too-far-down-the- road. 51Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble scientists themselves have warned that reliance on global climate models for pricing short-term business risk can be misguided.283 Central bank authorities, too have cautioned that due to complexity and non-linearity, potential unknown tipping points, and fat-tailed risks, macroeconomic models of long-term climate impacts cannot necessarily be relied upon to target policy goals.284 However, as engineers focused on adaptation have warned, regulators should avoid the conflation of “deep uncertainty as to the distant future with potentially predictable, uncertainty as to the near future.”285 One means of facilitating disclosure in the face of longer-term uncertainty is through scenario analysis, which delivers information about risk exposures in different future possible states of the world, without assigning probability to those futures. 286 This method helps to deliver information to investors without glossing over the high degree of uncertainty when estimating energy sector transitions, warming pathways, and climactic responses. The SEC should consider whether or not to construct and provide specific scenarios for companies to report against.287 When the choice of scenario is left up to issuer discretion, they may choose 283 Fiedler et al., supra note X at X. 284 THE GREEN SWAN, supra note X, at 3 (citing Martin L.

These scenarios predict an orderly transition away from fossil fuels, a “robust” demand for natural gas through 2040, and largely ignore potential short-term stressors.290 Universal reliance on one projection of future transition pathways could in fact amplify the harmful effects of a surprised market, rather than diminish them. Peloso encourages thinking of scenario analysis “as a tool for imagination” in which corporate resilience is strengthened through the consideration of a wide variety of scenarios: short-term, long-term, and those that include potential “double black swan” events. She warns that if you “reduce scenario analysis to a cookbook” you constrain the 288 Kate Mackenzie, The Trouble with Climate Change Scenarios is Everyone Has Their Own, BLOOMBERG (Aug. 7, 2020), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-07/the-trouble- with-climate-change-scenarios-is-everyone-has-their-own.

Press Release, N.Y. State Office of the Att’y Gen., supra note 93. The investigation found that in its projections of the future, Peabody frequently referred in public statements to results of only one of the [International Energy Agency] IEA’s three scenarios for worldwide coal demand: the ‘Current Policies Scenario,’ a status-quo scenario that predicts rising future demand for coal based on an assumption that governments will fail to adopt any new policies or regulations to reduce the amount of climate change pollution—even policies and regulations that the IEA deems governments are likely to adopt. In doing so, Peabody failed to disclose the IEA’s other two scenarios, which are much less favorable projections of world coal demand by the IEA. There are also complaints from investors that even when companies use the same scenarios they often report different types of information gleaned from the analysis, making it very hard to compare disclosures across companies.

Engaging with Auditors and PCAOB Securities regulators face a balancing challenge when designing disclosure regimes: how to give investors the information they need without either overwhelming them with data or revealing competitive trade secrets. Auditors play a key role in this balancing act. And while climate change can materially impact many of the disclosure metrics already required in official financial statements, the U.S. auditing industry is prey to many of the same myopic drivers discussed infra.292 Even those companies that voluntarily report under the TCFD framework, and include climate in management’s discussion of risk, fail to clarify whether their financial reporting considers these risks.293 The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to oversee the audits of public companies. PCAOB Board Member Robert Brown has argued that auditors are failing to include climate-related risks in their discussions of Critical Audit Matters (CAMs), meant to point out aspects of the audit that “involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex auditor judgment.”294 Because climate-related risks to companies are “highly dependent upon the particular assumptions used by management,” you might expect them to be discussed in CAMs covering the reasonableness of 291 Regulators should consider requiring that all underlying assumptions used to construct scenarios be disclosed, including metrics such as economic life of assets and the percentage of valuation that can be attributed to future growth.

CAMs provide a means for the auditor to speak directly to the investor, whereas the rest of the financial statement comes from management and rests on management’s assumptions. 54Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble assumptions related to asset lives or commodity prices, yet very few mention climate.295 The SEC should work together with the PCAOB to encourage auditor oversight and assurance of corporate climate risk reporting, including that the reporting is consistent with disclosed financial statements.296 The PCAOB should develop resources and guidance for assisting auditors in this role and using tools like scenario analysis. Through its oversight of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC should ensure that climate risk considerations are included in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).297 As the Financial Times recently argued, climate risks may be uncertain, “but so is the time value of money.”298 3. Provision of Climate-Risk Assessment Tools and Data Information asymmetries are typically thought of in corporate disclosure theory as one-way.299 But climate risk is a case in which the information breakdown happens in two directions. Investors do not have information on exactly where assets are, where the suppliers are based, what route supply chains travel over, what design specifications were used to build key infrastructure. A manager knows these facts better than shareholders, but doesn’t necessarily understand the predictive science of climate impacts any better. If behavioral biases and informational transaction costs are getting in the way of the average company and the average shareholder assessing their risk exposure, there is a role for regulators to lower these costs of information acquisition. At the minimum, there should be a website where you can plug in an address or coordinates and see what sea level rise will be under different levels of warming, or expected number of days over threshold 295 Id. 296 Samantha Ross, Role of Accounting and Assurance in Addressing Climate Risk, W.P.

Civil society has begun to fill this void, but the resources and authority of the federal government are sorely needed.300 The SEC’s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA) serves as the SEC’s “think tank,” and is tasked with integrating financial economics and data analytics “into the core mission of the SEC.”301 DERA’s Offices of Risk Assessments and Data Science facilitate enforcement by “developing customized, analytic tools and analyses to proactively detect market risks indicative of possible violations.”302 The SEC should build institutional competency within DERA and its offices, and work with other agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to provide climate-risk information and assessment tools to investors and the public.303 B. LIMITS OF DISCLOSURE While accurate disclosure of climate risks can help make individual companies and investors more prepared for the physical risks of climate change, and can smooth, and perhaps hasten, the transition to a net-zero economy, it alone cannot correct the most significant “market failure” of climate change externalities: unregulated emissions. As Bolton et al. point out: “climate-related risks will remain unhedgeable as long as system-wide transformations are not undertaken.”304 With supply chain risks, for example, the knowledge that your local port has a high risk of being wiped out by a hurricane has limited use when shipping alternatives do not 300 See CFTC Report, supra note X at 60 (“The challenge ahead will be to balance both the public and private objectives in the interests of both transparency and innovation.”); see also, U.S. GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM, OUR CHANGING PLANET: THE U.S. GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020, https://downloads.globalchange.gov/ocp/ocp2020/Our- Changing-Planet_FY-2020.pdf. 301 U.S. SECURITIES & EXCHANGE COMM’N, ABOUT THE DIVISION OF ECONOMIC AND RISK ANALYSIS, https://www.sec.gov/dera/Article/dera- about.html#:~:text=The%20Division%20of%20Economic%20and,making%2C%20enforcement% 2C%20and%20examination, (last visited Jan. 30, 2020).

The CFTC’s report on Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System acknowledges that disclosure alone cannot address “the heart of the matter,” unabated greenhouse gas emissions.306 Direct regulation of emissions is necessary.307 What the CFTC does not note, however, is that direct regulation is required to address physical risks and adaptation deficits as well, not just mitigation deficits. A wide range of market actors suffer from the myopic tendencies discussed in this Article. Governments have an urgent role to play in ensuring that credit rating agencies, zoning laws, professional organizations, building codes, and municipalities are considering and responding to climate risks. Australian insurance giant Suncorp for example, has argued for its government to impose “compulsory adoption” of climate change adaptation plans on corporations.308 It and AIG have both called for governments to invest resources in climate adaptation, including flood infrastructure, updated building codes, and longer-term climate adaptation planning.309 U.S. regulators should consider a program of infrastructure audits.310 Disclosure is further insufficient because individual steps taken to limit the risk exposure of certain assets may counter-productively contribute to overall risk in the system. This can happen in both the financial and real economies.311 305 See, e.g., Merritt B. Fox, Civil Liability and Mandatory Disclosure, 109 COLUM. L. REV. 237, 253 (2009) (“Issuer disclosure may reduce risk—on average bringing price closer, on one side or the other, to actual value—but it reduces only unsystematic risk.”). 306 CFTC Report, supra note X at xix. 307 The CFTC Report’s first recommendation to regulators is listing “establish a price on carbon.” Id. at 9.

The “levee effect” describes how flood protection infrastructure can encourage more people to locate in a risky area, increasing the damage that occurs when the infrastructure fails.312 Relatedly, Zac Taylor has argued that Florida’s booming insurance-linked securitization market “defers risk management responsibilities to external capital providers, and by extension deepens the long-term exposure” of the state economy to climate risk.313 The ability to purchase annual insurance today may encourage development in areas better left unbuilt. An alternative model, Taylor argues, should emphasize “risk reduction over risk transfer.”314 Climate adaptation requires planning at the national level, including plans for managed retreat.315 C. SHAREHOLDERS As discussed supra, firm directors and managers are typically compensated via stock or stock options in order to incentivize maximization of the share price. However, as argued by Lynn Stout: “If market prices do not closely reflect actual expected risks and returns, [a] single-minded focus on share price is a recipe for mismanagement.”316 Shareholders, as monitors of corporate management, should examine the metrics by which executive compensation is determined and push for the removal of those that distort managers away from long-term stewardship.317 Investors are increasingly advocating for the integration of climate-related metrics in executive remuneration.318 According to a 2020 PWC survey, 34% of directors individual institutions hedge against specific climate-related risks, but they can also amplify systemic risk” (citing (NGFS (2019b, p 14))). 312 See, e.g., Graham A.

Increasing board competency on climate change may also help to oversee that management is investigating and disclosing relevant risks.320 Large institutional shareholders should have a particular interest in how climate constitutes a systematic risk to portfolios, as these unhedgeable risks cannot be diversified away.321 These institutions have already been advocating for increased disclosure of climate risks. While they may not rely on the information to make trades, they should integrate climate risks into their governance oversight of portfolio companies. This may include taking a portfolio perspective, and seeking direct mitigation of climate risk itself through pressuring companies to reduce their emissions.322 V. CONCLUSION After the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission directed the (mostly corporate) operators of America’s 60 nuclear power plants to assess their exposure to flood risk.323 Of these, the Commission found that 54 of the plants were not designed to handle their current flood risks, including 19 whose designs could not withstand possible present-day storm surges.324 The assessment did not extend to consider future climate risks. The rest of corporate America lacks an industry-focused regulator to mandate hazard assessment, and yet is similarly exposed to the risks of obsolete designs colliding with a changed natural world. 319 Paula Loop et al., How Does the Board Oversee ESG?, HARV.

I write to submit the attached article, Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble, forthcoming Fall 2021 in the Utah Law Review. In the Article, I argue that markets are not accurately assessing climate change-related risks for an array reasons, many of which would be partially addressed by a mandatory climate disclosure regime. In particular, shareholders and analysts currently lack the fine-grained asset level data they need in order to make climate-risk assessments. Where corporate operations are located, the origins and routes of their supply chains, the sources and quantities of inputs like water and energy –– this is the type of information needed to assess climate risk exposure but is not the type of information currently disclosed in financial reports. Often, the information that is voluntarily disclosed aggregates data at too high a level, is given at widely varying time-scales that make comparison difficult, and fail to differentiate well between exposure and liability. Further, market actors continue to rely on risk assessment methodologies that are outdated in a climate-changed world. They may employ strategies that expose them to model risk, such as relying on unrepresentative historical records to project future exposure. And traditional means of risk assessment may ignore latent risks: The entire capital stock of corporate America was built using engineering specifications designed to endure certain temperature and weather extremes that may be regularly exceeded under a climate-changed world. A facility that was built to withstand a “100-year flood” may now have a much higher likelihood of failure. Additionally, corporate managers may continue to rely on outdated methods of risk assessment that suffer from a duration mismatch. Insurance premiums are reassessed annually, and so could spike suddenly to reflect",
        "unaccounted-for climate risk; yet they are nevertheless relied upon as a proxy for the cost of risk for investments with expected returns over many years. Any mandatory climate risk disclosure regime has to meet climate science where it is. Regulators must pay particular attention to the spatial and temporal scales of requested disclosures, and ensure they are both scientifically feasible, and tailored to industry-specific needs. An overemphasis on false precision provided by complicated models might obscure the usefulness of other methods of risk assessment and communication. In crafting disclosure regulation, the SEC should seek out climate-related expertise through interagency working groups, advisory boards, and staff hiring. Finally, I wish to highlight that while investors continue to shift their money into funds with an “environmental, social, and governance” (ESG) focus, perhaps suggesting an awareness of climate risks, there is insufficient scrutiny of index providers and their climate-related methodologies.

        "MARKET MYOPIA’S CLIMATE BUBBLE Madison Condon* A growing number of financial institutions, ranging from BlackRock to the Bank of England, have warned that markets may not be accurately incorporating climate change-related risks into asset prices. This Article seeks to explain how this mispricing can exist at the level of individual assets, drawing from scholarship on corporate governance and the mechanisms of market (in)efficiency. Market actors: 1. Lack the fine-grained asset-level data they need in order to assess risk exposure; 2. Continue to rely on outdated means of assessing risk; 3. Have misaligned incentives resulting in climate-specific agency costs; 4. Have myopic biases exacerbated by climate change misinformation; and 5. Are impeded by captured regulators distorting the market. Further, trends in institutional share ownership reinforce apathy toward assessment of firm-specific fundamentals, especially over long-term horizons. This underpricing of corporate climate risk contributes to the negative effects of climate change itself, as the mispricing of risk in the present leads to a misallocation of investment capital, hindering adaptation and subsidizing future fossil combustion. These risks could accumulate to the macroeconomic scale, generating a systemic risk to the financial system. While a broad array of government interventions are necessary to mitigate climate-related financial risks, this Article focuses on proposals for corporate governance and securities regulation—and their limits. Signals from the Biden Administration suggest that mandatory climate risk disclosure regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission is forthcoming. This Article argues that climate risk disclosure is necessary, though alone not sufficient, to address the widespread disregard of corporate climate exposure. * Associate Professor, Boston University School of Law.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble I. INTRODUCTION In 2016, a duo of computer scientists undertook the laborious task of creating a map of U.S. Internet infrastructure, indicating where cable was laid and where colocation centers were based.1 Because the whereabouts of this privately-owned infrastructure is kept secret by telecommunication companies, the researchers spent years scraping the web for scattered publicly available information about infrastructure location.2 When one of the researchers showed the results of his work to his wife, a climate scientist, she immediately remarked that much of the infrastructure was located in coastal regions at risk to be inundated by sea-level rise as soon as the coming decade. All three scientists then worked together, publishing a study showing that thousands of miles of fiber optic cable, and more than a thousand nodes of key Internet infrastructure, could be underwater in the next 15 years.3 The researchers also identified which providers had the most infrastructure at risk, concluding that AT&T and CenturyLink were the most exposed to the risks of sea-level rise.4 Any investors in these two companies paying attention to the 2018 study were likely surprised by its findings: neither of these companies’ recent 10K filings, meant to disclose potential risks to investors, had made any mention of sea-level rise.5 Their voluntary reporting of climate risks to the nonprofit CDP similarly omitted any mention of flood risk.6 * * * A growing number of financial experts at institutions ranging from BlackRock, to McKinsey, to the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, have reached 1 Alejandra Borunda, The Internet Is Drowning, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC (July 16, 2018). 2 Id. 3 Ramakrishnan Durairajan, Carol Barford & Paul Barford, Lights Out: Climate Change Risk to Internet Infrastructure, ANRW ‘18: PROCEEDINGS OF THE APPLIED NETWORKING RESEARCH WORKSHOP 9 (2018). 4 Id. 5 CenturyLink, Inc., Annual Report (Form 10-K) (Feb. 22, 2019), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892619000006/ctl2018123110k.htm; AT&T, Inc., Annual Report (Form 10-K) (Feb. 20, 2019), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000732717/000119312519045608/d705958d10k.htm. 6 CenturyLink’s 2017 voluntary disclosure of climate risks to the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”), the company made no mention of sea level rise.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble the conclusion that markets are not accurately assessing and pricing climate change- related risks. In April 2019, a coalition of 42 central banks recognized that “there is a strong risk that climate-related financial risks are not fully reflected in asset valuations.”7 Christine Lagarde recently warned that central bankers “will have to ask themselves” if they are “taking excessive risk by simply trusting mechanisms that have not priced in the massive risk that is out there.”8 According to one survey, 93% of institutional investors agree with her that climate risk “has yet to be priced in by all the key financial markets globally.”9 Yet while the consensus (and evidence)10 grows that assets are mispriced, there has been less attention paid to diagnosing why that might be; what are these faulty “mechanisms” that Lagarde says are not to be trusted?11 This Article seeks to explain how this mispricing can exist at the level of individual assets, disputing academic claims that climate risks are “already reflected in market price[s].”12 Contrary to recent arguments in the corporate law literature, there is in fact ample reason to believe that equity analysts “are systematically less able to assess the valuation impacts” of climate risks.13 First, shareholders and analysts currently lack the fine-grained asset-level data they need in order to make climate-risk assessments.14 Where corporate operations 7 NETWORK FOR GREENING THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, A CALL FOR ACTION: CLIMATE CHANGE AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL RISK 4 (Apr. 2019) [hereinafter NGFS, CALL FOR ACTION]. 8 Carolynn Look, Lagarde Says ECB Needs to Question Market Neutrality on Climate, BLOOMBERG (Oct. 14, 2020), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-14/lagarde-says-ecb-needs-to- question-market-neutrality-on-climate. 9 Climate Change and Artificial Intelligence Seen as Risks to Investment Asset Allocation, Finds New Report by BNY Mellon Investment, BLOOMBERG, (Sept. 16, 2019), https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-09-16/climate-change-and-artificial-intelligence- seen-as-risks-to-investment-asset-allocation-finds-new-report-by-bny-mellon-investm. 10 See infra section II.A. 11 With the noted exception of Jakob Thomä & Hughes Chenet, Transition Risks and Market Failure: A Theoretical Discourse on Why Financial Models and Economic Agents may Misprice Risk Related to the Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy, 7 J.

When “value-relevant” information about a company is withheld from the market, that information cannot be reflected in share price, and so prices diverge from “fundamental efficiency,” or the “correct” price, meaning the discounted present value of expected cash flows from holding the stock. The assertion that stock prices reflect all publicly available information is the “semi-strong” version of the Efficient Capital Markets Hypothesis (ECMH) (the strong version of the ECMH, that prices reflect all information, even information kept internal to the firm, has been widely accepted as untrue). As the following reasons show, this Article argues that with respect to climate risks, markets are both fundamentally inefficient (not reflecting true underlying value) and informationally inefficient (not reflecting information that is already 4",
        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble are located, the origins and routes of their supply chains, the sources and quantities of inputs like water and energy –– this is the type of information needed to assess climate risk exposure but is not the type of information currently disclosed in financial reports.15 Often, the information that is voluntarily disclosed aggregates data at too high a level, is given at widely varying time-scales that make comparison difficult, and fail to differentiate well between exposure and liability.16 Second, market actors continue to rely on risk-assessment methodologies that are outdated in a climate-changed world.17 They may employ strategies that expose them to model risk, such as relying on unrepresentative historical records to project future exposure. And traditional means of risk assessment may ignore latent risks: The entire capital stock of corporate America was built using engineering specifications designed to endure certain temperature and weather extremes that may be regularly exceeded under a climate-changed world. A facility that was built to withstand a “100-year flood” may now have a much higher likelihood of failure. Additionally, corporate managers may continue to rely on outdated methods of risk assessment which may suffer from a duration mismatch. Insurance premiums, for example, can no longer be relied upon to serve as a proxy for the cost of physical risk on a contemplated project; returns are calculated over many years, but premiums can change annually to reflect previously unpriced risk. Third, corporate managers, with an eye toward maintaining a high share price, have little incentive to discover and disclose information that might reveal their company’s stock price is overvalued.18 Equity-based compensation and firm- specific executive remuneration metrics may encourage managers to focus on the publicly known, or knowable with presently available data and analytical tools).

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble disclosure and preventing investors from integrating climate risks into their market decisions.26 No amount of regulatory or corporate governance intervention can give shareholders and managers the ability to foresee the future – the outcomes of national elections, for example, are both largely uncertain and hugely influential in determining the strength of future climate policy. However, there are actions within the power of both market actors and government regulators that can help to counter the unfolding market failure that is the continued neglect of assessing companies’ exposure to foreseeable climate risks. Net global sea-level rise over the next 15 years, for example, can be predicted with some certainty, and yet market actors nevertheless seem to disregard these projections when making asset-allocation decisions.27 The widespread underassessment of climate risk may lead to two undesirable economy-wide harms: 1) systemic risk to the financial system and 2) the physical damages stemming from climate change itself, as mispriced equity leads to mis- allocation of investment resources.28 If investors fail to demand risk assessment from companies, managers may be left unpunished by the market when they build homes and hotels in hurricane prone regions too close to the shore, or build bridges to withstand a “100-year-flood” based on a grossly unrepresentative historical record. This mis-investment imposes costs not just on the company and the investor, but on the communities harmed by collapsing bridges and hotel evacuees. Addressing climate-risk neglect will require an array of actions, from regulators and investors alike. Growing calls for mandatory climate risk disclosure, trends in other countries, and signals from the Biden Administration, suggest a mandatory climate-risk disclosure regime may be forthcoming in the United States.29 This 26 Fair Access to Financial Services, 85 Fed.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble Article supports this agenda, and provides some high-level guidance on how to design regulation to address the drivers of climate risk mispricing. Any mandatory climate risk disclosure regime has to meet climate science where it is. Regulators must pay particular attention to the spatial and temporal scales of requested disclosures, and ensure they are both scientifically feasible, and tailored to industry- specific needs.30 In particular, an overemphasis on false precision provided by complicated models might obscure the usefulness of other methods of risk assessment and communication.31 This fact should inform how the SEC decides to structure climate risk disclosure compliance, including balancing the pros and cons of principles-based versus line-item disclosures.32 In crafting disclosure regulation, the SEC should seek out climate-related expertise through interagency working groups, advisory boards, and staff hiring.33 Further, the SEC should 1. Require methods for addressing uncertainty, including scenario analysis 2. Work with auditors and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and 3. Facilitate disclosure and market response through public provision of climate-risk analytical tools.34 No amount of disclosure, however, can protect the market from climate change. The only path toward financial stability requires halting emissions. The CFTC Subcommittee’s report on Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System acknowledges this and lists reducing emissions as its first recommendation.35 However, direct regulation is also required to address physical risks and adaptation deficits, not just mitigation deficits. Climate adaptation requires planning at the national level. Beyond the “market failure” of emissions externalities, there is a limit to what increased disclosure can facilitate in the face of systemic risks; climate risks remain unhedgeable even with increased information. The Article proceeds as follows. Part II collects evidence of climate mispricing, including empirical studies examining how well the market has priced the 1.1°C of warming that has already occurred and models of climate impacts on portfolios. It then enumerates six distinct drivers of asset mispricing in the climate context, and explains why neither arbitrage nor private ordering through requests for voluntary disclosures can correct these market failures. Part III argues that there is a societal 30 See e.g., Tanya Fielder et al., Business Risk and the Emergence of Climate Analytics, NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE (2021); Standards Overview, Sustainability Accounting Standards Bd. 31 See e.g., Fielder et al., supra note X. 32 See note X infra, discussing Allison Herren Lee, “Modernizing” Regulation S-K; Ignoring the Elephant in the Room SEC Public Statement (Jan. 30, 2020). 33 See MADISON CONDON, SARAH LADIN, JACK LIENKE, MICHAEL PANFIL, & ALEXANDER SONG, MANDATING DISCLOSURE OF CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL RISKS, INSTITUTE FOR POLICY INTEGRITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND (2021). 34 See section IV.A infra. 35 CFTC REPORT, supra note X at X. 8",

Part IV discusses recommendations for regulators and investors. Part V concludes. II. CLIMATE RISK AND EQUITY-MISVALUATION Climate risks facing the private sector are typically broken down into three categories: transition risk, physical risk, and liability risk.36 Transition risk comes from a failure to adapt in time to a changing, less carbon-intensive economy as governments begin to regulate emissions, and alternative energy falls in price. “Stranded assets” in the fossil fuel industry are the classic example of transition risk.37 Physical risks are the threats faced by all industries that come from the changing climate itself. They include the impact of sea-level rise on the real estate industry, decreased labor productivity from hotter days, reductions in agricultural output due to droughts or floods, and many others.38 Liability risks are the potential that the parties that contribute to, or profit from, carbon emissions, are required at some point in the future to compensate those harmed by climate impacts.39 36 These are the categories identified by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, see Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, International Climate Risk Conference for Supervisors, De Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam: A Transition in Thinking and Action (Apr. 6, 2018). 37 Christopher McGlade & Paul Ekins, The Geographical Distribution of Fossil Fuels Unused When Limiting Global Warming to 2°C, 517 NATURE 187 (2015) (estimating that in order to keep warming below 2°C, “approximately 35% of current oil reserves, 50% of gas reserves, and nearly 90% of coal reserves are unusable”); Mark Lewis et al., Energy Transition and Climate Change: Stranded Assets, Fossilised Revenues, KEPLER CHEUVREUX 16 (2014) (calculating that if greenhouse gas are kept below 450ppm of CO2 equivalent in the atmosphere, the fossil fuel industry will lose $28 trillion in projected revenue through 2035, with the oil industry experiencing a 22% total decline in revenues); EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD, TOO LATE, TOO SUDDEN: TRANSITION TO A LOW- CARBON ECONOMY AND SYSTEMIC RISK, ESRB ASC REPORT No. 6 (Feb. 2016); Thomas Lee, Fossil Fuel Stranded Assets: Efficient Market or Carbon Bubble?, PENN WHARTON PUB.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble Many leaders in the financial sector have voiced their concern that industry’s current assessment of these risks is woefully inadequate. Hank Paulson, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and CEO of Goldman Sachs, wrote in a McKinsey newsletter in 2015: “As someone who has spent a good deal of time assessing risk and dealing with crises, I’m struck by the similarities between the climate crisis and the financial crisis of 2008.”40 The world’s largest asset management company, BlackRock, agreed: Many equity investors ignore climate risk, and credit investors and ratings agencies do not routinely assess it. Real estate markets often ignore extreme weather risk, even in highly exposed coastal areas. Most asset owners do not measure their exposure to potentially stranded assets such as high-cost fossil fuel reserves that may have to be written off if their use is impaired by climate change regulation. Who can blame them? There is little evidence that assets more susceptible to climate change and related regulatory risks trade at a discount to the market.41 In the six years since these statements were made, each of these actors—equity analysts, ratings agencies, asset owners, and corporate managers—have made slow progress toward integrating climate change into analyses of financial risks.42 Evaluating climate risk involves forecasting macroeconomic energy demand, guessing on the success of carbon regulation and future technologies, modeling the relationship between atmospheric gas concentrations and global temperatures, predicting how temperature rise will change the earth’s climate systems, and calculating how those changes impact physical economic assets.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble models that have only begun to be built. Each step of estimation adds layers of uncertainty to risk projections. In some cases, particularly those longer-term and macroeconomic, the estimation of the economic impact of climate change may be dwarfed by this uncertainty.43 However, this Article focuses on climate risks at the scale of individual corporations and investors and their horizons. It argues that the market is neglecting to respond to foreseeable risks. A. EVIDENCE OF MISVALUATION Evidence that the market is currently under-assessing climate risks comes in several forms. There are recent attempts by large institutional market actors to model the impact of carbon regulation and climate damages onto a representative market portfolio. There are also a handful of empirical studies examining how well the market has priced the climate-related impacts we have already been experiencing. Added to these relatively scarce forward-looking and backward- looking studies, are abundant anecdotal examples of market actors failing to prepare for climate impacts. In April 2019, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock released its investigation into the pricing of physical climate risks in three different categories of investments: municipal bonds, commercial real estate, and equities of electric utilities.44 The research was conducted alongside the climate-risk consultant Rhodium Group, and concluded that for each investment type, the market was failing to price asset exposure to the predictable increase in severe weather events and rising seas.45 In the case of municipal bonds, the report pointed out, for example, that declines in crop yields from increased temperatures, could be expected to depress the GDP of many metropolitan areas by multiple percentage points.46 Given cumulative damage impacts, BlackRock predicts that “within a decade, more than 15% of the current S&P National Municipal Bond Index (by market value) would be issued by [metropolitan areas] suffering likely average annualized economics losses of up to 0.5% to 1% of GDP.”47 Nevertheless, when these climate-sensitive bonds are compared to bonds issued by less climate- 43 THE GREEN SWAN, supra note X, at 3; Martin L.

In a 2°C scenario, which models a world with aggressive regulation of emissions that reaches net zero emissions by 2070, certain sectors suffer a severe decline in returns in the short term.53 Assets in the oil and gas industry, for example, lose 42.1% of their value by 2030.54 In the 3°C and 4°C scenarios, all sectors other than renewables have negative return impacts to both 2030 and 2050, with annual losses varying from 0.1% to 7.7%.55 Substantial warming has already occurred—around 1.1°C as compared to preindustrial levels.56 The earth’s planetary systems have reacted to this warming in manifest and measurable ways, making the economic impacts of climate change a matter of the present, not just the distant future.

One recent study of publicly traded food companies in 31 countries found that the market did not efficiently incorporate drought trend impacts on profits into stock prices, and estimated the mispricing to be as much as 7%.57 Another looked at the growing frequency of extreme temperature events from 1995 to 2017, and found that high temperatures reduce revenues and operating incomes of individual firms.58 Further, the greater the heat exposure, the greater equity analysts’ estimates deviate from actual financial performance.59 The authors conclude from their findings that “investors do not anticipate the repercussions of heat as a first-order physical climate risk.”60 The climate data firm 427 generates physical climate risk scores for individual firms based on their exposure to operational disruption risk.61 A recent paper shows that a trading strategy employing 427’s heat stress factor over the period from 2008-2018 – by selling high risk firms and buying low risk firms – would have generated returns of 77%.62 57 Harrison G.

And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s governing regulations prohibit them from factoring natural disaster risk into their pricing of mortgages bought from banks.67 Investors can only price the risks that they are aware of, and increasing attention has been paid to the lack of climate-related risk disclosure, leaving investors in the dark.

One recent study found that the total value of aggregated financial risk reported through both voluntary and mandatory corporate disclosures amounted to mere tens of billions of dollars of potential negative impact—at least two orders of magnitude smaller than top-down projections of costs to financial assets.69 According to the UN Finance Initiative public corporations can expect to face about $3 trillion in climate-related losses in the next 15 years alone.70 One recent example of this under-assessed and undisclosed climate risk comes from the California wildfires. In 2018, Pacific Gas and Electric voluntarily disclosed its climate-related risks to the nonprofit CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project).71 The company highlighted climate change driven increases in wildfire risk as a potential liability, and estimated its 2017 claim payouts at $2.5 billion.72 Any investor that relied on this information to be a fair predictor of future liability would be deeply disappointed in January 2019 when PG&E announced it was filing for bankruptcy and facing $30 billion in wildfire liabilities.73 PG&E’s share price fell more than 80% in two months.74 Expected damages from the changing climate extend far more broadly across the economy than mainstream financial news coverage might suggest to the average investor.

DRIVERS OF MISPRICING An array of financial regulators share the conclusion that financial markets are failing to price climate risks, and this conclusion is supported by the growing number of empirical and model-based studies discussed in the preceding section. Yet, as critics of “sustainability” investing point out, this conclusion appears at odds with the Efficient Capital Markets Hypothesis (ECMH), which suggests that all known, or knowable, financial risks are already priced into the market.78 This next section outlines the drivers of this mispricing, breaking them into six discrete categories: (1) Lack of asset-level data; (2) Model risk and latent risk; (3) Misaligned incentives of corporate leadership; (4) Myopic shareholders and market structure; (5) Misinformation and biases; and (6) Political opposition and regulatory capture. This Article argues that in some cases the market is mispricing risks that are already known, or could be known with present research methods and publicly available data. In other cases, the data need is unavailable to the market and kept internal to the corporation. 1.

Have the operators of the asset made investments in climate adaption already? Is the asset relatively invulnerable?86 More resilient than industry peers?

Outdated Means of Risk Assessment: Model Risk, Latent Risk, and Duration Mismatch The traditional methods by which market actors assess risk may be particularly prone to failure in a climate-changed world. Financial models, including those impacting capital-allocation decisions within corporations, often rely on historical data to make future projections of risk.89 In the climate context, the future will look very different from the past in myriad ways. Historical data representing a relatively stable climate past cannot be relied upon to predict future risks.90 Future expected risk has to be creatively modeled – a challenge given uncertainties regarding emissions levels, future regulation, changes to the earth’s systems, and socioeconomic feedbacks.91 The failure to adjust risk assessment methods for corporate decisions like crop selection, or the location and resilience of infrastructure, is one example of model risk.92 88 Sarah Whateley, Jeffrey Walker & Casey Brown, A Web-Based Screening Model for Climate Risk to Water Supply Systems in the Northeastern United States, 73 ENV.

Firm managers make decisions about how to allocate their companies’ capital to future investment projects by evaluating the expected future returns of these projects. To do this, they must account for how risky the project is, but current mainstream financial methods of evaluating this risk are not well-adapted to a future of climate extremes. The most common method used for assessing a potential investment is to calculate its net present value by summing all expected future returns over the lifetime of the project and discounting them by the risk-free rate (which represents the time-value of money) and a risk-premium, meant to account for riskiness of the project. This risk premium is rarely assessed by forward looking asset- specific analysis of risk, and instead is typically captured by backward-looking measures of past risk, often assessed at the company (rather than asset) level. See Mohsen Taheri, Mehdi Irannajad 18",
        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble Another type of model risk associated with climate change is failure to capture extreme unprecedented events. For example, one standard measure that portfolio managers use to estimate potential losses is value at risk (VaR). VaR provides a level of confidence, such as 95 or 99%, that an expected loss will fall within a certain range. But VaR says nothing about the potential magnitude of loss for the extreme event that has a 1% chance of occurring. Given that certain climate risks are highly uncertain, and potentially catastrophic, they may lie in this 1% zone that is likely to be discounted by market actors as “unlikely.”93 This “fat-tail risk” deviates from the normal distribution that market actors may be accustomed to rely on in their models.94 A further potential for model risk comes from misjudging not only the increased frequency and severity of extreme climate events, but also their correlation.95 Large multinationals, like PepsiCo, have operations located around the globe and their size may factor into their traditional approach to risk management: it has been historically unlikely that a hurricane will hit operations in Brazil, Florida, and India & Majid Ataee-Pour, Risk-adjusted Discount Rate Estimation for Evaluating Mining Projects, 4 FINSIA J. APPLIED FIN. 36, 36 (2009) (describing CAPM as the “main method” for estimating the risk adjusted discount rate for mining projects). For example, one common method of approximating the appropriate risk premium is to calculate the cost of capital of similar firms in the same industry relative to the market. This calculation is often done using long term averages of the firms’ stock prices. Kahan, Securities Laws, supra note X at X. In a world of climate change, however, past risk is no longer representative of future expected risk.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble 3. Misaligned Managerial Incentives Corporate managers have access to their firms’ operational data, and are likely better positioned, as compared to their shareholders, to assess their firms’ resilience to climate change. However, they may lack personal incentives for seeking out and assessing climate risk, let alone disclosing potential risk exposures to the market.109 The revelation that a firm is exposed to previously unaccounted-for climate risks may lead to a fall in share price that managers are trained, and incentivized, to avoid.110 In some cases, adapting to climate change requires up-front capital expenditures in order to stave off longer-term losses—like the raising or relocation of facilities. But managers that manage to a stock-price set by a myopic market are discouraged from making these investments in the short term.111 The reasons why managers may focus on keeping stock price high in the short term, even if that means sacrificing longer-term fundamental value, have been well explored in the literature. A drop in stock price may open up a manager to the risk of being fired,112 so in the interest of self-preservation she may focus on the demands of myopic shareholders while neglecting to spend resources assessing and mitigating longer term risks to the company.113 Further, executive remuneration is regularly linked with short-term metrics of firm performance, including through compensation in stock, or stock options.114 Evidence suggests that the shorter the time CEOs have to wait before their options vest, the more likely they are to cut investment budgets, personally profiting from the market’s interpretation of short- 109 See, e.g., Armour, Gordon & Min, supra note X at 26-31 (arguing that stock-based, including options-based, executive compensation models incentivize corporate managers to neglect risk management programs, to the detriment of the long-term value of the stock); see also Anat R.

In 2016, the New York attorney general announced it had reached a settlement with Peabody after an investigation revealed the many ways the company had withheld information from investors regarding internal projections for future coal demand.120 While Peabody’s “disclosures denied its ability to reasonably predict the future impact of any climate change regulation on its business… the company and its consultants [internally] projected severe impacts from certain potential regulations that would materially affect Peabody.”121 In another example of potential managerial manipulation, an Exxon whistleblower 115 Tomislav Ladika & Zacharias Sautner, Managerial Short-termism and Investment: Evidence from Accelerated Option Vesting, (U. of Amsterdam, Working Paper 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2286789; Alex Edmans, Vivian W.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble claims the company deceptively overvalued one of its largest oil assets, and forced- out employees who objected to the figure as unrealistic.122 Equity-overvaluation can drive managers to preference short-term performance metrics over long term value-creation in an effort to meet market expectations.123 Michael Jensen has argued that in order to live up to the expectations of an over- valued stock price, managers spend money on schemes that destroy long run value but “mask the inherent uncertainty in their businesses.”124 In his model, executives sometimes spend money on investments that are not net-present-value justified, just to keep up the appearance of growth and the promise of future profits.125 This “overvaluation trap,” it has been argued, describes the decisions of oil executives to spend hundreds of billions of dollars, each year, on prospecting for new reserves, despite there being a 53 year supply of oil contained in the world’s existing 2 trillion barrels of reserves.126 Oil companies derive most of their net present value from the future promised profitability of their reserves.127 Any acknowledgement on the part of executives that these reserves may, in fact, not be worth bringing to the surface in a future world with stricter climate regulation and more competition from renewables, will lead to a decline in stock price. (In 2004, under pressure from regulators, Shell downwardly adjusted its estimated proven reserves by 20%, and share prices fell 10%).128 The practice of fossil fuel companies continuing to predict future cash flows from reserves that will likely be left undeveloped in an emissions- regulated world, is consistent with these practices.129 122 Christopher Matthews & Emily Glazer, Exxon Draws SEC Prove Over Permian Basin Asset Valuation, WALL ST.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble Some industries have adapted their compensation structures to counteract the general underinvestment pressure of short-termism, but these metrics may incentivize the wrong kind of long-term goals, reinforcing mispricing. In the fossil fuel industry, for example, many companies have policies that tie executive bonuses to the “reserves replacement ratio,” meaning the amount of reserves added relative to the amount extracted that year.130 This metric, along with the common practice of linking incentives to exploration and production, rather than revenue is meant to encourage investment in capital projects that may not generate revenues for many years.131 At ExxonMobil, for example, 23% of executive pay is tied to metrics that directly incentivize growth in reserves and production, and another 23% is tied to “indirect growth” metrics like earnings and cash flow.132 But these metrics are now out of synch in a world where long-term capital would best be served by not adding to likely unprofitable reserves. 4.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble in the capital markets that suggest investors are following a different methodology than what we traditionally think an investor does, i.e. learning about a company to predict future profits and trading on that information. The corporate governance literature contains a voluminous debate about whether short-term focused hedge funds pressure corporations to be myopic, and if so, whether their longer-term counterparts, institutional investors like asset managers and pension funds, serve as a counter-acting force to this short-termism.134 But this debate has largely failed to grapple with another difference (besides horizon) between long-term institutional investors and short-term focused hedge funds and quant traders: the former are increasingly quasi-indexers who “passively” buy and hold baskets of assets, while the latter make frequent firm-specific trades. Even if institutional investors are able to promote long-termism through governance measures and oversight of management, it is still active investors trading on the margins that determines share price. While roughly 80% of the net present value of a long term investor’s portfolio is based on cash flows expected beyond the five year horizon, most equity analysts make buy or sell recommendations employing risk analyses that fall within the three to five year mark.135 Some of the sectors that are likely to be the most exposed to long-term climate risks, like utilities and real estate, have the largest percentage of their net present values derived from expected cash flows that extend more than 20 years into the future.136 One recent survey asked equity analysts why there was such a focus on the short term, despite the fact that most equity is now held by “long term” investors.137 The analysts reported that disconnect was due, in part, to lack of demand from investors.138 Weak investor demand for long term risk analysis may be explained, in part, by the rise in short-term trading.139 In 1960, the average share of stock was held for 134 Compare Lucian A.

The decision to buy or sell becomes increasingly divorced from an analysis of a stock’s underlying fundamentals, and based more upon “heterogeneous expectations about price movements.”143 Former Delaware Supreme Court Chief Justice Leo Strine has commented that “actively traded funds turn over at a rate which makes it difficult to believe that their managers are basing their decisions on a genuine assessment of the corporations’ long-term cash flow prospects as opposed to their speculation about where the market is heading.”144 It has been empirically shown that increases in stock ownership by shorter-horizon investors is associated with reductions in longer-term investment spending and increased short-term earnings.145 These cuts to spending, like reductions in research and development, (Eur.

From the perspective of the hedge fund, it makes sense to force a company to sell assets that the market undervalues in the short term. But with carbon regulation increasingly inevitable, the sale may end up damaging NRG’s long-term prospects. The lack of demand for long term risk analysis may be exacerbated by the rise of passive investment strategies, like indexing and exchange traded funds (ETFs).150 At present, around half of US stock held in investment funds are 146 Id.

Indexing has grown rapidly over the years, with hundreds of millions of dollars exiting active funds and entering passive funds.153 As consumer demand for actively managed funds declines, so does the budget for equity research.154 The number of equity analysts employed by investment funds has steadily declined in recent years,155 with the 12 largest investment banks employing 25% fewer analysts in 2019 as compared to 2011.156 One report quoted an analyst as saying their “biggest and fastest growing client base is the hedge fund industry, which pushes analysts to be short-term.”157 Index funds, unlike the buyers and sellers in an active market, are constrained by their investment strategy. They cannot sell out of a stock they believe is grossly overvalued. One index fund manager, in explaining his worry that the market misprices climate risk, acknowledges that his firm’s indexing strategy prevents the use of exit, which would otherwise drive down the price of an overinflated stock: empirical study that “the preference shift towards index fund investing is reducing the informational efficiency of stock prices”). 151 John Detrixhe, Half of US stock fund assets are now invested in index funds, QUARTZ (May 20, 2019), https://qz.com/1623418/index-funds-now-account-for-half-the-us-stock-market/. 152 See John H.

One way might be to simply calculate and then publicly release information on climate-risk mispricing in the hope that the market responds. One of the first (and still best) studies of physical risk mispricing was produced by asset manager BlackRock.160 Some corporate observers caution that short-term trading based on market volatility, rather than fundamental financial analysis, will lead to “herding effects,” in which individual investors make under-informed trades based on market responses to limited information, such as earnings reports.161 This follow-the-leader game of stock valuation leads to distortions away from efficient pricing. Index investing, is in some sense, the ultimate herd.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble Concerns that the rapid rise of indexing will lead to inefficient markets are typically dismissed with the explanation that the remaining active funds will engage in trading that will result in the accurate pricing of equity.163 However, these active funds typically have a shorter holding period and investment horizon than index funds, and are interested in short-term, rather long-term profits.164 BlackRock responds to allegations that its ETFs distort efficient stock pricing by pointing out that there is an “extremely diverse” set of indexes: ones with “a broad market focus, others with a geographic focus, and still others with a sector-specific focus.”165 The company argues that their investor-customers make the decision as to which index best suits their needs. The implication is that this asset allocation decision itself affects price efficiency, as it reflects investor demand. A counter response to this defense is that price efficiency is about individual stocks, not baskets of stocks. Or, if we take BlackRock’s argument that index selection is just another form of active management—impacting price efficiency—then perhaps index providers should be regulated as financial advisors.166 Further, the increasing flow of money into ESG investment products ($20 billion in 2019 only)167 suggests that investors are in fact waking up to climate- related risks and potential mispricing. But the main vehicle for ESG investing tends to be these “passive” funds that track an ESG index whose composition has been determined by companies’ ESG scores.

As Adriana Robertson has argued, the investor is, in a way, delegating asset allocation decisions to the creator of the ESG index.169 This delegation may come with underexplored agency costs and third-party mediation that obscures price efficiency. Vanguard’s ESG US Stock ETF was called out by the Financial Times for including companies like Kinder Morgan and Marathon Petroleum, despite claiming to “specifically exclude” fossil fuels.170 One analysis of funds offered in the UK found that more than one-third of those marketed as climate or low-carbon focused nevertheless contained oil and gas stocks.171 5.

Why? Because we have had a 30-year, well-funded program to make the problem of climate change seem vague, distant, and problematic. . . . How many [climate] deniers does it take to distort the price?

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble Over the last few decades, fossil-fuel companies, related industries, and their allies, have gone to great lengths to spread misinformation and doubt about the existence and impacts of climate change.174 The Trump administration aided in this disinformation campaign. Federal agency websites have been overhauled to remove the term “climate change,” deleting whole documents and webpages on the issue.175 The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said in a 2017 CNBC interview that he does not believe carbon dioxide to be a “primary contributor” to global warming.176 These efforts have had a well-documented influence on public opinion.177 While an increasing percentage of the population now agrees that climate change is occurring—primarily because of their direct observations of extreme weather— understanding of its causes and effects are poor. In a 2018 survey in Germany, only 31% of respondents correctly answered “no” to the question of whether ocean evaporation due to higher temperatures was predicted to lead to declines in global sea-level.178 Fifty-one percent thought that the ozone hole is the main cause of the greenhouse effect.179 A recent survey asked 439 institutional investors about their assessment of climate related risks.180 Forty percent of the respondents indicated that they expected more than 2°C of warming by the end of the century, and just 12% expected an increase of more than 3°C. This means 60% of institutional investors believe warming will stay below 2°C despite the evidence that even if all countries were to fully meet their emissions targets and pledges under the Paris Agreement, 174 ORESKES & CONWAY, supra note X; MEYER, supra note X.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble Even when market actors have access to valid information concerning climate risks, their risk-assessment judgment is still tempered by persistent cognitive biases. Climate change, a long-term process not easily discernable in our daily lives, poses a challenge to accurate human threat assessment for a number of reasons. Psychological research has demonstrated that humans suffer from a status quo bias, whereby we not only prefer current conditions but also irrationally assume they will continue.188 This bias may influence shareholders to undervalue the significance of climate risk.189 The rational assessment of climate risk is further muddled by the very nature of information about climate change. Behavioral psychology tells us that information is complicated and “difficult to decipher” is more likely to be discarded as untrue.190 Market actors suffer from a number of heuristics, or mental shortcuts, which can derail the rational processing of complicated information. First, the availability heuristic may cause people to excessively discount the possibility of “black swan” climate events unless they’ve recently encountered salient examples of such events.191 But, by definition, these high-impact low-probability events are unlikely to occur frequently. Investors and managers, failing to find examples of these events in their everyday lives, may irrationally devalue serious climate risks to their companies and portfolios.192 Rational decision making is also stymied by a myopic focus on immediate rewards irrespective of the long-term consequences of those rewards.193 Market actors are predisposed to prefer short term goal gratification regardless of its long 188 See William Samuelson & Richard Zeckhauser, Status Quo Bias in Decision Making, J.

Individuals are influenced by the availability heuristic – the tendency to give greater importance to events that happened recently, or that are easier to recall.196 For this reason, market actors are most likely to imagine a future that looks similar to the recent past, even if it means ignoring broader scientific understanding.197 Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky’s Prospect Theory suggests that company executives may be reluctant to spend upfront capital on climate adaptation measures, even if those measures save the company money in the long run. Under Prospect Theory’s certainty effect, individuals put more weight on outcomes that are certain, and less weight on outcomes that are unlikely, discounting them by more than the rational weighting of their probability of occurrence.198 Thus, managers may overweight the costs of adaptation measures in the present, which have a certain, known, price tag, and underweight expected future climate damages whose magnitude and timing is more uncertain. Managers may be subject to cognitive biases that encourage them to withhold share value-decreasing information. Donald Langevoort argues that, even in the absence of intentional misrepresentation, managers “may subconsciously perceive information in a way, if at all possible, that permits them to maintain consistency with their self-image of efficacy and control, thereby justifying (to themselves and others) preservation of their positions and status.”199 In the face of great uncertainty around the future of carbon regulation, managers may disregard future scenarios for decreased oil demand that are well within the realm of 194 Walter Mischel & Ebbe Ebbesen, Attention in Delay of Gratification, 16 J.

Corporate Opposition / Regulatory Capture Shareholders concerned about climate risk have begun to press for disclosure directly from companies themselves. Their efforts, however, face opposition from corporate management, not only directly, but also through industry influence on government regulators.204 200 In 2016, a small group of Exxon shareholders expressed concern that the company was “eroding shareholder value” through investments in capital projects that would be unprofitable in “a low carbon demand scenario.” They noted that Exxon’s capital expenditures had grown “9 percent from 2005 to 2014, coinciding with a 1 percent net income decline” and that Exxon had cut capital distributions to shareholders (through both dividends and buybacks) by 25 percent in the preceding year. Similarly concerned shareholders of Chevron pointed to a Chatham House report that concluded “the only realistic option” for oil majors is to provide cash to shareholders and “shrink into the remaining areas of operation…where they can earn an acceptable return.” The report noted that this action “would require a major change in [firms’] corporate culture.” 201 Christopher M.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble In response to growing shareholder support for climate disclosure resolutions, the National Association for Manufacturers (NAM) funded the formation of the Main Street Investors Coalition, a group that advocates against the influence of institutional shareholders and their focus on ESG issues. Many fossil fuel executives, including those of Exxon and Shell, sit on NAM’s board of directors.205 The Coalition’s executive director has argued that shareholder climate risk disclosure resolutions are motivated by asset managers’ personal “political objectives” rather than genuine concern for assessing investment risk.206 SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce has similarly spoken out against shareholder advocacy for heightened environmental disclosures, arguing they are motivated by “public shaming” rather than interest in informed investing.207 The Coalition was a vocal supporter of several Trump-era regulations that have the net effect of making it harder for investors to reflect climate risk in their asset allocation decisions. Under Trump, the SEC finalized two rules that limit investor power to press for climate risk disclosure from companies: one that limits the ability of investors to propose and re-propose shareholder resolutions;208 and another that increases issuer power relative to proxy advisory firms that counsel institutional investors on shareholder votes.209 In addition, the Department of Labor amended regulations under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act to require that retirement plan fiduciaries exclusively consider “financial factors” relevant to the Virginia Harper Ho, Disclosure Overload?

MARKET FAILURE While a growing number of investors argue that climate risks remain mispriced, they cannot correct the mispricing on their own. Informed investors are limited in their ability to arbitrage away mispricings, particularly those that are widespread, and for which the timing of market correction is difficult to predict.213 And while investors have made some progress in getting corporations to disclose climate- related risks under voluntary frameworks, these frameworks are insufficient as they provide broad discretion to issuers and little assurance as to accuracy of the information provided. 1. Inability of Market to Self-Correct If there is in fact systemic and irrational investor bias, the ECMH posits that rationally informed arbitrageurs will exploit the mispricing, reaping a profit while bringing prices back to fundamental values.214 However, practical limits to arbitrage in the real world means that the knowledge that asset valuations ignore climate risks does not necessarily enable an investor to make a profitable trade on that information, particularly without knowledge of when these risks will be exposed and repriced. 210 29 C.F.R. pts. 2509, 2550 (2020); Press Release, Ceres, Ignoring overwhelming opposition, Labor Department adopts new rule that will impair ESG investing (Oct. 30, 2020).

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is the most widely used model for calculating the equilibrium price of stocks. It assumes that all investors have access to the same publicly available information and that all investors have homogeneous expectations about future valuations. In the real market, however, investors have access to different amounts of information and may form different forecasts about the future.215 When shareholders hold increasingly heterogenous expectations about the future, “one would expect increasingly inefficient prices, at least as judged by the yardstick of the CAPM.”216 Bill Bratton and Michael Wachter have explained that heterogeneity in shareholder expectations is more likely to occur in situations when shareholders face uncertainty in predicting the future, such as “when there is a change in technology, when glamour companies emerge, or when companies running newer businesses with less established track records become an important part of the market.”217 Climate change presents a similar shift in the status quo that impedes reliable forecasting. Even if some group of shareholders are informed, the speculative aspect of stock price fluctuations might lead them to hold on to their stock rather than sell, knowing that climate skeptics and backward-facing algorithms are going to maintain demand in the immediate future. A well-informed investor may suspect, or even know, that a stock is overvalued and deviating from the true value diminished by climate risk, but she may nevertheless be powerless to influence the trends of the market.218 Why aren’t savvy investors shorting stocks misvalued due to climate risk? And shouldn’t this shorting mechanism itself move prices closer to fundamental value? Some investors are in fact banking on the mispricing. David Burt, profiled in Michael Lewis’s book The Big Short, is known for having predicted the 2008 subprime crisis and helping Cornwall Capital make millions of dollars through shorting the market.219 He has recently appeared in headlines again, this time for heading an investment firm whose strategy is betting against residential mortgage- 215 Gilson & Kraakman, Mechanisms of Market Efficiency supra note X at 577. 216 Id. at 561-62 n. 41, (citing Stephen Figlewski, Information Diversity and Market Behavior, 37 J.

Moral Hazard Even if markets—that is, managers of financial institutions—could correct the mispricing, their own motivation to do so may be muted by expectations of government bailout. As argued by Graham Steele, banks and other institutions may fail to price in climate-related tail-risks for precisely this reason: that in the event of catastrophic loss, they expect the government to provide funds rather than letting 220 Kate Duguid, Citing Climate Risk, Investors Bet Against Mortgage Market, REUTERS (Sept. 29, 2019) (He tells prospective clients “The market’s failure to integrate climate science with investment analysis has created a mispricing phenomenon that is possibly larger than the mortgage credit bubble of the mid-2000s.”); Diana Quick, Former Subprime Player Claims He Can Now Short the Mortgage Market for Climate and Covid Risks, CNBC (Nov. 23, 2020). 221 See, e.g., Jeff Schwartz, Fairness, Utility, and Market Risk, 89 OR.

Failures of Voluntary Disclosure Standards Shareholders, especially institutional investors, have woken up to the likely mispricing of climate risk in recent years.229 And they have begun to demand the information they need for risk assessment via voluntary disclosures, through open letters to CEOs and votes in favor of disclosure proxy proposals.230 The private sector has come to something of a consensus around the default standard for a voluntary disclosure regime: the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosure (TCFD) produced a reporting framework in 2017 that is meant to be “widely adoptable” and “applicable to organizations across all sectors and jurisdictions.”231 The framework recommends eleven categories of disclosure, organized under four core elements covering governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and 225 Graham Steele, Confronting the ‘Climate Lehman Moment’: The Case for Macroprudential Climate Regulation, 30 CORNELL J.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble targets.232 Some investors and experts have pushed for companies to report against industry-specific standards in addition to their TCFD disclosures.233 Voluntary reporting frameworks, however, are an imperfect solution to the problem of inadequate climate risk disclosures. Without enforcement and standardization, companies can pick and choose which reporting frameworks, or categories of risk within those frameworks, they disclose. This is particularly evident in the voluntary disclosure of fossil fuel companies to CDP, who report “more opportunities than risks from climate change.”234 As of 2018, the average voluntarily complying company provided less than 4 of the 11 disclosure metrics recommended under the TCFD.235 Firms have been particularly slow to employ scenario analysis and discuss climate-related operational risk—just 9% discussed the resilience of their business models to climate change.236 And disclosures are far more likely to dwell on transition risks than discuss physical risks.237 These voluntary disclosures remain nonstandardized, and are difficult for stakeholders to analyze and compare across companies.238 A large number of companies simply do not report climate risks through voluntary frameworks or otherwise. One third of S&P 500 companies do not disclose their own (Scope 1) emissions, a relatively uncomplicated metric.239 Further, voluntary climate reporting is subject to a lower level of scrutiny than mandatory financial disclosure, which may impact the quality of the information provided. Among the S&P 500 companies, most sustainability and environmental disclosures lack external assurance and the vast majority of external assurance is done on only a fraction of the information provided.240 As a result of the lack of third-party audits, investors are hesitant to rely on current climate disclosure packaged in “sustainability” reports.

SOCIETAL HARM OF CLIMATE RISK UNDERASSESSMENT Two types of harms are generated by the under-assessment of climate risk: (1) systemic risk to the financial system; and (2) the negative effects of climate change itself, as the mispricing of climate risk in the present leads to an inefficient allocation of investment capital. If investors fail to demand risk assessment from companies, managers may be left unpunished by the market when they build homes and hotels in hurricane prone regions too close to the shore, or build bridges to withstand a “100-year-flood” based on a grossly unrepresentative historical record. This misinvestment imposes costs not just on the company and the investor but on the communities harmed by collapsing bridges and hotel evacuees. A. CLIMATE DAMAGE If the stock market fails to respond to poor managerial decisions like building in flood plains or mis-forecasting supply chain disruptions, capital will be allocated inefficiently.242 This is harmful not just to investors, but to everyone who relies on the goods and services these companies provide as well as those harmed by the externalities they generate. Disclosure of risk enhances “efficiency by improving corporate decisions relating to which proposed new investment projects in the economy are selected for implementation and how already existing projects are operated.”243 The majority of new public company investment comes from internally generated capital rather than funds raised from investors through financial instruments.244 Shareholders monitor the allocation of this capital through corporate governance mechanisms—oversight of managers and directors—rather than project-specific evaluation, and many of these mechanisms rely on share price as a proxy of success. As argued by Kevin Haeberle, inaccurate stock prices thwart 241 242 Zohar Goshen & Gideon Parchomovsky, The Essential Role of Securities Regulation, 55 DUKE L. J. 711, 720 (2006) (“Accurate pricing is essential for achieving efficient allocation of resources in the economy.”); cf. Lynn A. Stout, The Unimportance of Being Efficient: An Economic Analysis of Stock Market Pricing and Securities Regulation, 87 MICHIGAN L. REV. 613, 642-44 (1988) (arguing that “efficient stock markets may be neither necessary nor sufficient for the proper allocation of capital among corporations” partly because most capital is raised outside of the equity markets). 243 Merritt B.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble shareholders from monitoring management and the use of corporate funds, and reduce “the efficiency with which society allocates its scarce capital.”245 For example, oil and gas companies are currently allocating large up-front capital to the exploration and development of extractive projects that many argue are not net present value justified given projections of future demand in a carbon regulated world.246 Were carbon risks to be accurately priced, it is likely that many of these projects would not be greenlit. One recent report calculates that between 40% and 50% of ExxonMobil’s upstream capital expenditure through 2025 will be spent on developing fossil resources that will be unsellable in a world that effectively implements regulation to limit warming to 2°C.247 Nevertheless, once these projects have been brought online, the expense of development will be a sunk cost. Oil and gas companies may decide to continue to process and sell fossil fuels at slightly above cost in order to recoup some, but not all, of the money spent, rather than abandoning the project entirely. For this reason, the mispricing of carbon risk in the present inefficiently subsidizes the future production of fossil fuels.248 Similarly, managers unpunished by the market have little incentive to invest in adaptation measures, and may neglect to spend money on elevating their factory, or investing in alternative energy sources, or researching heat resistant crops.249 Poor capital-allocation decisions made today will have long-lasting effects, 245 Id. 246 Martin & Kemper, supra note x. 247 CARBON TRACKER INITIATIVE, 2 DEGREES OF SEPARATION: TRANSITION RISK FOR OIL AND GAS IN A LOW CARBON WORLD 24 (2017) (predicting that Exxon is the most exposed of the world's oil and gas firms to wasted capital expenditure if the atmospheric CO concentration is kept below 450 2 ppm). 248 See Andrea Liesen, Climate Change and Financial Market Efficiency, 54 BUS. & SOCIETY 511, 531 (2015) (explaining, “In the state of inefficiency evidenced in this research, the stock market does not correctly incorporate the climate-change-induced systematic risk of European companies when allocating ownership of capital stock.

SYSTEMIC RISK One harm that stems from the failure to assess climate risk is the systemic nature of the risk itself.251 The primary way that academics and regulators have discussed the systemic nature of climate risk is through its possibility to cause a contagion of financial failures.252 If certain industry stocks are indeed overvalued due to the financial sector’s failure to account for climate risk, the market may gradually adjust the mispricing in a slow price decline as it incorporates new information. Or, the market may correct suddenly, resulting in chain-reaction effects throughout the financial world. The more asset prices diverge from fundamentals, the higher the likelihood of a large and sudden realignment, a.k.a., a bubble burst.253 A recently published “climate stress test of the financial system” calculated that 6 percent of the average investment fund’s equity holdings are in the fossil fuel industry, while an additional 36 percent are in “climate-policy relevant” sectors, including utilities, mining, housing, and transport.254 If each of these industries has failed to assess and disclose their exposure to climate risk, this amounts to a great deal of unaccounted risk that accumulates at the portfolio-level.255 250 JAMES WILLIAMS ET AL., SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS NETWORK, POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF DEEP DECARBONIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES 54 (2015). 251 See KERN ALEXANDER, RAHUL DHUMALE & JOHN EATWELL, GLOBAL GOVERNANCE OF FINANCIAL SYSTEMS: THE INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF SYSTEMATIC RISK 24 (Oxford Univ.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble This systemic risk literature, however, is limited by its focus on the financial sector and contagion. Climate change poses a risk to factors of production, and to growth itself (labor, for example, becomes less productive in hotter temperatures). It therefore constitutes a macroeconomic risk that may or may not be labeled “systemic,” depending on whether that term can be applied to the real economy. Further, contagion can exist in the real economy—think of the supply chain effects of a major port being wiped out (or even the 1970s oil crisis).264 Climate risks therefore certainly constitute a systematic risk (as in broadly affecting the economy and non-diversifiable), even if one remains skeptical of the prospects of financial contagion.265 IV. RECOMMENDATIONS A wide range of proposals have begun to appear for encouraging market actors to include climate in their assessment of financial risks, including integrating climate risks into prudential regulation and stability monitoring,266 amending fiduciary duties of CEOs and asset managers,267 and integrating climate risks into central bank asset purchases.268 The CFTC’s 2020 report on Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System alone lists 53 distinct recommendations for regulators to take; A comprehensive discussion of recommendations is therefore beyond the scope of this Article.269 One particular intervention, a mandatory https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3703142&download=yes) (arguing that banks do not hold sufficient amounts of carbon intensive credit assets for physical or transition risks to threaten their solvency in times of stress) 264 Thanks to Onur Özgöde for discussion on this point.

        "Market Myopia’s Climate Bubble Systematic integration of climate risks by financial actors can help prepare corporations and the broader economy for both the green transition and physical resilience.274 A mandatory disclosure regime can help overcome both managerial and investor biases.275 The famous adage “you can’t manage what you don’t measure” holds here: the very process of collecting information and assessing resilience may help managers respond to previous under-priced and unaddressed risks.276 Disclosure may also facilitate the construction and monitoring of ESG metrics and indices designed to reduce exposure to climate risk.277 However, even under a mandatory disclosure regime, corporate managers maintain their share-price based incentives to potentially obscure future risks. The SEC must develop the expertise to evaluate whether climate-related claims about the future are misleading, a task that will require a substantial investment in hiring and collaboration with climate experts. Any mandatory climate risk disclosure regime has to meet climate science where it is.

It’s true that the broad principles based standard gives managers too much discretion to withhold information. See section X supra. However some consideration must be made to whether specific, quantitative line-item disclosures are appropriate for certain forms of climate risk. This determination must be made in consultation with climate scientists and accounting experts. In some cases, quantitative disclosures may mask uncertainty, and may require contextual information like assumptions made, or error bars in order to better inform investors. 281 See e.g., EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB), YOSEMITE.EPA.GOV, https://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabpeople.nsf/WebCommittees/BOARD (last visited Feb. 15, 2021) (In 1978, upon congressional direction, the EPA established the EPA Science Advisory Board to “advise the agency on broad scientific matters” as well as review scientific information used for agency programs and regulations); Condon et al, supra note X, at X; The IWG on the SCC is presently… 282 Peabody Energy Settlement; Greg Baer, BankThink: Climate Risk Test asks Banks to Look Too Far Down the Road, AMERICAN BANKER (Nov. 30, 2020), https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/climate-risk-test-asks-banks-to-look-too-far-down-the- road. 51",

These scenarios predict an orderly transition away from fossil fuels, a “robust” demand for natural gas through 2040, and largely ignore potential short-term stressors.290 Universal reliance on one projection of future transition pathways could in fact amplify the harmful effects of a surprised market, rather than diminish them. Peloso encourages thinking of scenario analysis “as a tool for imagination” in which corporate resilience is strengthened through the consideration of a wide variety of scenarios: short-term, long-term, and those that include potential “double black swan” events.

Press Release, N.Y. State Office of the Att’y Gen., supra note 93. The investigation found that in its projections of the future, Peabody frequently referred in public statements to results of only one of the [International Energy Agency] IEA’s three scenarios for worldwide coal demand: the ‘Current Policies Scenario,’ a status-quo scenario that predicts rising future demand for coal based on an assumption that governments will fail to adopt any new policies or regulations to reduce the amount of climate change pollution—even policies and regulations that the IEA deems governments are likely to adopt. In doing so, Peabody failed to disclose the IEA’s other two scenarios, which are much less favorable projections of world coal demand by the IEA. There are also complaints from investors that even when companies use the same scenarios they often report different types of information gleaned from the analysis, making it very hard to compare disclosures across companies.

Engaging with Auditors and PCAOB Securities regulators face a balancing challenge when designing disclosure regimes: how to give investors the information they need without either overwhelming them with data or revealing competitive trade secrets. Auditors play a key role in this balancing act. And while climate change can materially impact many of the disclosure metrics already required in official financial statements, the U.S. auditing industry is prey to many of the same myopic drivers discussed infra.292 Even those companies that voluntarily report under the TCFD framework, and include climate in management’s discussion of risk, fail to clarify whether their financial reporting considers these risks.293 The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to oversee the audits of public companies. PCAOB Board Member Robert Brown has argued that auditors are failing to include climate-related risks in their discussions of Critical Audit Matters (CAMs), meant to point out aspects of the audit that “involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex auditor judgment.”294 Because climate-related risks to companies are “highly dependent upon the particular assumptions used by management,” you might expect them to be discussed in CAMs covering the reasonableness of 291 Regulators should consider requiring that all underlying assumptions used to construct scenarios be disclosed, including metrics such as economic life of assets and the percentage of valuation that can be attributed to future growth.

Through its oversight of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC should ensure that climate risk considerations are included in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).297 As the Financial Times recently argued, climate risks may be uncertain, “but so is the time value of money.”298 3. Provision of Climate-Risk Assessment Tools and Data Information asymmetries are typically thought of in corporate disclosure theory as one-way.299 But climate risk is a case in which the information breakdown happens in two directions. Investors do not have information on exactly where assets are, where the suppliers are based, what route supply chains travel over, what design specifications were used to build key infrastructure. A manager knows these facts better than shareholders, but doesn’t necessarily understand the predictive science of climate impacts any better. If behavioral biases and informational transaction costs are getting in the way of the average company and the average shareholder assessing their risk exposure, there is a role for regulators to lower these costs of information acquisition. At the minimum, there should be a website where you can plug in an address or coordinates and see what sea level rise will be under different levels of warming, or expected number of days over threshold 295 Id. 296 Samantha Ross, Role of Accounting and Assurance in Addressing Climate Risk, W.P.

LIMITS OF DISCLOSURE While accurate disclosure of climate risks can help make individual companies and investors more prepared for the physical risks of climate change, and can smooth, and perhaps hasten, the transition to a net-zero economy, it alone cannot correct the most significant “market failure” of climate change externalities: unregulated emissions.

The CFTC’s report on Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System acknowledges that disclosure alone cannot address “the heart of the matter,” unabated greenhouse gas emissions.306 Direct regulation of emissions is necessary.307 What the CFTC does not note, however, is that direct regulation is required to address physical risks and adaptation deficits as well, not just mitigation deficits. A wide range of market actors suffer from the myopic tendencies discussed in this Article. Governments have an urgent role to play in ensuring that credit rating agencies, zoning laws, professional organizations, building codes, and municipalities are considering and responding to climate risks. Australian insurance giant Suncorp for example, has argued for its government to impose “compulsory adoption” of climate change adaptation plans on corporations.308 It and AIG have both called for governments to invest resources in climate adaptation, including flood infrastructure, updated building codes, and longer-term climate adaptation planning.309 U.S. regulators should consider a program of infrastructure audits.310 Disclosure is further insufficient because individual steps taken to limit the risk exposure of certain assets may counter-productively contribute to overall risk in the system.

The “levee effect” describes how flood protection infrastructure can encourage more people to locate in a risky area, increasing the damage that occurs when the infrastructure fails.312 Relatedly, Zac Taylor has argued that Florida’s booming insurance-linked securitization market “defers risk management responsibilities to external capital providers, and by extension deepens the long-term exposure” of the state economy to climate risk.313 The ability to purchase annual insurance today may encourage development in areas better left unbuilt. An alternative model, Taylor argues, should emphasize “risk reduction over risk transfer.”314 Climate adaptation requires planning at the national level, including plans for managed retreat.315 C. SHAREHOLDERS As discussed supra, firm directors and managers are typically compensated via stock or stock options in order to incentivize maximization of the share price. However, as argued by Lynn Stout: “If market prices do not closely reflect actual expected risks and returns, [a] single-minded focus on share price is a recipe for mismanagement.”316 Shareholders, as monitors of corporate management, should examine the metrics by which executive compensation is determined and push for the removal of those that distort managers away from long-term stewardship.317 Investors are increasingly advocating for the integration of climate-related metrics in executive remuneration.318 According to a 2020 PWC survey, 34% of directors individual institutions hedge against specific climate-related risks, but they can also amplify systemic risk” (citing (NGFS (2019b, p 14))). 312 See, e.g., Graham A.

While they may not rely on the information to make trades, they should integrate climate risks into their governance oversight of portfolio companies. This may include taking a portfolio perspective, and seeking direct mitigation of climate risk itself through pressuring companies to reduce their emissions.322 V. CONCLUSION After the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission directed the (mostly corporate) operators of America’s 60 nuclear power plants to assess their exposure to flood risk.323 Of these, the Commission found that 54 of the plants were not designed to handle their current flood risks, including 19 whose designs could not withstand possible present-day storm surges.324 The assessment did not extend to consider future climate risks.
