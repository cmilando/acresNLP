Buildings in Boston can also be grouped by\u0003 age and density\u0003 . As noted before, Boston has some of the oldest housing stock\u0003 in a major city\u0003 in the US, with over 50% of Boston’s housing units built be- fore 1940 . Taller buildings, both residential and commercial, are much newer, in general . However, industrial properties also tend to be older and less well prepared, with many\u0003 industrial properties originally\u0003 built in the 1950’s .

Density\u0003 of Living Spaces in Boston Note that Downtown and parts of Charlestown show very low densities of residential space. (Data from the Boston Assessing Depart- ment.) While different building ty\u0003pes are distributed throughout the city\u0003, some neighborhoods are more dense in specific categories of buildings than others . Sometimes this neighborhood grouping is a result of building age and history\u0003, sometimes it is a result of zoning by\u0003 the city\u0003, and in many\u0003 cases, results from a confluence of forces . For example, comparing the Allston neighborhood with the Leather District/Chinatown neighbor- hood, the differences in both building ty\u0003pe and age across the city\u0003 are apparent . Figures 1 .11 and 1 .12 show comparisons of building ty\u0003pe and age of buildings in the two neighborhoods . Nearly\u0003 85% of buildings in Allston were built before 1950, and over 75% of buildings are residential . However, in the Leather District/Chinatown neighborhood over 20% of buildings are commercial in nature, and there are more newer buildings than in Allston .

Long-term erosion is a result of multi-year impacts such as repetitive flooding, wave action, sea level rise, sediment loss, subsidence, and climate change… Landslides occur when the slope or soil stability changes from stable to unstable, which may be caused by earthquakes, storms, vol- canic eruptions, erosion, fire, or additional human-induced activities. Potential impacts include environmental distur- bance, property and infrastructure damage, and injuries or fatalities. FEMA Mitigation Ideas P 15, P 37 Most of Boston is classified as a moderate landslide risk. Those parts of Boston furthest from the coast are classified as low risk.

In addition to public health problems, urban heat islands increase energy use and costs as well as pollution lev- els in cities, causing additional ill- ness. Adapting to Urban Heat, P 1 A high solar reflectance—or al- bedo—is the most important characteristic of a cool roof as it helps to reflect sunlight and heat away from a building, reducing roof temperatures. A high thermal emittance also plays a role, par- ticularly in climates that are warm and sunny. Together, these properties help roofs to absorb less heat and stay up to 50–60°F (28–33°C) cooler than conventional materials during peak summer weather. Building owners and roofing contractors have used cool roofing products for more than 20 years on commercial, industrial, and residential buildings. They may be installed on low- slope roofs (such as the flat or gently sloping roofs typically found on commercial, industrial, and office buildings) or the steep-sloped roofs used in many residences and retail buildings. EPA Cool Roofs Website Vegetated, or green roofs are a popular strategy to reduce Heat Island Effect in urban settings. The vegetation absords heat and uses it for evapotranspiration, reducing tem- perature rise associated with impermeable surfaces, like roofs.

Building Resiliency Task Force. 27 P 150. Well designed insulation systems reduce conduction through the thermal envelope. During the summer, this can reduce interior air temperature, peak electrical demand, and annual cooling require- ments. By controlling conductive gains and losses, the building also relies less on heating and cooling systems, further reducing cooling requirements and electrical demand.

Building Resiliency Task Force page BR-6 1 Passive ventilation strategies are equally important in residential and commercial properties of all scales, to help ensure continued usability of buildings during extended system outages. (Image: Marcus Springer) STRATEgIES • Use cross ventilation for passive cooling. Cross ventilation relies on the air pressure from the wind to remove heat from a space. Designing spaces o to allow for cross ventilation provides a passive method of cooling the building on warm days. In the event of a power failure, cross ventilation may allow the building to continue to be occupied even if there is no mechanical cooling present. Green Building and Climate Resilience p.1771 • Use stack ventilation for passive cooling. Designing spaces to allow hot air to rise up and out of the space provides a passive method to cool o the building on warm days. In the event of a power failure, stack ventilation may allow the building to continue to be occupied even if there is no mechanical cooling present. Green Building and Climate Resilience p.181 • Install ceiling fans. Electric fans increase indoor air speeds, helping to provide thermal comfort. When used in conjunction o with air conditioning, they can help to reduce energy use if the thermostat set point temperature is raised. This can reduce electrical energy demand and usage through the cooling season. Green Building and Climate Resilience p.185 • Consider thermal energy storage. Thermal energy storage can reduce energy demand during the daytime by producing chilled water at o night to reduce the load on mechanical systems and electrical grid. This approach can help a building to respond to increased temperatures by reducing peak daytime demand, allowing existing systems to respond greater demand for cooling without reconfiguration. Green Building and Climate Resilience p.187 • Insulate Water System. Insulating pipes helps to minimize heat loss and to protect cold water lines from freezing in the event of o extended loss of heating capability.

Secondary water sources can provide critical water supplies during emergencies or drought conditions. o FEMA Mitigation Ideas p.62 • Supply drinking water without power. During a power failure, residential buildings using electric pumps lose their supply of potable water. o Water may be present below the sixth floor, but in some cases remains unavailable if a non-operating pump blocks the water supply. Buildings need to designate one or more common areas on lower floors for potable water distribution. Building Resiliency Task Force P 132 • Ensure toilets & sinks work without power.

As of 2011, the program enrolled over one thousand local, county and tribal Citizen Corp Councils that represent 178 million citizens. Citizens Corps1 • As a neighborhood-level effort, San Francisco’s Neighborhood Empowerment Network (NEN) is leveraging every day concerns from citizens to create a routine of dialogue and community action. NEN’s Empowering Communities Program offers tool kits, university collaboration, and increased access to city government. Neighborhood Empowerment Network2 • Partner with existing clubs and ethnic communities to enhance resilience. • Social Aide and Pleasure Clubs (SAPCs) were instrumental in providing services for disadvantaged and excluded communities during Hurricane Katrina. SAPCs are associations of mostly lower to middle income African Americans who trace their heritage to cultural institutions created in response to racial discrimination and segregation. The SAPC Task Force worked to ease tensions among internal constituents and addressed external difficulties faced by their members including city relations and regulations and relations with the police. Rick Weil, P 143 • The New Orleans Vietnamese community and Mary Queen of Vietnam (MQVN) Catholic Church leveraged their high collective resources to return from evacuation, build new housing, and build workforce opportunities. Rick Weil, P 12 • Partner with existing coalitions and networks devoted to emergency response and community benefit. • In Gulfport Mississippi, Non-Governmental Organizations and Faith Based Organizations filled gaps in government response and recovery efforts, such as child care, pet care and transportation. Cities and Counties typically have Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) that don’t include these valuable stakeholders. Formed in 2007, the South Mississippi VOAD (Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster) provides a structured relationship among member organizations and has seats at state and county EOC meetings and committees Lessons from Gulfport, MS.4 • The East Cooper Community Outreach (ECCO) is a faith-based coalition formed to provide disaster recovery capacity for the Charleston Tri-County Area. Through partnerships with local governments, the ECCO member churches serve as places of refuge, distribution centers, and mobilize a force of trained volunteers in disaster scenarios. Their charge has grown and they operate year round to help alleviate situational and generational poverty.

Vernon Woodworth FAIA, LEED AP AKF Group, LLC The publication of the 2012 International green Construction Code (IgCC) marks a new direc- tion in the regulatory scope of building codes, focusing on sustainability rather than life-safety. The IgCC also offers a different format, with several compliance options, including the “ANSI/ ASHRAE/USGBC/IES Standard 189.1, Standard for the Design of High Performance, Green Build- ings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings”. The structure and much of the prescriptive content of the IgCC resembles LEED language translated into code format. A list of jurisdictional require- ments allows the code to be customized to local needs, and an appendix of “project electives” provides an additional level of flexibility at the discretion of the adopting jurisdiction. The IgCC was conceived and written as an overlay code, intended to be enforced in conjunc- tion with the other I-codes from the International Code Council: the IBC (International Building Code), the IRC (International Residential Code), the IPC (International Plumbing Code), and the IECC (International Energy Conservation Code). Its mandate is to establish a sustainable overlay on top of base code requirements. Therefore provisions for resiliency that do not address envi- ronmental sustainability, such as back-up power generation and sewage back-flow prevention, belong in the base codes rather than the IgCC. Although the term “resiliency” does not appear in the IgCC, many of the goals of this code will benefit the sustainability of the built environment in extreme weather events. Unlike any previous building code the IgCC contains provisions for site and land use that provide develop- ment buffers at wetlands and water bodies as well as mandatory storm water management requirements. These provisions can enhance absorption of storm surge and mitigate flooding. Permeable paving can also reduce run-off, which pollutes waterways and contributes to flood- ing. Provisions to reduce heat island effect will reduce cooling loads and facilitate survivability in heat waves. A project elective for vegetative roofs would contribute to the reduction of heat island effect and reduce storm water runoff. The heightened attention to issues of resiliency resulting from the devastation of Hurricane Sandy and several destructive tornados in the mid-west has stimulated discussion on the poten- tial role of building codes in disaster preparedness. Because the IgCC is scheduled to be updated every three years it is likely that a future edition will specifically address resiliency. However the overarching intent of the IgCC encompasses a larger scope: the overall impact of the built environment on ecosystems.

For cities like Boston, which was settled over 350 years ago, a critical aspect of resilience is adapting existing buildings to improve resilience to natural hazards, particularly in light of pending climate change impacts. The most common natural hazards in the Boston area are floods (including both rain events and coastal flooding with storm surge), severe storms (which include both rain and high wind conditions), and extreme temperatures (both hot and cold). A common secondary impact from extreme weather events is the loss of critical infrastructure services, including energy, water, wastewater, transportation, and communications. Climate change impacts are projected to exacerbate these extreme weather events, increasing both the frequency of the events as well as the magnitude of the impacts. As an example, sea level rise is expected to increase the incidence of coastal flooding, especially with storm surge, and the Photo: John Gravelin magnitude of the flooding will increase with the rising tides. More severe storms will, likewise, increase rain floods and ex- treme wind conditions, and increased ambient temperatures constructed post-WWII. Selected facilities may be vulnerable will likely increase the number of high heat degree days. to flooding (both in rain events as well as coastal flooding and storm surge) and all are extremely vulnerable to the loss Boston has the largest percentage of residential buildings of critical services. In addition, the healthcare facilities bear built before WWII across all major U.S. cities, and the majority the brunt of illnesses, injuries, and deaths during extreme of these buildings are wood-framed low-rise buildings (“tri- events, and must be operational even when other buildings ple-deckers”).

Additional attention may needed to identify View from Boston’s Prudential Center these informal centers and to explicitly incorporate the up- grade of these facilities with respect to their higher density of vulnerable persons. Improving the resilience of existing buildings for climate change impacts requires direct consideration of a multi- hazard approach with proactive development and imple- mentation of upgrades. As noted above, expected climate change impacts will increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme events in Boston throughout the seasons, and prudent planning will consider all relevant hazards for each location and building type. Many of the adaptation strategies for buildings identified in this study improve resilience for several hazards at once and also provide additional benefits during normal conditions. A recent study found that, for each dollar invested in mitiga- tion, over $4 of benefits are provided (MMC, 2006). For example, a strategy to add trees to a site to increase shading reduces stormwater flow, lowers ambient temperatures, and lessens wind impacts as well as improving air quality and Photo: John Gravelin quality of life.

(Cusick, 2013). While it is developing its disaster resilience plan, Boston can leverage current and emerging state and federal regulations to accelerate the upgrade of existing buildings to improve resilience. One such program is from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is developing regulatory ap- proaches for implementing the proposed National Storm- water Rule (WEF, 2013). Boston can potentially leverage the regulations to reduce stormwater flooding that threatens buildings.

The City of Chula Vista’s Climate Change Working Group recommends eleven strategies to adapt to climate change, includ- ing cool roofs, cool paving, and shade trees, as well as local water supply and re-use, stormwater re-use, extreme heat plans, open space management, wetlands preservation, codes for sea level rise and land development, “green economy”, and education for wildfires, and has developed detailed implementation plans. Clean Air Cool Planet (2011). Preparing for the Changing Climate: A Northeast-Focused Needs Assessment. Clean Air Cool Planet, Washington, DC. The study summarizes the results of survey of organizations across the Northeast U.S. on current and emerging climate change adaptation activities. It describes the activities by state, regional planning commissions and local governments. It concludes that these organizations need more technical assistance to vulnerability assessments, particularly for infrastruc- ture systems, as well as access to applicable climate change data and flood maps.

Adaptation Tool Hit: Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Land Use. Georgetown Climate Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC. (http://www.georgetownclimate.org/sites/default/files/Adaptation_Tool_Kit_SLR.pdf) The tool kit provides tools and examples of each tool applied for sea level rise planning. The report lists advantages and disadvantages of each tool: land use, setbacks/buffers, conditional development and exactions, rebuilding restrictions, sub- divisions and cluster development, permitting for property armoring, rolling coastal management/easement statues, capital improvements, acquisitions and buyout programs, conservation easements, tax and other development incentives, transfer- able development credits, and real estate disclosures. The report describes evaluation and governance criteria for each tool. The report also separates the strategies into four categories: protect, retreat, accommodate, and preserve. Hallegatte, S. et al. (2011). “Assessing Climate Change Impacts, Sea Level Rise and Storm Surge Risk in Port Cities: A Case Study on Copenhagen,” Climatic Change 104:113-137. The study calculates the economic cost of storm surges under different scenarios relative to insured assets, population den- sity, and industrial assets. It provides estimates for direct losses as well as losses associated with reduced economic activity, replacement costs, and resources required for reconstruction instead of normal activities. It then provides cost-benefit curves for adaptation efforts. Hansen, L. et al. (2013). The State of Adaptation in the United States: An Overview. Report for the John D. and Cath- erine T. MacArthus Foundation, New York City, NY. (http://www.georgetownclimate.org/sites/default/files/The%20 State%20of%20Adaptation%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf) This report analyzes the state of adaptation activities in the U.S., specifically focusing on agriculture, the built environment, human health, and natural resources management. The report generally concludes that there is a plethora of activities re- lated to climate change impacts assessment, and, to a somewhat lesser degree on vulnerability assessment, resources/tools, and planning, but there is a shortage of work in capacity building and implementation and essentially no activity in monitor- ing and evaluation of implemented projects.

(2010). “Comparing European Residential Building Stocks: Performance, Reno- vation, and Policy Opportunities.” Building Research & Information 37:5-6, 533-551. The study noted that across 8 countries, the barriers to sustainability upgrades were lack of knowledge and the unconvinc- ing cost-benefit relation where there is not a guaranteed return on investment for the upgrade. The policy overview shows that all countries studied have adapted their building regulations in recent years in order to promote energy efficiency. In principle, energy requirements for new buildings need to be met when dwellings are drastically renovated, e.g. in Germany and the Netherlands. The implementation of this principle varies from a requirement at the component level (e.g. insulation values) to performance agreements for buildings. In Germany, when more than 20% of a component (wall, roof or window) is changed, the dwelling needs to meet building regulations comparable with those for new construction. In Sweden, a component must meet the equivalent requirements for the newly built. In the UK, any work on existing buildings is expected to meet minimum energy-efficiency standards. For specified major improvements in buildings with floor areas exceeding 1000 m2, where there is a potential to increase energy intensity, for example, by extending a building or installing air-condi- tioning, there are further energy-efficiency requirements, taking into account the consideration that these requirements are technically, functionally and economically feasible.

In 1994, President William Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minor- ity Populations and Low-Income Populations,” directing federal agencies to address environmental injustices in their opera- tions and in communities across the country. Since, and in accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, states and municipalities have developed policies and programs to pro-actively address environmental equity concerns to help ensure that minority and low-income communities are not disproportionately impacted by environmental hazards.” Detailed Description Quotations: Building Resilience in Boston 106 July 2013“MassGIS Data - 2000 U.S. Census - Environmental Justice Populations.” Executive Office for Administration and Finance.

Any blockgroup with a minority population greater than 25% was selected as an EJ population. 2. Income The statewide median household income in 2000 (determined by the Dept. of Economic Development) was $46,947. 65% of this value is $30,515. Any blockgroup that had a median household income less than $30,515 is considered as an EJ popula- tion. 3. English Proficiency Linguistic isolation refers to a household in which no person 14 years old and over speaks only English and no person 14 years old and over who speaks a language other than English speaks English ‘‘Very well’’ is classified as ‘‘linguistically isolated.’’ In other words, a household in which all members 14 years old and over speak a non-English language and also speak Eng- lish less than ‘‘Very well’’ (have difficulty with English) is ‘‘linguistically isolated.’’ Figure 1.5: Boston Population Density Source: Linnean Solutions, Gravelin, John. “Population Density of Greater Boston” [map]. 1:200,000.

Berne, New York. 2006. <http://aswm.org/pdf_lib/14_map- ping_6_26_06.pdf> “What “parameters” are considered by wetland scientists in defining, mapping, and delineating wetlands? Wetland scientists and regulators use three principal types of wetland characteristics or “parameters” in defining, mapping, and delineating wetlands: • Vegetation. The types of plants that can live in wetlands are determined by the depth and duration of flooding and satura- tion. Vegetation is the most common paremeter used in defining, mapping, and delineating wetlands. There are over 7,000 plants which grow in wetlands in the U.S. A much smaller number, about 26%, are “obligate”. Obligate species grow only in wetlands and are strong indicators of wetland boundaries. “Facultative” plants grow in both wetlands and uplands and are a less good indicator but are useful when combined with soils and hydrologic information. • Evidence of hydrology. Hydrology (water depth, extent of inundation, period of inundation) determines all other wetland characteristics. However, hydrology is often not easily assessed. Often water can be observed at the surface only part of the year for many wetlands. Other evidence of hydrology (other than surface observation) may include flood records and flood maps, debris lines and evidence of flooding in trees and other vegetation, evidence of scour, and soils. Where there are uncertainties and disputes, field measurements of vegetation and soils may be taken over a growing season. Piezometers measuring water levels and hydrologic models may be used (although rare) to calculate the depth and frequency of inunda- tion and saturation and ground water levels. • Soils. Wetland soils often contain large amounts of organic matter because saturation prevents oxidation of plant materials. Soils reflect long term hydrology and are, therefore, useful in identifying wetlands even where hydrology and plants have been disturbed or during periods of drought.” Land Use Descriptions: (same land use source above) Brushland / Successional: Predominantly shrub cover, and some immature trees not large or dense enough to be classified as forest.

However categories 3 and 4 cause signifi- cant damage to parts of the city primarily because the elevation of the ocean would exceed that of the Charles River dam. Summary: The hurricane flooding layer was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hurricane Research Division Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory. The map chosen for the report represents the po- tential flood damage as provided by computer generated models that calculate the potential extent from different hurricane categories (Category 1,2,3 and 4). The highest category hurricane that has directly hit Boston in the past was a Category 3 Hurricane of 1869 (not named). The eye of this storm passed Boston ten miles inland and slowed to a Category 2 hurricane over New Hampshire and Maine. 29 different Hurricane and Tropical Storms and Depressions intersect a 50 miles radius of Boston.1 “Historical Hurricane Tracks.” National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Building Resilience in Boston 109 July 2013http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/F7.html Hurricane Categories defined directly as: “Maximum of MEOW (MOM) runs This is an ensemble product of maximum storm surge heights for all hurricanes of a given category regardless of forward speed, storm trajectory, landfall location, etc.. MOMs are created internally by pooling all the [Maximum Envelope of Water] MEOWs for a given basin, separated by category and tide level (zero/high), and selecting the MEOW with the greatest storm surge value for each basin grid cell regardless of the forward speed, storm trajectory, landfall location, etc. This procedure is done for each category of storm. Essentially, there is 1 MOM per storm category and tide level (zero/high). MOMs represent the worst case scenario for a given category of storm under “perfect” storm conditions. The MOMs provide useful information aiding in hurricane evacuation planning and are also used to develop the nation’s evaluation zones. The GIS models and values reflect the mean of the MOM results. ” Maximum Envelope of Water (MEOW) runs This is an ensemble product representing the maximum height of storm surge water in a given basin grid cell using hypo- thetical storms run with the same: Category (intensity) Foreward speed Storm trajectory Initial tide level Internally a number of parallel SLOSH runs with same intensity, forward speed, storm trajectory, and initial tide level are performed for the basin. The only difference in runs is that each is conducted at some distance to the left or right of the main track (typically at the center of the grid). Each component run computes a storm surge value for each grid cell. For example, five parallel runs may yield storm surge values of 4.1, 7.1, 5.3, 6.3, and 3.8 feet. In this case, the MEOW for the cell is 7.1 ft. It is unknown (to the user) which track generated the MEOW for a particular cell, so it is entirely possible that the MEOW values for adjacent cells may have come from different runs. MEOWs are used to incorporate the uncertainties associated with a given forecast and help eliminate the possibility that a critical storm track will be missed in which extreme storm surge val- ues are generated. MEOWs provide a worst case scenario for a particular category, forward speed, storm trajectory, and initial tide level incorpo- rating uncertainty in forecast landfall location. The results are typically generated from several thousand SLOSH runs for each basin. Over 80 MEOWs have been generated for some basins. This product provides useful information aiding in hurricane evacuation planning.

Silver Spring, Maryland. http://slosh. nws.noaa.gov/sloshPub/pubs/Vol-33-Nu1-Glahn.pdf Abstract: “The storm surge model, Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH), is used by the National Weather Service (NWS) in producing storm surge guidance in several ways. SLOSH is run by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to forecast storm surge in real-time when a hurricane is threatening. The model is applied to 38 specific coastal areas, called basins, along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the U.S.; Oahu, Hawaii; Puerto Rico; and the Virgin Islands. SLOSH is also used to create simulation studies to assist in the “hazards analysis” portion of hurricane evacuation planning by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and state and local emergency managers. Two composite products, Maximum Envelopes of Water (MEOW) and Maximum of the MEOWs (MOM), are created to provide manageable datasets for planning. The Probabilistic Storm Surge model (P-surge) overcomes the limitations of a single deterministic SLOSH storm surge forecast by being comprised of an ensemble of SLOSH forecasts. The members of the en- semble vary in speed, direction, intensity, and size, based on NHC’s forecast and past errors associated with NHC’s forecasts. P-surge is prompted to run when NHC issues a hurricane watch for the Atlantic or Gulf coasts. The Extratropical storm surge (ET surge) model uses SLOSH to forecast storm surge from extratropcial cyclones. The ET surge model uses surface wind and pressures that are generated by NWS’s Global Forecast System (GFS) model as driving forces.” Building Resilience in Boston 110 July 2013Figure 1.18: Wind and Hurricane Hazards for Boston Source: Wind Map: Linnean Solutions, Gravelin, John. “Estimated Wind Speeds of Greater Boston” [map]. 1:200,000.

Notable exceptions occur along the Texas coast and Cape Cod in Massachusetts where the coastal wind resource extends inland a considerable distance.” http://rredc.nrel.gov/wind/pubs/atlas/chp2.html “The wind resource assessment was based on surface wind data, coastal marine area data and upper-air data, where appli- cable. In data-sparse areas, three qualitative indicators of wind speed or power were used when applicable: topographic/me- teorological indicators (e.g. gorges, mountain summits, sheltered valleys); wind deformed vegetation; and eolian landforms (e.g. playas, sand dunes). The data was evaluated at a regional level to produce 12 regional wind resource assessments, the regional assessments were then incorporated into the national wind resource assessment. The conterminous United States was divided into grid cells 1/4 degree of latitude by 1/3 degree of longitude. Each grid cell was assigned a wind power class ranging from 1 to 6, with 6 being the windiest. The wind power density limits for each wind power class is shown in Table 1-1. Each grid cell contains sites of varying power class. The assigned wind power class is representative of the range of wind power densities likely to occur at exposed sites within the grid cell. Hilltops, ridge crests, mountain summits, large clearings, and other locations free of local obstruction to the wind are expected to be well exposed to the wind. In contrast, locations in narrow valleys and canyons, downwind of hills or obstructions, or in forested or urban areas are likely to have poor wind exposure...” Figure 1.19: Impervious Surfaces in Boston Also used in Figures 1.20 Source: Linnean Solutions, Gravelin, John. “Impervious Surfaces of Greater Boston” [map]. 1:200,000.

While different building ty\u0003pes are distributed throughout the city\u0003, some neighborhoods are more dense in specific categories of buildings than others . Sometimes this neighborhood grouping is a result of building age and history\u0003, sometimes it is a result of zoning by\u0003 the city\u0003, and in many\u0003 cases, results from a confluence of forces . For example, comparing the Allston neighborhood with the Leather District/Chinatown neighbor- hood, the differences in both building ty\u0003pe and age across the city\u0003 are apparent . Figures 1 .11 and 1 .12 show comparisons of building ty\u0003pe and age of buildings in the two neighborhoods . Nearly\u0003 85% of buildings in Allston were built before 1950, and over 75% of buildings are residential .

        "Strategies for Resilient Buildings in Boston SITE STABILIZE SLOPES SUSCEPTIBLE TO EROSION, LANDSLIDE, FIRE Increased precipitation and drought events will change the likelihood of erosion, landslide and fire on properties. Short-term erosion typically results from periodic natural events, such as flooding, hurricanes, storm surge, and windstorms, but may be intensified by human activities. Long-term erosion is a result of multi-year impacts such as repetitive flooding, wave action, sea level rise, sediment loss, subsidence, and climate change… Landslides occur when the slope or soil stability changes from stable to unstable, which may be caused by earthquakes, storms, vol- canic eruptions, erosion, fire, or additional human-induced activities. Potential impacts include environmental distur- bance, property and infrastructure damage, and injuries or fatalities.

In addition to public health problems, urban heat islands increase energy use and costs as well as pollution lev- els in cities, causing additional ill- ness. Adapting to Urban Heat, P 1 A high solar reflectance—or al- bedo—is the most important characteristic of a cool roof as it helps to reflect sunlight and heat away from a building, reducing roof temperatures. A high thermal emittance also plays a role, par- ticularly in climates that are warm and sunny. Together, these properties help roofs to absorb less heat and stay up to 50–60°F (28–33°C) cooler than conventional materials during peak summer weather. Building owners and roofing contractors have used cool roofing products for more than 20 years on commercial, industrial, and residential buildings. They may be installed on low- slope roofs (such as the flat or gently sloping roofs typically found on commercial, industrial, and office buildings) or the steep-sloped roofs used in many residences and retail buildings. EPA Cool Roofs Website Vegetated, or green roofs are a popular strategy to reduce Heat Island Effect in urban settings. The vegetation absords heat and uses it for evapotranspiration, reducing tem- perature rise associated with impermeable surfaces, like roofs.

Building Resiliency Task Force page BR-6 1 Passive ventilation strategies are equally important in residential and commercial properties of all scales, to help ensure continued usability of buildings during extended system outages. (Image: Marcus Springer) STRATEgIES • Use cross ventilation for passive cooling. Cross ventilation relies on the air pressure from the wind to remove heat from a space. Designing spaces o to allow for cross ventilation provides a passive method of cooling the building on warm days. In the event of a power failure, cross ventilation may allow the building to continue to be occupied even if there is no mechanical cooling present. Green Building and Climate Resilience p.1771 • Use stack ventilation for passive cooling. Designing spaces to allow hot air to rise up and out of the space provides a passive method to cool o the building on warm days. In the event of a power failure, stack ventilation may allow the building to continue to be occupied even if there is no mechanical cooling present. Green Building and Climate Resilience p.181 • Install ceiling fans. Electric fans increase indoor air speeds, helping to provide thermal comfort. When used in conjunction o with air conditioning, they can help to reduce energy use if the thermostat set point temperature is raised. This can reduce electrical energy demand and usage through the cooling season. Green Building and Climate Resilience p.185 • Consider thermal energy storage. Thermal energy storage can reduce energy demand during the daytime by producing chilled water at o night to reduce the load on mechanical systems and electrical grid. This approach can help a building to respond to increased temperatures by reducing peak daytime demand, allowing existing systems to respond greater demand for cooling without reconfiguration. Green Building and Climate Resilience p.187 • Insulate Water System. Insulating pipes helps to minimize heat loss and to protect cold water lines from freezing in the event of o extended loss of heating capability.

This will be done to help upper-floor residents who may lose access to such water in their units in the event of the failure of building electric pumps. A Stronger, More Resilient New York, plaNYC page 86 STRATEgIES • Use water catchment systems/cistern. Use water catchment systems include cisterns, storage tanks, and ponds. Tanks can be located above or o below ground to store water. Storage should be sized based on projected precipitation volumes in order to maximize the volume of water that can be captured during a storm event. Green Building and Climate Resilience p.2171 • Enhance building water reserves. Water towers can provide potable water by gravity during power losses. o Building Resiliency Task Force P 1433 • Develop agreements for secondary water sources. Secondary water sources can provide critical water supplies during emergencies or drought conditions. o FEMA Mitigation Ideas p.62 • Supply drinking water without power. During a power failure, residential buildings using electric pumps lose their supply of potable water. o Water may be present below the sixth floor, but in some cases remains unavailable if a non-operating pump blocks the water supply. Buildings need to designate one or more common areas on lower floors for potable water distribution. Building Resiliency Task Force P 132 • Ensure toilets & sinks work without power. Some toilets and faucets need electricity to function. To avoid a sanitation risk during an extended o power outage, use at least one non-electric toilet and faucet per bathroom, or Lavatory faucet sensors and toilet sensors with the required battery life or flushometer toilets with sensors providing a manual override.

        "The International green Construction Code and Resilience -A. Vernon Woodworth FAIA, LEED AP AKF Group, LLC The publication of the 2012 International green Construction Code (IgCC) marks a new direc- tion in the regulatory scope of building codes, focusing on sustainability rather than life-safety. The IgCC also offers a different format, with several compliance options, including the “ANSI/ ASHRAE/USGBC/IES Standard 189.1, Standard for the Design of High Performance, Green Build- ings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings”. The structure and much of the prescriptive content of the IgCC resembles LEED language translated into code format. A list of jurisdictional require- ments allows the code to be customized to local needs, and an appendix of “project electives” provides an additional level of flexibility at the discretion of the adopting jurisdiction. The IgCC was conceived and written as an overlay code, intended to be enforced in conjunc- tion with the other I-codes from the International Code Council: the IBC (International Building Code), the IRC (International Residential Code), the IPC (International Plumbing Code), and the IECC (International Energy Conservation Code). Its mandate is to establish a sustainable overlay on top of base code requirements. Therefore provisions for resiliency that do not address envi- ronmental sustainability, such as back-up power generation and sewage back-flow prevention, belong in the base codes rather than the IgCC. Although the term “resiliency” does not appear in the IgCC, many of the goals of this code will benefit the sustainability of the built environment in extreme weather events. Unlike any previous building code the IgCC contains provisions for site and land use that provide develop- ment buffers at wetlands and water bodies as well as mandatory storm water management requirements. These provisions can enhance absorption of storm surge and mitigate flooding. Permeable paving can also reduce run-off, which pollutes waterways and contributes to flood- ing. Provisions to reduce heat island effect will reduce cooling loads and facilitate survivability in heat waves. A project elective for vegetative roofs would contribute to the reduction of heat island effect and reduce storm water runoff. The heightened attention to issues of resiliency resulting from the devastation of Hurricane Sandy and several destructive tornados in the mid-west has stimulated discussion on the poten- tial role of building codes in disaster preparedness. Because the IgCC is scheduled to be updated every three years it is likely that a future edition will specifically address resiliency. However the overarching intent of the IgCC encompasses a larger scope: the overall impact of the built environment on ecosystems. Photo: John Gravelin Building Resilience in Boston 88 July 2013",

        "Leveraging Current Resources Section 5: Potential Next Steps Summary of Study Findings Emergency Response in Back Bay Neighborhood Resilience can be defined as the ability to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change. For cities like Boston, which was settled over 350 years ago, a critical aspect of resilience is adapting existing buildings to improve resilience to natural hazards, particularly in light of pending climate change impacts. The most common natural hazards in the Boston area are floods (including both rain events and coastal flooding with storm surge), severe storms (which include both rain and high wind conditions), and extreme temperatures (both hot and cold). A common secondary impact from extreme weather events is the loss of critical infrastructure services, including energy, water, wastewater, transportation, and communications. Climate change impacts are projected to exacerbate these extreme weather events, increasing both the frequency of the events as well as the magnitude of the impacts. As an example, sea level rise is expected to increase the incidence of coastal flooding, especially with storm surge, and the Photo: John Gravelin magnitude of the flooding will increase with the rising tides. More severe storms will, likewise, increase rain floods and ex- treme wind conditions, and increased ambient temperatures constructed post-WWII. Selected facilities may be vulnerable will likely increase the number of high heat degree days. to flooding (both in rain events as well as coastal flooding and storm surge) and all are extremely vulnerable to the loss Boston has the largest percentage of residential buildings of critical services.

Additional attention may needed to identify View from Boston’s Prudential Center these informal centers and to explicitly incorporate the up- grade of these facilities with respect to their higher density of vulnerable persons. Improving the resilience of existing buildings for climate change impacts requires direct consideration of a multi- hazard approach with proactive development and imple- mentation of upgrades. As noted above, expected climate change impacts will increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme events in Boston throughout the seasons, and prudent planning will consider all relevant hazards for each location and building type. Many of the adaptation strategies for buildings identified in this study improve resilience for several hazards at once and also provide additional benefits during normal conditions. A recent study found that, for each dollar invested in mitiga- tion, over $4 of benefits are provided (MMC, 2006). For example, a strategy to add trees to a site to increase shading reduces stormwater flow, lowers ambient temperatures, and lessens wind impacts as well as improving air quality and Photo: John Gravelin quality of life.

(2010). “Comparing European Residential Building Stocks: Performance, Reno- vation, and Policy Opportunities.” Building Research & Information 37:5-6, 533-551. The study noted that across 8 countries, the barriers to sustainability upgrades were lack of knowledge and the unconvinc- ing cost-benefit relation where there is not a guaranteed return on investment for the upgrade. The policy overview shows that all countries studied have adapted their building regulations in recent years in order to promote energy efficiency. In principle, energy requirements for new buildings need to be met when dwellings are drastically renovated, e.g. in Germany and the Netherlands. The implementation of this principle varies from a requirement at the component level (e.g. insulation values) to performance agreements for buildings. In Germany, when more than 20% of a component (wall, roof or window) is changed, the dwelling needs to meet building regulations comparable with those for new construction. In Sweden, a component must meet the equivalent requirements for the newly built. In the UK, any work on existing buildings is expected to meet minimum energy-efficiency standards. For specified major improvements in buildings with floor areas exceeding 1000 m2, where there is a potential to increase energy intensity, for example, by extending a building or installing air-condi- tioning, there are further energy-efficiency requirements, taking into account the consideration that these requirements are technically, functionally and economically feasible.

In 1994, President William Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minor- ity Populations and Low-Income Populations,” directing federal agencies to address environmental injustices in their opera- tions and in communities across the country. Since, and in accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, states and municipalities have developed policies and programs to pro-actively address environmental equity concerns to help ensure that minority and low-income communities are not disproportionately impacted by environmental hazards.” Detailed Description Quotations: Building Resilience in Boston 106 July 2013",

Any blockgroup with a minority population greater than 25% was selected as an EJ population. 2. Income The statewide median household income in 2000 (determined by the Dept. of Economic Development) was $46,947. 65% of this value is $30,515. Any blockgroup that had a median household income less than $30,515 is considered as an EJ popula- tion. 3. English Proficiency Linguistic isolation refers to a household in which no person 14 years old and over speaks only English and no person 14 years old and over who speaks a language other than English speaks English ‘‘Very well’’ is classified as ‘‘linguistically isolated.’’ In other words, a household in which all members 14 years old and over speak a non-English language and also speak Eng- lish less than ‘‘Very well’’ (have difficulty with English) is ‘‘linguistically isolated.’’ Figure 1.5: Boston Population Density Source: Linnean Solutions, Gravelin, John. “Population Density of Greater Boston” [map]. 1:200,000.

Wetland scientists and regulators use three principal types of wetland characteristics or “parameters” in defining, mapping, and delineating wetlands: • Vegetation. The types of plants that can live in wetlands are determined by the depth and duration of flooding and satura- tion. Vegetation is the most common paremeter used in defining, mapping, and delineating wetlands. There are over 7,000 plants which grow in wetlands in the U.S. A much smaller number, about 26%, are “obligate”. Obligate species grow only in wetlands and are strong indicators of wetland boundaries. “Facultative” plants grow in both wetlands and uplands and are a less good indicator but are useful when combined with soils and hydrologic information. • Evidence of hydrology. Hydrology (water depth, extent of inundation, period of inundation) determines all other wetland characteristics. However, hydrology is often not easily assessed. Often water can be observed at the surface only part of the year for many wetlands. Other evidence of hydrology (other than surface observation) may include flood records and flood maps, debris lines and evidence of flooding in trees and other vegetation, evidence of scour, and soils. Where there are uncertainties and disputes, field measurements of vegetation and soils may be taken over a growing season. Piezometers measuring water levels and hydrologic models may be used (although rare) to calculate the depth and frequency of inunda- tion and saturation and ground water levels. • Soils. Wetland soils often contain large amounts of organic matter because saturation prevents oxidation of plant materials. Soils reflect long term hydrology and are, therefore, useful in identifying wetlands even where hydrology and plants have been disturbed or during periods of drought.” Land Use Descriptions: (same land use source above) Brushland / Successional: Predominantly shrub cover, and some immature trees not large or dense enough to be classified as forest.

However categories 3 and 4 cause signifi- cant damage to parts of the city primarily because the elevation of the ocean would exceed that of the Charles River dam. Summary: The hurricane flooding layer was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hurricane Research Division Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory. The map chosen for the report represents the po- tential flood damage as provided by computer generated models that calculate the potential extent from different hurricane categories (Category 1,2,3 and 4). The highest category hurricane that has directly hit Boston in the past was a Category 3 Hurricane of 1869 (not named). The eye of this storm passed Boston ten miles inland and slowed to a Category 2 hurricane over New Hampshire and Maine. 29 different Hurricane and Tropical Storms and Depressions intersect a 50 miles radius of Boston.1 “Historical Hurricane Tracks.” National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

        "http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/F7.html Hurricane Categories defined directly as: “Maximum of MEOW (MOM) runs This is an ensemble product of maximum storm surge heights for all hurricanes of a given category regardless of forward speed, storm trajectory, landfall location, etc.. MOMs are created internally by pooling all the [Maximum Envelope of Water] MEOWs for a given basin, separated by category and tide level (zero/high), and selecting the MEOW with the greatest storm surge value for each basin grid cell regardless of the forward speed, storm trajectory, landfall location, etc. This procedure is done for each category of storm. Essentially, there is 1 MOM per storm category and tide level (zero/high). MOMs represent the worst case scenario for a given category of storm under “perfect” storm conditions. The MOMs provide useful information aiding in hurricane evacuation planning and are also used to develop the nation’s evaluation zones. The GIS models and values reflect the mean of the MOM results. ” Maximum Envelope of Water (MEOW) runs This is an ensemble product representing the maximum height of storm surge water in a given basin grid cell using hypo- thetical storms run with the same: Category (intensity) Foreward speed Storm trajectory Initial tide level Internally a number of parallel SLOSH runs with same intensity, forward speed, storm trajectory, and initial tide level are performed for the basin. The only difference in runs is that each is conducted at some distance to the left or right of the main track (typically at the center of the grid). Each component run computes a storm surge value for each grid cell. For example, five parallel runs may yield storm surge values of 4.1, 7.1, 5.3, 6.3, and 3.8 feet. In this case, the MEOW for the cell is 7.1 ft. It is unknown (to the user) which track generated the MEOW for a particular cell, so it is entirely possible that the MEOW values for adjacent cells may have come from different runs. MEOWs are used to incorporate the uncertainties associated with a given forecast and help eliminate the possibility that a critical storm track will be missed in which extreme storm surge val- ues are generated. MEOWs provide a worst case scenario for a particular category, forward speed, storm trajectory, and initial tide level incorpo- rating uncertainty in forecast landfall location. The results are typically generated from several thousand SLOSH runs for each basin. Over 80 MEOWs have been generated for some basins. This product provides useful information aiding in hurricane evacuation planning.

Silver Spring, Maryland. http://slosh. nws.noaa.gov/sloshPub/pubs/Vol-33-Nu1-Glahn.pdf Abstract: “The storm surge model, Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH), is used by the National Weather Service (NWS) in producing storm surge guidance in several ways. SLOSH is run by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to forecast storm surge in real-time when a hurricane is threatening. The model is applied to 38 specific coastal areas, called basins, along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the U.S.; Oahu, Hawaii; Puerto Rico; and the Virgin Islands. SLOSH is also used to create simulation studies to assist in the “hazards analysis” portion of hurricane evacuation planning by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and state and local emergency managers. Two composite products, Maximum Envelopes of Water (MEOW) and Maximum of the MEOWs (MOM), are created to provide manageable datasets for planning. The Probabilistic Storm Surge model (P-surge) overcomes the limitations of a single deterministic SLOSH storm surge forecast by being comprised of an ensemble of SLOSH forecasts. The members of the en- semble vary in speed, direction, intensity, and size, based on NHC’s forecast and past errors associated with NHC’s forecasts. P-surge is prompted to run when NHC issues a hurricane watch for the Atlantic or Gulf coasts. The Extratropical storm surge (ET surge) model uses SLOSH to forecast storm surge from extratropcial cyclones. The ET surge model uses surface wind and pressures that are generated by NWS’s Global Forecast System (GFS) model as driving forces.” Building Resilience in Boston 110 July 2013",

Notable exceptions occur along the Texas coast and Cape Cod in Massachusetts where the coastal wind resource extends inland a considerable distance.” http://rredc.nrel.gov/wind/pubs/atlas/chp2.html “The wind resource assessment was based on surface wind data, coastal marine area data and upper-air data, where appli- cable. In data-sparse areas, three qualitative indicators of wind speed or power were used when applicable: topographic/me- teorological indicators (e.g. gorges, mountain summits, sheltered valleys); wind deformed vegetation; and eolian landforms (e.g. playas, sand dunes). The data was evaluated at a regional level to produce 12 regional wind resource assessments, the regional assessments were then incorporated into the national wind resource assessment. The conterminous United States was divided into grid cells 1/4 degree of latitude by 1/3 degree of longitude. Each grid cell was assigned a wind power class ranging from 1 to 6, with 6 being the windiest. The wind power density limits for each wind power class is shown in Table 1-1. Each grid cell contains sites of varying power class. The assigned wind power class is representative of the range of wind power densities likely to occur at exposed sites within the grid cell. Hilltops, ridge crests, mountain summits, large clearings, and other locations free of local obstruction to the wind are expected to be well exposed to the wind. In contrast, locations in narrow valleys and canyons, downwind of hills or obstructions, or in forested or urban areas are likely to have poor wind exposure...” Figure 1.19: Impervious Surfaces in Boston Also used in Figures 1.20 Source: Linnean Solutions, Gravelin, John. “Impervious Surfaces of Greater Boston” [map]. 1:200,000.
