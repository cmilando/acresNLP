waterways are important environmental and economic resources for residents and visitors. The State of Vermont funds clean water projects to protect, enhance, and restore water quality across the state. Clean water projects are regulatory or non-regulatory practices or protections that address water pollution, including excess nutrients and sediment. The Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report, referred to hereafter as Report, summarizes efforts of state government, along with federal and local partners, to improve water quality across Vermont from state fiscal year (SFY) 2016 to 2023 (July 1, 2015–June 30, 2023). Clean Water Investments Vermont’s clean water funding helps municipalities, farmers, landowners, and nonprofit organizations implement clean water projects statewide. Collectively, state and federal funding programs, as well as regulatory requirements, drive clean water implementation efforts in Vermont. $100 $92.5 million $90 $80 $70 $64.4 million $62.6 million $58.5 million $60 $51.6 million $50.3 million $50 $40 $28.7 million $30 $20 $11.6 million $10 $0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 The State of Vermont invested over $420 million in clean water projects through grants, contracts, and loans from SFY 2016 to SFY 2023. The amount of funding awarded to clean water projects rose significantly between 2016 and 2023. Project funding varies annually based on project readiness, award timing, and economic factors. See Report Chapter 2 to learn more about clean water funding and investments. 6 sralloD deganaM etatS fo snoilliM SFY 2016–2023 Total: $420,184,095 State Fiscal Year (SFY) Agriculture Natural Resources Cross Sector Transportation Related Stormwater Stormwater Wastewater Figure ES-1: Dollars awarded by State of Vermont agencies to clean water projects statewide by land use sector, SFY 2016–2023.Clean Water Project Outputs Clean water projects work to improve water quality, and also provide co-benefits for the environment and local communities, such as increasing flood resilience, improving habitat function and biodiversity, supporting carbon sequestration, improving soil health, supporting workforce development, and providing local economic stimulus. The following table highlights some of the results of state and federally funded and regulatory projects completed from SFY 2016 to 2023. See Report Chapter 2 to learn more about clean water project outputs.

TMDLs identify water pollution (e.g., phosphorus) reductions required to restore water quality. The figures below show the estimated total phosphorus load reduction (metric tons per year) achieved by clean water project implementation thus far in the Lake Champlain (left) and Lake Memphremagog (right) basins. Estimates include the results of projects implemented through state and federal funding programs and in response to regulatory requirements. See Report Chapters 3 and 4 for more information. 50 45.0 42.7 41.5 40 33.2 30 27.5 21.4 19.0 20 12.9 10 0 Figure ES-2: Annual estimated total phosphorus load reductions (metric tons per year) associated with reported clean water projects in the Lake Champlain (left) and Lake Memphremagog (right) basins during SFY 2016–2023 by land use sector. Over the past eight state fiscal years, the state has made substantial progress towards reaching the water quality targets outlined in the state's large-scale phosphorus TMDLs, with 20% of the required reduction achieved to date in the Lake Champlain basin and 14% of the required reduction achieved to date in the Lake Memphremagog basin. Achieving the water quality goals outlined in the state’s large-scale TMDLs is not a linear path — variance in the rate of progress is to be expected over the 20-year implementation period. The rate of progress in estimated phosphorus reductions in both the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog basins has slowed in SFY 2023, however several ongoing factors are expected to accelerate the rate of progress in future years, including: 8 noitcudeR daoL surohpsohP latoT detamitsE nisaB nialpmahC ekaL eht ni )raeY/snoT cirteM( 2.5 2.1 2.0 2.1 2 1.9 1.7 1.5 1.0 1 0.5 0.5 0.2 0 State Fiscal Year (SFY) noitcudeR daoL surohpsohP latoT detamitsE nisaB gogamerhpmeM ekaL eht ni )raeY/snoT cirteM( State Fiscal Year (SFY)• State funding programs at the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation have shifted to block grant structures that rely on regional partners to manage and administer funding of individual projects. The transition to regional administration of clean water funding is anticipated to empower community partners, reduce bottlenecks, and increase the impact of clean water investments. • Vermont has received an influx in federal funding under the American Rescue Plan Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as increased Clean Water Fund revenue enacted under Act 76 of 2019. Program expansion supported by this funding will drive clean water project implementation across sectors. • The State of Vermont has been expanding clean water regulatory, financial, and technical assistance programs since SFY 2016. Many regulatory programs are now in place that will drive meaningful progress in the agriculture and developed lands sectors. • The State is investing to expand the capacity of the clean water workforce. Investments in our partner network to support capacity expansion are expected to increase clean water progress and reduce reporting lags. • The State is expanding its ability to fully capture results in its tracking and reporting, such as estimating phosphorus reductions for additional project types in the natural resources sector. Enhanced tracking and reporting will provide a more complete picture of progress on the ground. Continued effort, investment, and coordination are critical in the state’s ability to reach its water quality goals. The Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report serves as a useful tool to provide accountability on the state’s clean water progress and to inform adaptive management. By taking an adaptive management approach, the state will continue to identify and prioritize its resources to break down barriers to project implementation and clean water progress. Clean water project implementation is an important piece of climate resilience work and clean water projects have co-benefits like increased flood resilience, improved carbon sequestration, better soil health, and improved habitat function and biodiversity. In addition to achieving water quality goals, Vermont’s work to improve water quality directly supports climate adaptation and flood mitigation, which will increase the state’s resilience to future climate related stressors. 9Chapter 1: Introduction Vermont’s lakes, rivers, wetlands, and reservoirs are important environmental and economic resources for residents and visitors. Vermont’s waterways provide safe drinking water and recreational opportunities for thousands of people and support local economies by fostering tourism. High-quality streams, lakes, and wetlands also support wildlife habitat and increase flood resilience for local communities. The State of Vermont has made it a priority to support partners’ work to restore, enhance, and protect Vermont’s water quality. This includes work to address priority sources of nutrient and sediment pollution. This report summarizes the efforts of the state government and its partners to improve water quality across Vermont since the passage of Act 64, Vermont’s Clean Water Act, in 2015. Protecting and Restoring Clean Water in Vermont Vermont’s waterways vary in quality — some waters are of exceptional quality and require protection, and some waters suffer from excess pollution and require restoration. Impaired waters requiring restoration are a priority to mitigate adverse impacts on ecosystems, human health, and economic activity. In Vermont, a primary water quality challenge of concern is pollution caused by excess sediment and nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, originating from the land and carried to waterways through runoff. Nonpoint source pollution results from sediment and nutrients from the land being transported to waterways by rainfall and snowmelt traveling through agricultural fields, roads, parking lots, forests, and streambanks. Nonpoint source pollution is more difficult to manage than point source pollution, which enters waterways from an easily identified and confined place, such as a discharge pipe from a wastewater treatment facility. Excess phosphorus loading can lead to cyanobacteria blooms in Vermont’s lakes (Figure 1).4 Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are a natural component of surface waters and provide important ecological services, such as photosynthesis and the transfer of nitrogen from the atmosphere to the aquatic environment through nitrogen fixation. However, cyanobacteria blooms can produce toxins that may be harmful to people, animals, and the environment. The Vermont Department of Health, Vermont Department of Environmental Figure 1: Cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Champlain. Conservation (DEC), and partners Credit: Lake Champlain Committee monitor cyanobacteria blooms around the state and notify the public when cyanobacteria blooms make it unsafe to recreate at designated monitoring locations.5 4 To learn more about phosphorus, water pollution, and cyanobacteria, read this clean water plain language one-pager. 5 Information related to public health and safety of recreating in Vermont’s waterbodies is available through the Vermont Department of Health, here: https://www.healthvermont.gov/environment/tracking/cyanobacteria-blue-green-algae-tracker 10Clean water restoration plans, known as Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), identify pollutant reductions required for an impaired waterbody to meet the State of Vermont’s water quality standards. TMDLs set up long term pollutant reduction targets to mitigate both nonpoint source and point source pollution. Most of the State of Vermont is covered by three large-scale TMDLs that require nutrient loading reductions, as shown in Figure 2. Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog TMDLs target phosphorus pollution to address cyanobacteria blooms and other excess algae and aquatic plant growth. The five-state Long Island Sound TMDL targets nitrogen pollution, which causes low dissolved oxygen and dead zones in the Sound. The State of Vermont also has numerous small-scale TMDLs across the state.6 Coordinated implementation of large-scale and small-scale TMDLs supports local and regional water quality restoration. Figure 2: Vermont's large-scale TMDLs that require nutrient pollutant reductions. Tactical Planning Basins also shown. Vermont’s Clean Water Act (Act 64 of 2015) To further the state’s work to restore, enhance, and protect Vermont’s water quality, and to provide reasonable assurance on the state’s ability to meet nonpoint source pollution reduction targets outlined by the TMDLs, Vermont’s Clean Water Act (Act 64 of 2015) was signed into law in June 2015. The Act strengthened the regulatory and financial structures available to address sources of water pollution, with a focus on sediment and nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen). The Act established the Clean Water Fund to provide a financial mechanism to support clean water work statewide. Act 64 also initiated accountability and transparency requirements to track and report on the progress of water quality improvement efforts receiving state financial support and obligations through state regulatory requirements. 6 For more information on TMDLs in Vermont, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/map/tmdl 11Prioritizing Clean Water Actions The State of Vermont uses the Tactical Basin Planning process to identify and prioritize clean water projects Public Input Project that will provide the greatest return on investment Identification & & Plan Implementation through achievement of water quality restoration goals.

Each Tactical Basin Plan contains Figure 3: Five-Year Tactical Basin a list of priority projects and strategies necessary to Planning Process achieve clean water goals.7 Clean Water Projects Clean water projects, described in Table 1 and throughout this report, refer to regulatory or non- regulatory practices or actions that restore, enhance, and protect Vermont’s water quality.8 All land use sectors contribute to Vermont’s water quality challenges and all sectors have opportunities for improvement. Clean water projects are categorized into land use sectors based on the dominant land use of the area surrounding the project. Clean water projects help to support compliance with the Vermont and federal Clean Water Acts and may help to leverage additional federal funds. Examples of some clean water projects by land use sector are provided in the table below, along with a summary of the additional benefits clean water projects provide. Clean water projects provide co-benefits for the environment and local communities, such as increasing flood resilience, improving habitat function and biodiversity, supporting carbon sequestration, improving soil health, supporting workforce development, and providing local economic stimulus. 7 To learn more about Tactical Basin Planning in Vermont, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/watershed-planning 8 Clean water project may be defined differently or more narrowly in certain contexts, such as in relation to Act 76 of 2019. 12Table 1: Clean water project land use sectors, objectives, examples, and additional benefits.

The report also summarizes how state funding programs, federal funding programs, and regulatory requirements contribute to achieving the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog TMDLs.9 Data presented in this report are representative of the most complete available data at the close of the state fiscal year. Data reported in previous years is subject to change in future annual reports as project information becomes available. This report fulfills state statutory and federal reporting requirements, as outlined on Page 2. The Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report is divided into chapters based on geographic region. The purpose of each geographically focused chapter is to report progress in each of Vermont’s major nutrient TMDL watersheds. Figure 4 shows a map of the geographic regions with large-scale nutrient TMDLs and corresponding chapter numbers.10 Chapter 2 - Statewide Chapter 4 - Lake Chapter 3 - Lake Memphremagog Champlain Basin Basin Chapter 5 - Connecticut River Basin Figure 4: Geographic scope and focus of the Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report chapters. Collectively, state funding programs, federal funding programs, and regulatory requirements drive clean water efforts in Vermont. All three program categories work together to achieve 9 The State of Vermont also has numerous small-scale TMDLs. For example, Lake Carmi in Franklin County also suffers from cyanobacteria blooms, thus the Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load for Lake Cami was established in 2009. Since Lake Carmi is located in the Lake Champlain basin, actions to reduce phosphorus pollution in Lake Carmi support both the implementation of the Lake Carmi TMDL and Lake Champlain TMDL. Implementation of large-scale and small-scale TMDLs can support both local and regional water quality priorities. 10 Results in the Hudson River drainage basin are included in the statewide results reported in Chapter 2 and can be viewed in the Clean Water Interactive Dashboard: https://anrweb.vt.gov/DEC/cleanWaterDashboard/ 14water quality goals, and in some cases are complimented by additional funding from private sources and local contributions. For example, state funds leverage federal funds, and some funding programs support the cost of regulatory compliance. The following table summarizes clean water funding programs managed by the State of Vermont that are included in this report.

The results of USDA-NRCS- and LCBP-funded clean water projects are included in this report to show TMDL progress, but funding administered directly by federal entities are not included in 15statewide investments as they are outside the scope of this report, which focuses on how state administered funds are being spent.11 Several state regulatory programs are in place to protect, maintain, and restore water quality by establishing land use and management requirements that minimize discharges and runoff to surface waters. Regulatory requirements that are in place to protect the state’s natural resources but do not have a direct link to water quality improvement are outside the scope of this report. Table 3 summarizes which regulatory programs are included in this report and what programs will be included in the future.

Results are assigned to a state fiscal year based on the completion date of the project and are only reported once a project is complete. Pollution reduction estimates are modeled at the project level based on the total pollutant load from the land being treated by a project and the average or expected pollutant reduction efficiency of the project type.15 Pollutant reduction measures are estimated nutrient load reductions Annual pollutant reductions apply throughout the expected lifespan of a achieved by clean water projects. project, beginning on the date the project is completed.16 At present, total phosphorus load reductions are tracked and reported for the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog basins only. 14 To view available data on investment, project output, and pollution reduction measures supported by other funding and regulatory efforts, and by individual basin, please visit the Clean Water Interactive Dashboard: https://anrweb.vt.gov/DEC/cleanWaterDashboard/ 15 Estimated pollutant reductions are presented in delivered loads, or the pollutant load reduction after accounting for estimated pollutant storage or deposition en route to the receiving waterbody. Beginning with the Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2021 Performance Report, reporting of total phosphorus load reduction was revised to be presented in terms of delivered load to increase the accuracy of reporting on progress compared to the TMDL. 16 Additional information on the methods used to estimate pollutant reductions can be found on the Clean Water Tracking and Accounting webpage: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/cwi/projects/tracking-accounting 17Explore Clean Water Project Data with Online Tools The State of Vermont coordinates across agencies to track clean water efforts in a centralized database known as the Clean Water Reporting Framework. The database is used to compile and summarize project data to produce this report. These data and many online tools are made available to the public through the Clean Water Portal.17 The Portal’s Clean Water Project Explorer allows interested parties to search for and learn details about individual state-funded clean water projects (Figure 5). The Explorer also contains potential projects identified through Tactical Basin Planning. The Portal’s Clean Water Interactive Dashboard allows interested parties to view investment data, project output measures, and estimated pollutant reductions presented in this report by watershed (Figure 6). Figure 5: Sample Clean Water Project Explorer search results (left) and individual project report (right). Figure 6: The Clean Water Interactive Dashboard homepage. 17 The Project Explorer and Clean Water Interactive Dashboard can be accessed via the Clean Water Portal: https://anrweb.vt.gov/DEC/cleanWaterDashboard/ 18Chapter 2: Statewide Clean Water Investments and Results The State of Vermont’s clean water investments are channeled through grant, loan, and assistance programs to strategically restore and safeguard the state’s rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and wetlands. These funds are used to help identify and prioritize clean water projects, as well as to design, implement, and, in some cases, maintain projects. The State of Vermont tracks outputs of state investments at the project level to quantify the impact of clean water efforts statewide. This chapter summarizes statewide investments awarded to clean water projects by State of Vermont agencies as well as project output measures achieved through completion of clean water projects funded by State of Vermont agencies. Vermont’s Clean Water Funding The State of Vermont is committed to maintaining and improving water quality through financial and technical assistance and regulation. Vermont's clean water funding helps municipalities, farmers, landowners, and nonprofit organizations implement projects that will restore, enhance, and protect Vermont’s water quality. Funds from state programs complement and leverage other funding sources to support clean water efforts statewide. The Vermont Clean Water Board and Budget Process The Clean Water Board was created as a result of Act 64 of 2015, Vermont’s Clean Water Act, and is responsible for planning, coordinating, and financing the restoration, enhancement, and protection of Vermont’s water quality. Composed of representatives from five state agencies and four members of the public, the Board recommends to the Governor an annual Clean Water Budget that is made up of Clean Water Fund, Capital Bill, and American Rescue Plan Act dollars.18 Once the budget is recommended and approved by the Legislature, the funds are awarded to multiple state agencies and affiliates that work to address water quality challenges across land use sectors. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) is part of the federal COVID-19 response to address economic impacts due to the pandemic. The State of Vermont will receive $1.026 billion in ARPA funds to invest in broadband infrastructure, clean water, climate action, housing, and economic development to be encumbered by December 31, 2024 and expended by the end of calendar year 2026. The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources is responsible for distributing a portion of these ARPA funds to support water and wastewater infrastructure programs.19 A subset of the ARPA funding was 18 To learn more, visit the Clean Water Board webpage: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/cwi/board 19 Visit the ANR ARPA webpage for more information on types of water and wastewater infrastructure programs: https://anr.vermont.gov/special-topics/arpa-vermont 19appropriated to the Clean Water Board and will be distributed (SFY 2022–SFY 2024) to support new and existing clean water programs across multiple state agencies.20 While the Clean Water Budget is a major source for funding clean water efforts statewide, many state agencies and affiliates pair Clean Water Budget dollars with other state or federal funds to complement and expand upon their clean water efforts. 20 View approved Clean Water Budget allocations for a full list of ARPA funding distributed by the Clean Water Board on the Clean Water Board’s webpage: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/cwi/board 20Vermont’s Statewide Clean Water Investments The State of Vermont distributes funding through agencies to a wide range of organizations to support all phases of clean water work across land use sectors. The following sections summarize statewide investments in clean water projects by land use sector, funding source, and project step over the past eight state fiscal years.21 State Investments by Land Use Sector Reaching Vermont’s water quality goals requires investments across all land use sectors. The following figure summarizes state clean water investments by land use sector statewide over the past eight state fiscal years, from SFY 2016 to 2023. $100 $92.5 million $90 $80 $64.4 million $70 $62.6 million $58.5 million $60 $51.6 million $50.3 million $50 $40 $28.7 million $30 $20 $11.6 million $10 $0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Figure 7: Total dollars awarded by State of Vermont agencies to clean water projects statewide by land use sector, SFY 2016–2023. Explanation of Figure 7 The State of Vermont has invested over $420 million in clean water projects statewide from SFY 2016 to 2023. Annual clean water investments have increased significantly since SFY 2016, but funding awarded to projects varies from year-to-year based on project readiness and the timing of awards. In SFY 2021, COVID-19’s economic impacts affected Clean Water Fund revenue sources and capacity to administer and implement projects, which led to a slight reduction in appropriation and a temporary slowdown of funding programs. Funding levels recovered in SFY 2022 and 2023, supported in part by a short-term influx of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) dollars. 21 To view clean water investments by basin, visit the Clean Water Interactive Dashboard: https://anrweb.vt.gov/DEC/cleanWaterDashboard/ 21 sralloD deganaM etatS fo snoilliM Click symbol to view description of accountability measures.

Most of the cross sector funding represents block grant awards to Funding Program Administrators tasked with administering a grant program and issuing sub-grants to support clean water projects across a range of land use sectors. Once the block grants are completed, dollars will be reallocated to the appropriate sector based on the project types that were awarded funding.22 State Investments by Funding Source Clean Water State Federal Transportation Revolving Fund Fund State Transportation 28.00% 5.29% Municipal Planning Grant Fund Recapture 1.32% 0.01% ARPA 7.37% Watershed USDA NRCS Grant Fund 6.31% 0.12% Lake Champlain AAFM Special Basin Program Funds 4.52% 0.04% Act 250 Mitigation Fund Housing & Capital Bill 0.40% Conservation Clean Water Fund 23.22% Trust Fund 19.54% 2.88% General Fund 0.98% SFY 2016–2023 Total: $420,184,095 Figure 8: Proportion of dollars awarded to clean water projects through State of Vermont agencies by funding or financing source, SFY 2016–2023.23 Explanation of Figure 8 State agencies’ clean water investments are supported by a variety of funding sources. The annual Clean Water Budget is made up of Clean Water Fund and a portion of Capital Bill dollars, comprising about one third of clean water investments. Several federal funding sources administered by state agencies are considered state investments, including Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF), Federal Transportation funds, some U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA- NRCS) funds, and some Lake Champlain Basin Program funds. Direct investments by federal agencies or other organizations are beyond the scope of this report. 22 To learn more about current Clean Water Initiative Program funding programs, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/water- investment/cwi/grants/opportunities 23 Investments reported include state and federal dollars awarded to projects by state agencies, but exclude federal funds awarded directly by federal agencies and the Lake Champlain Basin Program, as the focus of this report is state funding. 22Investments and Leveraged Contributions by Land Use Sector State-funded clean water projects leverage local and federal contributions to help cover project costs and to further clean water efforts in Vermont. Loans are considered leverage as they are mostly paid back to the state for continued lending. The following figure summarizes leveraged contributions from SFY 2016 to 2023 by land use sector. $200 37% 69% $150 52% $100 30% 24% $50 4% $0 Agriculture Wastewater Natural Transportation Stormwater Cross Sector Resources Related Stormwater Figure 9: State investments (grants, contracts, and Clean Water Fund operating) and leveraged contributions (local match/in-kind, federal match, and state loans) reported through State of Vermont agencies by land use sector, SFY 2016–2023. Percent represents the proportion of leveraged contributions out of the total reported funds within each sector. Explanation of Figure 9 State-funded clean water projects leverage local and federal contributions to help cover project costs and to further clean water efforts. Leveraged contributions (local match/in- kind, federal match, and state loans) since SFY 2016 total $246 million and represent 44 percent of the total $554 million in clean water funds reported SFY 2016 through SFY 2023. Most reported wastewater funds are low-interest loans made to municipalities through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund that will ultimately be paid back to the state (except for some loan subsidies). Match contributions reported here only include local match/in-kind (private contributions, municipal funds, and volunteer labor) and federal match reported through State of Vermont grants and contracts, where data is available. Clean Water Fund Operating refers to limited AAFM and ANR personnel funded through the Clean Water Fund to support implementation efforts and is not considered leveraged contribution. This report mainly focuses on passthrough funds administered by state agencies and this figure is the only funding figure that includes the Clean Water Fund Operating funding category. This category represents a fraction of the substantial staffing costs associated with clean water work. State agency investments in personnel, operating, and monitoring activities are beyond the scope of this report. 23 )3202–6102 YFS( sralloD fo snoilliM Total reported funds: $554,179,844 Total leveraged contributions: $246,057,263 State Grants and Contracts Clean Water Fund Operating State Loans Local Match/In-kind Federal MatchState Investments by Project Step Making wise investments in cost-effective clean water projects requires thorough project planning, analysis, design, and implementation. In addition, operation and maintenance of existing projects is important to sustaining project function and clean water outcomes. Investing in the project development process is key to ensuring state investments will yield the greatest water quality improvement per dollar, which includes de-prioritizing lower-value or non-viable projects early in development. The following figure summarizes the percentage of funding awarded to various steps of the clean water project development process during SFY 2016 to 2023. Targeted Water Quality Monitoring Research of Innovative 0.3% Other Nutrient Pollution 3.4% Control Strategies 0.4% Education, Outreach, Technical Assistance, and Agency and Partner Operational Support 5.8% Planning, Assessment, Project Design and and Analytics to Identify Engineering Priority Projects 7.7% 3.2% Project Implementation/Construction 79.2% Figure 10: Percentage of dollars awarded by State of Vermont agencies to various steps of the clean water project development process, SFY 2016–2023. Explanation of Figure 10 While the state invests in all project steps, nearly 80 percent of clean water investments are used to construct or implement clean water projects that restore, enhance, and protect Vermont’s water quality. Approximately 10 percent of clean water investments are used in the planning, design, and engineering phases. Targeted water quality monitoring represents passthrough funds that are used to support focused, small watershed scale monitoring, but does not capture all water quality monitoring efforts in Vermont. The “Other” category includes agreements that do not fit squarely into one project step, including multiple block grants issued to partners who will use the money to develop, design, and implement several projects. Once those projects are completed, dollars may be reallocated to the appropriate step. 24Vermont’s Statewide Education, Outreach, and Technical Assistance Click symbol to view description of accountability measures. Reducing nutrient and sediment pollution sources requires employing sound land management practices which can necessitate changes to our cities and towns, farms, forests, and natural spaces. Education and outreach related to clean water projects and programs is critical to achieve our water quality goals. The State of Vermont delivers clean water education through outreach (workshops, trainings, and public/stakeholder meetings) and technical assistance (targeted, one-on-one interactions). Clean water education, outreach, and technical assistance aim to: • Increase public awareness and engagement in establishing and implementing clean water priorities; • Increase landowner acceptance of new and changing policies and willingness to adopt best management practices; • Support regulated entities in preparing to meet new regulatory requirements in the most cost-effective manner; • Support clean water project proponents, including regulated entities, in building expertise to develop, plan, and secure resources to implement clean water projects; and • Increase adoption and effectiveness of best management practices to improve water quality. Educational efforts support all land use sectors in planning and securing resources to implement clean water projects. The following section summarizes education, outreach, and technical assistance efforts by land use sector. Clean Water Outreach by Organization Reported outreach is provided by state reporting partners, as well as partners who receive clean water funding from state agencies to conduct outreach. The following figure summarizes the total hours of education provided by outreaching organizations from SFY 2016 to 2023. 253,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Figure 11: Total hours of education provided to participants of State of Vermont-funded clean water outreach events (workshops, trainings, and public/stakeholder meetings) by outreach organization or organization category, SFY 2016–2023.24 Explanation of Figure 11 In total, 3,005 outreach events have been reported, reaching over 90,799 attendees, with over 339,000 hours of education received by attendees since SFY 2016. In SFY 2020 to 2023, there was a decrease in the overall number of outreach events reported compared to previous years. This is in part related to the COVID-19 pandemic limiting in-person outreach. The need for, and the resources available to support, clean water outreach efforts fluctuate. For example, outreach efforts were critical in the development of foundational programs to drive Vermont’s clean water efforts, including the initial phases of implementing the Lake Champlain TMDL and the Vermont Clean Water Act (Act 64 of 2015). More recently, outreach efforts have supported partners in the development and implementation of programs under Act 76 of 2019. As these programs move from development and launch into implementation, the need for continued education and outreach events on these topic areas may be reduced. Note, the entities responsible for reporting outreach efforts are ANR, AAFM, VTrans, and external partners conducting outreach under the scope of a state grant or contract agreement, however many events include multiple outreaching organizations. Outreach not directly conducted by state agencies and/or supported by state funding are not included in these data. 24 For presentation purposes, the figure above includes organizations that reported more than zero hours of education between SFY 2016 and SFY 2023 grouped into the categories above. “Agricultural Associations” include both regional and statewide organizations connecting and supporting the agricultural sector. “Other” includes ECO AmeriCorps, Lake Champlain Basin Program, Lake Champlain Sea Grant, Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, Vermont League of Cities & Towns, and Federation of Vermont Lakes & Ponds. 26 dedivorP hcaertuO fo sruoH State Fiscal Year (SFY) Other Watershed Organizations VTrans Vermont Rural Water Association UVM Extension USDA-NRCS Regional Planning Commissions Natural Resources Conservation Districts ANR Agricultural Associations AAFMClean Water Outreach by Target Audience State of Vermont outreach events reach a diverse range of audiences.

Businesses Loggers and 4% Foresters 2% Residential Landowners 5% Natural Resources Conservation Districts Public 6% 19% Other Governmental Organizations 6% Regional Planning Commissions Municipalities 7% 18% Consultants 8% Nongovernmental Farmers Organizations 13% 12% Figure 12: State of Vermont clean water outreach efforts between SFY 2016–2023 reached a total of 197,107 attendees. Percentages reflect the proportion of total attendees in each target audience. Explanation of Figure 12 The state’s outreach efforts target a wide range of different sector- and organization- based audiences. One of the state’s water quality priorities is to support municipalities and farmers in addressing stormwater, wastewater, and agricultural sources of nutrient pollution, which is why these audiences represent a large proportion of the target audiences above. In addition, regional planning commissions and non-governmental organizations, such as watershed groups and natural resource conservation districts, play an important role in working with municipalities, farmers, and other landowners to secure funds to implement priority clean water projects. It is crucial to keep the public engaged to broaden support of the state’s clean water efforts and bolster landowner willingness to adopt and implement voluntary, non-regulatory clean water projects. 27Technical Assistance by Land Use Sector State of Vermont agencies and partners provide technical assistance to regulated and non- regulated audiences who implement clean water projects. While not all technical assistance provided by state agencies can be tracked, the following table summarizes available data on technical assistance efforts by land use sector since SFY 2016. Table 4: State of Vermont technical assistance efforts by sector.

In the developed lands sector, DEC and VTrans staff provide technical assistance to prepare municipalities and other regulated entities to comply with water quality-related regulations. DEC Water Investment Division engineers provided over 38,800 hours of technical assistance on municipal stormwater and wastewater projects from SFY 2016 to 2023, while VTrans staff provided over 8,500 hours of water quality technical assistance to municipalities. In the natural resources sector, projects are voluntary and not driven by regulation. Education targeting the public and landowners increases the likelihood of natural resource restoration projects moving forward. Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation (DFPR) staff conducted 126 site visits to provide technical assistance on Acceptable Management Practices at logging operations. The Vermont Urban and Community Forestry Program provided technical assistance to communities over 840 times from SFY 2016 to SFY 2023 related to planning for and managing urban trees. 26 Data are reported by calendar year rather than state fiscal year. Given the timeline of this report, calendar year 2023 data are not yet available and calendar year 2022 data are reported. DFPR’s annual statewide summary reports are available at: https://fpr.vermont.gov/forest/managing-your-woodlands/acceptable-management-practices 27 Data are reported by calendar year rather than state fiscal year. Given the timeline of this report, calendar year 2023 data are not yet available and calendar year 2022 data are reported. 28 Data are reported by federal fiscal year (October 1–September 30) rather than state fiscal year. 29Technical assistance efforts across sectors have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting or altering in-person interactions, particularly evidenced by a drop in visit numbers across many technical assistance metrics in SFY 2020–2022. Figure 13: The Vermont Urban & Community Forestry Program’s, Gwen Kozlowski, and Southern Windsor County Forester, Hannah Dallas, plant one of eleven trees on public property in Windsor.

Clean water projects restore, enhance, and protect water quality by addressing the sources and causes of sediment and nutrient pollution across land use sectors. The following section summarizes the results of state-funded and regulatory clean water projects completed statewide to improve the state’s water quality. Some measures have been rounded to the nearest whole number for reporting purposes, but totals have been calculated using unrounded numbers.29 Statewide Results of Agricultural Pollution Prevention Projects Agricultural pollution prevention projects involve the installation or application of conservation practices that reduce sources of nutrient and sediment pollution from farm production areas and agricultural fields. The following table summarizes project outputs associated with state-funded agricultural pollution prevention projects, technical assistance, and regulatory programs. Table 5: Outputs of state-funded agricultural pollution prevention projects implemented statewide since SFY 2016. Total Trend Project Output Measures30 SFY 2023 SFY 2016–2023 SFY 2016–2023 Acres of agricultural conservation practices implemented (excluding 26,905 141,317 practice types listed below)31 Acres of agricultural forested and 32 256 filter strip buffers installed 29 For a full record of project output measures by state fiscal year, visit the Clean Water Interactive Dashboard here: https://anrweb.vt.gov/DEC/cleanWaterDashboard/ 30 Agricultural project output measures can overlap with other project output measures if multiple practices were applied on the same field. For example, 10 acres of manure injection and 10 acres of cover crop applied on the same field will amount to 20 acres of agricultural conservation practices implemented in reported project outputs. Similarly, practices implemented on the same field over multiple years will be counted for each year implemented. For example, 10 acres of cover crop implemented on the same field in 2016, 2017, and 2018 will amount to 30 acres of agricultural conservation practices implemented in reported project outputs. The total agricultural project outputs column represents the total level of effort of state funding programs, rather than the number of distinct agricultural acres addressed. 31 Acres of agricultural conservation practices includes aeration, conservation crop rotation, cover crop, crop to hay, grassed waterways, manure injection, conservation tillage, and rotational grazing. 31Total Trend Project Output Measures30 SFY 2023 SFY 2016–2023 SFY 2016–2023 Acres of pasture with livestock 64 345 excluded from surface water Number of structural agricultural practices installed in 100 749 barnyard/production areas, fields, and pastures Acres of water quality protections within newly conserved 645 2,101 agricultural lands Acres of agricultural land treated 18,160 127,520 through innovative equipment32 Project Output Measures Total Trend Supported by State Technical SFY 2023 SFY 2016–2023 SFY 2016–2023 Assistance33 Acres of agricultural conservation practices implemented with 3,287 34,643 support of state-funded technical assistance Agricultural Regulatory Total Trend SFY 2023 Measures SFY 2016–2023 SFY 2016–2023 Acres of production area inspected by AAFM for RAP 3,014 15,703 compliance34 32 Examples of innovative equipment include manure injection equipment and drag lines. 33 Agricultural conservation practices reported through technical assistance represent agricultural conservation practices implemented without direct financial assistance to farmers from state and federal programs. These practices are reported through technical assistance efforts which are funded by state programs. 34 SFY 2016–2018 datasets are incomplete and do not fully account for all acres of production area inspected by AAFM for RAP compliance due to the initiation of this tracking mechanism. 32Explanation of Table 5 The number of agricultural pollution prevention projects implemented statewide has consistently increased each year since SFY 2016. Many of the project output measures tracked in the agricultural sector show impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on implementation rates between SFY 2021–2022. Unlike in other sectors, many clean water practices implemented in the agricultural sector have an effective life of one year and require continued implementation year-after-year to sustain results. Additionally, agricultural practices are inherently subject to weather and soil conditions for the season and thus fluctuating levels of implementation are based on farm business decisions, landowner willingness, and ability to implement. Figure 14: Grassland Shallow Slot Manure Injection equipment is a very shallow manure injection method which causes a low level of soil disturbance. This application method significantly reduces surface phosphorus application and nutrient loss while increasing efficiency and crop production. This equipment purchase was funded through the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets Capital Equipment Assistance Program.

Natural infrastructure includes floodplains, river channels, lakeshores, wetlands, and forestlands. The following table summarizes project outputs associated with state-funded natural resources restoration projects. Project development measures reflect efforts in the identification, prioritization, and design of projects. Project output measures reflect the impact of project implementation or construction.

Ongoing work to develop tools and resources to streamline these processes will support targeted re-assessments in priority areas of the state. Most natural resource restoration projects reflected in this report are voluntary, and results may vary year-to-year depending on landowner willingness to participate, partner capacity, the timing of reporting, and other factors. Landowner outreach and investment in partner capacity to complete these types of projects is a crucial component to continued progress in clean water work in the natural resource sector. Annual variation in the level of project outputs reported is also partially attributable to some project types in the natural resource sector requiring multi-year planning and design work, legal agreements, and partner coordination. Figure 17: During (left) and after (right) removal of the Dunklee Pond dam. Removal of this 75-foot-long concrete dam reconnected 13 stream miles of the Tenney Brook, a tributary to East Creek in Rutland, Vermont. Removal of dams that are no longer actively used provides important water quality benefits — it allows river reaches to return to a natural process of evolution, reduces sediment transport to receiving waters, improves aquatic habitat, and increases flood resilience. The removal of this dam was funded by the Department of Environmental Conservation in partnership with the Vermont Natural Resources Council. The project was completed in the spring of 2022. Figure 18: The Lake Champlain TMDL Phase 1 Implementation Plan highlights forests as an important area for reducing phosphorus loading to state waters, representing 75% of Vermont’s total land base. Inadequate infrastructure is one cause of erosion on state forestland. Replacement of infrastructure not only reduces phosphorus loading to waterbodies, but also improves stream habitat and maintains public access for recreation and logging operations. This project included replacement of an undersized and collapsed cross drainage culvert (before, left) with an appropriately sized, aligned culvert (after, right) on a forest road in Mount Mansfield State Forest, located within the Lake Champlain basin. The project was supported by Lake Champlain Basin Program funding administered through the Department of Environmental Conservation in partnership with the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation. 36Statewide Results of Developed Lands Projects Developed lands projects mitigate erosion and treat polluted stormwater runoff containing nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) and sediment pollution from impervious surfaces. Stormwater treatment practices capture and treat flow from parking lots, sidewalks, and rooftops, while transportation related stormwater projects reduce erosion and mitigate pollutants from road-related sources. The following table summarizes project outputs associated with projects reported through state funding programs and regulatory programs. Regulatory measures are reported through regulatory programs and are not necessarily tied to state funding programs. State and federal funding programs provide funding to support project design and implementation/construction for both regulatory and non-regulatory projects.

REI data come directly from the MRGP database. 37 The segment scoring methodology under the Municipal Roads General Permit was updated in March 2023. More information, including the updated scoring methods, is available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/stormwater/permit-information- applications-fees/municipal-roads-program 38than 120 illicit discharges since SFY 2016. In recent years, these efforts have begun to level out as assessments have covered most areas of the state and the focus has shifted to implementation of identified projects. State-funded non-regulatory stormwater treatment practices have treated over 550 acres of existing impervious surfaces since SFY 2016. Operational stormwater permits require treatment of runoff from new development or redevelopment of a certain size, and have historically not been funded with state dollars.38 However, the Three-Acre Rule will compel many sites with existing impervious surfaces to obtain operational stormwater permits and treat runoff from existing impervious surfaces, known as the Three-Acre General Permit. The state is developing funding programs to support landowners subject to the Three-Acre General Permit requirements. Data on these programs will be reflected in future reports. Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permits require designated urbanized communities to manage stormwater discharges from those areas. MS4 communities can receive partial funding and/or loan financing for the implementation of MS4 projects that address existing untreated or under-treated impervious surface. Since SFY 2016, over 1,000 acres of new and nearly 900 acres of existing impervious surface subject to regulatory requirements under MS4 and operational stormwater permits have been permitted and require treatment to the state standards.39 See Appendix D: Results of State Stormwater Regulations for more information on stormwater permit outputs. To comply with the Municipal Roads General Permit (MRGP), municipalities were required to submit initial Road Erosion Inventories (REIs) by the end of 2020. The number of hydrologically connected (adjacent to or intersecting surface waters) municipal road miles inventoried in each state fiscal year illustrates that permit compliance deadline, with the majority of road miles inventoried between SFY 2017–2021. REIs have covered over 6,000 hydrologically connected municipal road miles as of SFY 2023. Vermont has approximately 6,500 miles of roads that fall under the MRGP’s jurisdiction. Since SFY 2016, the Municipal Roads Grants-in-Aid Program and VTrans Better Roads Program have funded projects resulting in over 360 miles of municipal road drainage and erosion control improvements, and replaced nearly 1,000 municipal road drainage and stream culverts to improve road runoff for water quality. 38 Some of the funding programs established under Act 76 of 2019, described in Appendix A, will provide funding to support regulatory permit compliance under several programs that require treatment of existing impervious surfaces, such as the Three- Acre General Permit. 39 Results associated with regulatory operational stormwater permits are reported at the time of permit obtainment, and permittees have five years to complete the required treatment practice(s) under the permit. 39Figure 19: Phosphorus reduction on developed land is required to implement the Lake Champlain TMDL. This project contributes to that reduction by providing stormwater treatment for untreated developed lands in a Burlington neighborhood via Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI). The image depicts installation of a stormwater infiltration chamber, a GSI technique. Runoff can fill the large yellow structure, then seep slowly into the crushed rock base and soils below. This infrastructure reduces polluted runoff and high stormflows from developed lands that drain into combined sewer systems and contribute to combined sewer overflows. This project was funded through Lake Champlain Basin Program dollars administered by the Department of Environmental Conservation. 40Statewide Results of Wastewater Treatment Projects Wastewater treatment projects decrease the amount of nutrients, like phosphorus and nitrogen, and other pollutants that reach our waterways from municipal wastewater systems through treatment upgrades, combined sewer overflow (CSO) abatement, and refurbishment of aging infrastructure. Clean water projects completed in the wastewater sector are primarily compelled by regulations intended to address point sources of pollution, and some state funding programs provide financial assistance to support regulatory compliance. The following table summarizes project outputs associated with state-funded wastewater treatment projects. Project development measures reflect efforts in the identification, prioritization, and design of projects. Project output measures reflect the impact of project implementation and construction.

Some projects improve treatment within facilities, while others may provide community wastewater solutions to address failed or failing septic systems in designated village centers. State grants and low interest loans capitalized through the Vermont and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) finance municipal wastewater improvements. Wastewater treatment facility upgrades are extremely expensive and are typically only pursued when compelled by a regulatory requirement. Functioning wastewater treatment facilities may require upgrades to expand treatment capacity, which may not be necessary if capacity is sufficient to treat anticipated inflows. Figure 20: One of three wastewater treatment facilities operated by the City of Burlington. The city has partnered with the State of Vermont to finance several municipal wastewater treatment facility improvements and combined sewer overflow abatement projects. Financing this work has been possible in part by the low interest loans available through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. 41 A refurbished wastewater treatment facility refers to a facility with improvements or renovations that enable it to continue to efficiently operate. 42 An upgraded wastewater treatment facility refers to a facility with increased treatment capacity. 42Cost Effectiveness of State Clean Water Investments The previous section of this report summarizes the results of state-funded clean water projects completed from SFY 2016 to SFY 2023. Given the significant costs of restoring and protecting water quality, the state must efficiently and effectively spend its resources. The cost effectiveness of clean water projects is expressed as state dollars invested per kilogram of estimated total phosphorus load reduction over the anticipated lifespan of the project. If projects are maintained beyond their anticipated lifespan, the cost effectiveness of the project improves. Cost effectiveness can only be calculated for project types where estimated total phosphorus load reductions and cost data are available at the project level. Local- and federal-leveraged funds associated with state-funded projects are not included in the calculation of cost effectiveness of state investments. The figure and table below summarize the cost effectiveness of state investments in reducing phosphorus pollution by sector. 43 Transportation Related Natural Resources Stormwater Figure 21: Dollars invested per estimated kilogram of total phosphorus load reduced over the effective lifespan of each project type, based on clean water projects funded through State of Vermont agencies completed in SFY 2016–2023.44 43 Cost effectiveness data is presented in real dollars adjusted to the end of SFY 2023 for comparison purposes. Inflation adjustments were calculated based on the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). 44 Some projects were removed from the analysis due to project costs including work that is not directly associated with phosphorus reductions. 43Table 9: Minimum, median, and maximum cost effectiveness ($/kg of phosphorus reduced) of state investments in clean water projects by project type.

The key is to target funds to the most cost-effective projects within each land use sector. The State of Vermont employs science-based assessments to identify and prioritize projects and incorporates those prioritized actions in Tactical Basin Plans. The figure and table above show the distribution of cost effectiveness across four land use sectors where project level cost and phosphorus reduction data required to calculate cost effectiveness are available. Clean water projects in the agricultural and natural resources sectors included in this analysis are among the most cost-effective practices in terms of dollars invested per unit of estimated phosphorus pollution reduced. In the agricultural sector, practices such as conservation tillage, cover crop, and manure injection are highly cost-effective annual practices, but must be implemented each year to sustain pollution reduction results. Forested riparian buffers are also highly cost-effective, and have a 10 to 20-year lifespan, which results in more sustained phosphorus reduction compared to annual agricultural field and pasture projects. Note that riparian buffers on agricultural lands are included 44under agricultural pollution prevention practices, while buffers planted on all other land uses are considered natural resources restoration projects. The State will account for pollutant reductions in other natural resources projects, such as stream and floodplain restoration, in future years. Stormwater and transportation infrastructure projects tend to be more expensive per unit of estimated phosphorus pollution reduced. Stormwater practices are generally engineered structural practices that can incur high construction costs, but these practices are necessary to achieve required reductions from developed lands and have relatively long lifespans, achieving phosphorus load reductions for 20 years or more, if properly maintained. The large range in the cost effectiveness of road practices may be a result of some municipalities remediating the highest priority, most complex road segments (and therefore most expensive road segments) first to comply with the Municipal Roads General Permit (MRGP). Additionally, road project cost and complexity can vary based on what practices need to be installed to bring a road segment up to MRGP standards. 45Chapter 3: Clean Water Investments and TMDL Progress in the Lake Champlain Basin Lake Champlain TMDL Lake Champlain is one of the largest lakes in North America and its watershed drains nearly half the land area of Vermont, as well as portions of northeastern New York and southern Québec. Phosphorus levels in some portions of Lake Champlain regularly exceed Vermont’s water quality standards, which contributes to cyanobacteria blooms, low dissolved oxygen concentration, impaired aquatic life, and reduced recreational use. The Lake Champlain restoration plan, Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Loads for Vermont Segments of Lake Champlain (Lake Champlain TMDL), identifies phosphorus load reductions that must be achieved in all 12 segments of Lake Champlain to meet State of Vermont water quality standards.45 Total phosphorus loading to Lake Champlain from Vermont was modeled to be 630.6 metric tons per year during the TMDL baseline period of 2001 to 2010. The TMDL states total Figure 22: Lake Champlain TMDL phosphorus loading to the lake must be Accountability Framework schedule by Tactical reduced to 418.1 metric tons per year by the Basin Plan watershed. end of calendar year 2036 to achieve Vermont’s water quality standards, a 212.4 metric ton reduction from the baseline. The Lake Champlain TMDL contains an Accountability Framework intended to ensure adequate progress toward reducing phosphorus pollution to Lake Champlain. The Framework sets a schedule for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue report cards on the State of Vermont’s progress throughout the 20-year implementation timeframe (2016–2036). Tactical Basin Plans are updated on a five-year rotating basis and include Implementation Tables with priority actions to implement the Lake Champlain TMDL. EPA issues interim report cards halfway through the five-year planning cycle and final report cards at the end of the five-year planning cycle based on progress reports produced by DEC (Figure 22).46 EPA uses this chapter of the Clean Water Initiative Annual Performance Report and its appendices to help 45 Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Loads for Vermont Segments of Lake Champlain available at: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/restoring/champlain 46 Additional Lake Champlain TMDL Implementation Progress Report information available at: https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/lake- champlain-phosphorus-tmdl-commitment-clean-water 46determine satisfactory progress for the Lake Champlain TMDL. Progress reports for the 2023 reporting cycle are included in Appendix B: The Northern Lake Champlain Direct Drainages (Basin 5) TMDL Implementation 2023 Progress Report and Appendix C: Winooski River (Basin 8) TMDL Implementation 2023 Progress Report. The following sections of the report summarize the state and federal funding programs’ and regulatory programs’ clean water efforts in the Lake Champlain basin that are contributing to Lake Champlain TMDL progress. Vermont’s Clean Water Investments in the Lake Champlain Basin Reaching Lake Champlain’s water quality goals requires investments across all land use sectors. The following figure summarizes state investment and Lake Champlain Basin Program investments in the Lake Champlain basin from SFY 2016 to 2023. $70 $59.0 million $60 $44.2 million $50 $35.3 million $37.0 million $40 $36.2 million $34.1 million $30 $19.0 million $20 $7.5 million $10 $0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Figure 23: Total dollars awarded by State of Vermont agencies and Lake Champlain Basin Program to clean water projects in the Lake Champlain basin by land use sector, SFY 2016– 2023. Note: Federal funding data administered directly by USDA-NRCS are not included in this figure. Explanation of Figure 23 The State of Vermont and Lake Champlain Basin Program have invested over $272 million in clean water projects in the Lake Champlain basin since SFY 2016. Each year during the reporting period, between 55–70% of state funding for clean water has been directed to projects located within the Lake Champlain basin. The Lake Champlain TMDL sets substantial targets for pollution reduction, and substantial commitment and investment at the state, federal, and local level are needed to achieve Vermont’s water quality goals in the basin.

Estimated Total Phosphorus Load Reductions in Lake Champlain Basin The State of Vermont estimates the pollutant load reductions associated with clean water projects to track progress towards achieving water quality goals. The following figure summarizes the estimated total phosphorus load reductions associated with projects implemented through state and federal funding and regulatory programs in the Lake Champlain basin from SFY 2016 to 2023 by sector. 50 45.0 42.7 41.5 40 33.2 30 27.5 21.4 19.0 20 12.9 10 0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Figure 24: Annual estimated total phosphorus load reductions (metric tons per year) associated with projects implemented through state and federal funding and regulatory programs in the Lake Champlain basin in effect during SFY 2016–2023 by land use sector.47 Explanation of Figure 24 State funding programs, federal funding programs, and regulatory programs in the Lake Champlain basin resulted in projects that reduced an estimated 41.5 metric tons of phosphorus as of the close of SFY 2023. The State acknowledges some of the phosphorus reduction gains reported for SFY 2022 have not continued in SFY 2023. Implementation of the TMDL is not a linear path. Changing rates of progress over the 20- year implementation timeframe are to be expected and are associated with swings in 47 Annual phosphorus load reductions are cumulative for all completed/operational projects based on start date and anticipated lifespan. Results of USDA-NRCS funded projects completed since SFY 2010 that are still in effect SFY 2016–2023 are included to represent progress since the Lake Champlain TMDL baseline period. 48 noitcudeR daoL surohpsohP latoT detamitsE nisaB nialpmahC ekaL eht ni )raeY/snoT cirteM( Click symbol to view description of accountability measures. State Fiscal Year (SFY) Agriculture Natural Resources Stormwater Transportation Related Stormwaterfinancial assistance levels, and the capacity of agencies and partners to administer funds, implement projects, and report outcomes. The following paragraphs provide some context to explain TMDL implementation progress by sector. The estimated phosphorus reductions achieved to date in the agricultural sector are mostly from annual field practices, such as cover crops, reduced- or no-till, and manure injection. Most of the phosphorus reductions required in the agricultural sector are tied to croplands, meaning that annual field practices are necessary to implement the TMDL. Annual practices must be implemented every year to sustain phosphorus reductions. Implementation of annual practices is dependent on land management decisions that can be influenced by a variety of farm business factors. This year, the data suggest a slight slowdown in phosphorus reductions associated with annual practices. This is likely the result of a combination of factors, including: • Some practices can only be implemented for a limited number of years to be eligible for cost share. Many programs are also subject to funding caps, which may limit the reported acres of practice implementation. • Many farms implement agricultural conservation practices without the support of cost share programs. The State is limited in its ability to capture the water quality benefits of practices implemented outside cost share programs, and only some of these data are presented in this report. • The multi-year federal Farm Bill governs much of the funding available to support agricultural practice implementation. Funds are often limited near the end of a Farm Bill cycle. The most recent Farm Bill was passed in 2018 and is set to expire at the end of calendar year 2023. • Agricultural water quality programs have recently expanded in focus and emphasis to include holistic planning and implementation on farms, the results of which may not be fully reflected in available data. In the natural resources sector, the increase in previously reported phosphorus reductions across all state fiscal years is largely attributable to incorporation of new phosphorus reduction accounting methods to capture the water quality benefits associated with the State of Vermont’s Use Value Appraisal (UVA) Program on forestland parcels.48 Forestland parcels that are actively enrolled in the UVA Program and have been inspected for program compliance meet Vermont’s Acceptable Management Practices (AMPs), a set of forestland management criteria designed to maintain and protect water quality.49 Newly established phosphorus accounting methods for other practices in the natural resources sector are in the process of being implemented, and will be reflected in future years of reporting. These new methods will be applied to newly completed projects, as well as applied to fill gaps for previously completed projects as data availability allows. Estimated phosphorus reductions in the stormwater and transportation related stormwater land use sectors have been incrementally growing. This progress is associated with increased implementation of several regulatory programs designed to 48 For details on phosphorus accounting for UVA parcels, please see the Standard Operating Procedures for Tracking & Accounting of Natural Resources Restoration Projects: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/cwi/projects/tracking- accounting#SOP 49 Phosphorus reductions are only accounting for forestland parcels that enrolled in the UVA program after the TMDL baseline periods. 49reduce and mitigate stormwater pollution from developed lands and roads. Operational stormwater permits regulate stormwater discharges resulting from new development, redevelopment, and three-acre sites. Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permits regulate stormwater discharges in the most populous regions of the state. The Municipal Roads General Permit (MRGP) regulates stormwater related erosion on municipally owned roads. Regulatory programs are at varying stages of implementation, and continued expansion of compliance will increase estimated phosphorus reductions in future years.50 In the Lake Champlain basin, the change in pace of estimated annual phosphorus reduction progress seen in the data available for SFY 2022 and 2023 may be in part a reflection of the completion of relatively easy to implement projects. Now that many of the low-hanging projects have largely been implemented, identification and implementation of projects that are in some cases more complex and involved, will need to be completed to reach Vermont’s water quality goals in the basin. The variability of implementation rates across years also underscores the importance of investing in program and partner capacity to broaden the reach and impact of clean water project implementation. 50 For more information on regulatory stormwater programs in Vermont, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/stormwater/permit-information-applications-fees 50Lake Champlain TMDL Progress Total phosphorus loading from Vermont to Lake Champlain was modeled to be 630.6 metric tons per year during the Lake Champlain TMDL baseline period of 2001 to 2010. The TMDL states net phosphorus loading to Lake Champlain must be reduced by 212.4 metric tons per year to reach a target load of 418.1 metric tons per year by the end of calendar year 2036 to achieve Vermont’s water quality standards. The following figure summarizes the steady progress that has been made towards achieving the Lake Champlain TMDL since SFY 2016. 700 6% 9% 10% 13% 600 16% 20% 21% 20% 500 400 300 200 100 0 Figure 25: Estimated total phosphorus load reductions in effect during SFY 2016–2023 relative to the Lake Champlain TMDL total phosphorus baseline and target total phosphorus load in metric tons per year. Explanation of Figure 25 The progress made toward reaching Lake Champlain’s phosphorus reduction target has increased since SFY 2016, however progress has slowed in recent years (see explanation of Figure 24 for more context on rate of progress). State, federal, and regulatory clean water programs have reduced an estimated 41.5 metric tons of phosphorus loading delivered to Lake Champlain in SFY 2023, which represents approximately 20 percent of the required reduction. This result is expected to increase in the coming years for at least the following reasons: 1. An influx in federal funding under ARPA, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act, increased Clean Water Fund revenue enacted under Act 76 of 2019, and investment in the capacity of clean water partners will drive project 51 )raeY/snoT cirteM( daoL surohpsohP latoT Click symbol to view description of accountability measures.

The State of Vermont has been building and expanding clean water regulatory, financial, and technical assistance programs since SFY 2016. Many regulatory programs are now in place that will drive phosphorus reductions from agricultural and developed lands. In some cases, the results of these regulatory programs have yet to be reflected in project-level reported data. For example, under the Three-Acre General Permit, landowners are in the process of obtaining permit coverage near term, and construction of appropriate treatment is required within five years of permit authorization. 3. The State has published methods for quantifying phosphorus reductions for agricultural, natural resources, and developed lands sector clean water practices. New methods were recently established to fill gaps in capturing the phosphorus reduction benefit of several practices, particularly in the natural resources sector. These new methods are in the process of being implemented and will be reflected in future years of reporting for newly completed projects, as well as applied to fill gaps for prior completed projects. Lake Champlain TMDL Progress by Lake Segment Watershed The Lake Champlain TMDL allocates total phosphorus load reduction targets by lake segment watershed, which differ slightly from the boundaries of Tactical Planning Basins. The following figure presents estimated total phosphorus load reductions in effect in SFY 2023 by lake segment watershed compared to the target reduction established by the TMDL.

Lake segment size and level of phosphorus reduction required varies: The TMDL allocated phosphorus loading capacity based on each lake segment’s land use and in-lake characteristics and the reduction required to meet Vermont water quality standards. The level of effort required and the magnitude of phosphorus loading ranges by lake segment. 2. Clean water projects are targeted in priority watersheds: Tactical Basin Plans inform where to prioritize efforts for reducing phosphorus loading to Lake Champlain. The level of progress in the Northeast Arm and St. Albans Bay lake segments is relatively high, as USDA-NRCS has targeted significant agricultural technical and financial assistance to these watersheds. 3. New phosphorus reduction methodology: The State has published methods for quantifying phosphorus reductions for agricultural, natural resources, and developed lands sector clean water practices. Lake segments dominated by agricultural efforts show greater progress than lake segments targeting natural resources restoration because there are currently more comprehensive systems to quantify estimated reductions for agricultural projects compared to other sectors. 52 To view a map of the lake segment watersheds, see page 3 of the Lake Champlain TMDL, available at: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/restoring/champlain 53Monitored Total Phosphorus Load from Vermont Wastewater Treatment Facilities in the Lake Champlain Basin The phosphorus load allocations in the Lake Champlain TMDL are separated into wastewater wasteload allocations and non-wastewater load allocations. Tracking progress towards reaching the non-wastewater load allocation target is reflected in the previous TMDL progress figures. The wastewater wasteload allocation is tracked through measured water quality of effluent from the wastewater treatment facilities located within the Lake Champlain basin. The following figure shows the target wastewater wasteload allocation since the 2002 Lake Champlain TMDL and the measured total phosphorus from wastewater treatment facilities each year. 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Figure 27: Measured total phosphorus load (metric tons per year) from Vermont wastewater treatment facilities draining to Lake Champlain and the Lake Champlain TMDL wastewater treatment facility wasteload allocation, calendar year 1995–2022.53 Explanation of Figure 27 Total average annual phosphorus loading into Lake Champlain originating from Vermont wastewater treatment facilities was approximately 24.6 metric tons per year during the Lake Champlain TMDL baseline period of 2001–2010, representing approximately four percent of total phosphorus loading to Lake Champlain from Vermont sources. During the baseline period, measured total annual phosphorus loading from wastewater treatment facilities was well below the wasteload allocation (maximum permitted phosphorus limit) of 55.8 metric tons that was established under the 2002 Lake Champlain TMDL. The updated 2016 Lake Champlain TMDL for Vermont reduced the wastewater treatment facility wasteload allocation from 55.8 to 32.3 metric tons, which is intended to achieve the overall required phosphorus load allocation while allowing for some development and growth over the TMDL implementation timeframe. Discharge monitoring indicates 53 Total measured phosphorus load does not include loading associated with combined sewer overflow (CSO) events. Untreated CSO flows contribute an extremely small proportion of total phosphorus loading to lakes in Vermont. 54 surohpsohP latoT )raeY/snoT cirteM( 5991 6991 7991 8991 9991 0002 1002 2002 3002 4002 5002 6002 7002 8002 9002 0102 1102 2102 3102 4102 5102 6102 7102 8102 9102 0202 1202 2202 2002TMDL 2016 TMDL Total Measured Phosphorus Load TMDL Wastewater Treatment Facility Wasteload AllocationVermont wastewater treatment facilities in the Lake Champlain basin contributed approximately 10.9 metric tons of total phosphorus load to Lake Champlain in calendar year 2022, representing only 34 percent of the total wastewater treatment facility wasteload allocation under the current TMDL. These data demonstrate a consistent trend of measured total annual phosphorus load from Vermont wastewater treatment facilities, overall, well below the wasteload allocation. 55Chapter 4: Clean Water Investments and TMDL Progress in the Lake Memphremagog Basin Lake Memphremagog TMDL Lake Memphremagog is an international waterbody with the majority of its watershed area in Vermont and a small portion in Québec. The Vermont portion of the watershed covers most of Orleans County including the three major lake tributaries: the Black, Barton, and Clyde Rivers, as well as the smaller Johns River. The Lake Memphremagog watershed is part of the larger Tactical Basin Planning region (Basin 17), which also includes the Tomifobia and Coaticook River basins that drain into Québec (Figure 28). Land use within the Vermont portion of the Lake Memphremagog watershed is largely forest or shrub with about 17 percent in agriculture, and five percent in developed lands.54 Phosphorus levels in the Vermont portion of Lake Memphremagog are higher than the water quality standard set for the lake. Elevated levels of phosphorus contribute to intermittent cyanobacteria blooms but also support excessive plant and algae growth that limits the quality of the lake for recreational use. The Lake Memphremagog TMDL was established in 2017 to specify the maximum amount of Figure 28: Map of Vermont phosphorus that the waterbody can receive and still meet with the Lake applicable water quality standards and establish targets for Memphremagog, Tomifobia, reducing phosphorus loading to the lake from its watershed. and Coaticook Rivers Total phosphorus loading to Lake Memphremagog from Vermont Tactical Basin Planning was modeled to be 52.7 metric tons per year during the TMDL region (Basin 17) highlighted baseline period of 2009 to 2012. The TMDL states total in green. phosphorus loading to Lake Memphremagog must be reduced by 29 percent to 37.4 metric tons per year by 2037 to achieve Vermont’s water quality standards.55 Tactical Basin Planning is integral to identifying priority projects to achieve water quality goals. The Lake Memphremagog, Tomifobia, and Coaticook Tactical Basin Plan (Basin 17) was updated in 2023.

Explanation of Figure 29 The State of Vermont has invested over $20 million in the Lake Memphremagog, Tomifobia, and Coaticook basin since SFY 2016. From SFY 2016 to 2020, the greatest investments in the basin occurred in the developed lands and agriculture sectors. There was a large increase in natural resources funding in SFY 2021 due to the conservation of 129 acres of waterfront land at Bluffside Farm on Lake Memphremagog in Newport. This $1.4 million project was funded by a Clean Water State Revolving Fund Land Conservation Interim Financing Loan provided to Vermont Land Trust. This interim financing program provides partners with upfront access to capital to act on time- 57 Funding presented in this chapter is representative of clean water project work across the entire Lake Memphremagog, Tomifobia, and Coaticook Rivers Tactical Planning Basin.

In SFY 2022 and 2023, the increase in cross sector funding is largely a result of funding awarded to the Clean Water Service Provider in the Lake Memphremagog basin. The large influx in state funding awarded to the wastewater sector in SFY 2023 includes over $1.7 million dollars awarded through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to support the construction phase of a wastewater treatment facility refurbishment project serving Derby Line and located in Standstead, Québec. Estimated Total Phosphorus Load Reductions in Lake Memphremagog Basin The State of Vermont estimates the pollutant load reductions associated with clean water projects to track progress towards achieving water quality goals.

State Fiscal Year (SFY) Agriculture Natural Resources Stormwater Transportation Related Stormwaternearly twenty-fold from SFY 2016 to 2023. In recent reporting years, the pace of estimated phosphorus reduction progress has slowed. Changing rates of progress over the 20-year implementation timeframe are to be expected and are associated with swings in financial assistance levels, as well as the capacity of agencies and partners to administer funds, implement projects, and report outcomes. The following paragraphs provide some context to explain estimated phosphorus reductions reported by sector to date. The estimated phosphorus reductions in the agricultural sector are largely from the implementation of annual field practices, such as cover crops, reduced- or no-till, and manure injection. Most of the phosphorus reductions required in the agricultural sector are tied to croplands, meaning that annual field practices are necessary to implement the TMDL. Annual practices must be implemented every year to sustain phosphorus reductions. Implementation of annual practices is dependent on land management decisions that can be influenced by a variety of farm business factors. This year, the data suggest a slight slowdown in phosphorus reductions associated with annual practices. This is likely the result of a combination of factors, including: • Some practices can only be implemented for a limited number of years to be eligible for cost share. Many programs are also subject to funding caps, which may limit the reported acres of practice implementation. • Many farms implement agricultural conservation practices without the support of cost share programs. The State is limited in its ability to capture the water quality benefits of practices implemented outside of cost share programs, and only some of these data are presented in this report. • The multi-year federal Farm Bill governs much of the funding available to support agricultural practice implementation. Funds are often limited near the end of a Farm Bill cycle. The most recent Farm Bill was passed in 2018 and is set to expire at the end of calendar year 2023. • Agricultural water quality programs have recently expanded in focus and emphasis to include holistic planning and implementation on farms, the results of which may not be fully reflected in available data. In the natural resources sector, the increase in previously reported phosphorus reductions across all state fiscal years is largely attributable to incorporation of new phosphorus reduction accounting methods to capture the water quality benefits associated with the State of Vermont’s Use Value Appraisal (UVA) Program on forestland parcels.60 Forestland parcels that are actively enrolled in the UVA Program and have been inspected for program compliance meet Vermont’s Acceptable Management Practices (AMPs), a set of forestland management criteria designed to maintain and protect water quality.61 Newly established phosphorus accounting methods for other practices in the natural resources sector are in the process of being implemented, and will be reflected in future years of reporting. These new methods will be applied to newly 60 For details on phosphorus accounting for UVA parcels, please see the Standard Operating Procedures for Tracking & Accounting of Natural Resources Restoration Projects: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/cwi/projects/tracking- accounting#SOP 61 Phosphorus reductions are only accounting for forestland parcels that enrolled in the UVA program after the TMDL baseline periods. 59completed projects, as well as applied to fill gaps for previously completed projects as data availability allows. Estimated phosphorus reductions in the stormwater and transportation related stormwater land use sectors are contributing an increasing proportion of total estimated phosphorus reductions in recent years. This progress can be attributed to increased implementation of several regulatory programs designed to reduce and mitigate stormwater pollution from developed lands and roads. In the stormwater sector, operational stormwater permits regulate stormwater discharges caused by new development, redevelopment, and three-acre sites. In the transportation related stormwater sector, the Municipal Roads General Permit (MRGP) regulates stormwater related erosion on municipally owned roads. Regulatory programs are at varying stages of implementation, and continued expansion of compliance will increase estimated phosphorus reductions in future years.62 In the Lake Memphremagog basin, it is likely that the slowing trend of estimated annual phosphorus reduction progress is in part a reflection of early adoption of easy to implement, ready to construct projects. As implementation of the TMDL continues, identification and implementation of additional projects, including in some cases more complex and involved projects, will need to be completed to continue working towards reaching Vermont’s water quality goals in the basin. The variability of implementation rates across years also underscores the importance of investing in program and partner capacity to broaden the reach and impact of clean water project implementation. 62 For more information on regulatory stormwater programs in Vermont, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/stormwater/permit-information-applications-fees 60Lake Memphremagog TMDL Progress The Lake Memphremagog TMDL states net phosphorus loading to Lake Memphremagog must be reduced from 52.7 metric tons per year to 37.4 metric tons per year by the end of calendar year 2037 to achieve Vermont’s water quality standards.

Phosphorus reductions are expected to increase in the coming years for at least the following reasons: 1. An influx in federal funding under ARPA, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act, increased Clean Water Fund revenue enacted under Act 76 of 2019, and investment in the capacity of clean water partners will drive project implementation across sectors.63 While many of these funding programs and capacity initiatives are underway, the results of these investments will not be fully 63 For more information on the Clean Water Budget, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/cwi/board 61 )raeY/snoT cirteM( daoL surohpsohP latoT Click symbol to view description of accountability measures.

The State of Vermont has been building and expanding clean water regulatory, financial, and technical assistance programs since SFY 2016. Many regulatory programs are now in place that will drive phosphorus reductions from agricultural and developed lands. In some cases, the results of these regulatory programs have yet to be reflected in project-level reported data. For example, under the Three-Acre General Permit, landowners are in the process of obtaining permit coverage near term, and construction of appropriate treatment is required within five years of permit authorization. 3. The State has published methods for quantifying phosphorus reductions for agricultural, natural resources, and developed lands sector clean water practices. New methods were recently established to fill gaps in capturing the phosphorus reduction benefit of several practices, particularly in the natural resources sector. These new methods are in the process of being implemented and will be reflected in future years of reporting for newly completed projects as well as applied to fill gaps for prior completed projects. 62Monitored Total Phosphorus Load from Vermont Wastewater Treatment Facilities in the Lake Memphremagog Basin The phosphorus load allocations in the Lake Memphremagog TMDL are separated into wastewater wasteload and non-wastewater load allocations. Tracking progress towards reaching the non-wastewater load allocation target is reflected in the previous TMDL progress figures. The wastewater wasteload allocation is tracked through measured water quality of effluent from the wastewater treatment facilities located within the Lake Memphremagog basin. The following figure shows the target wastewater wasteload allocation for the Lake Memphremagog TMDL and the measured total phosphorus from wastewater treatment facilities each year. 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Figure 32: Measured total phosphorus load (metric tons per year) from Vermont wastewater treatment facilities draining to Lake Memphremagog and the permitted wasteload of wastewater treatment facilities in the Lake Memphremagog Basin, calendar year 2006–2022. Explanation of Figure 32 The total average annual phosphorus loading into Lake Memphremagog originating from Vermont wastewater treatment facilities was approximately 3.1 metric tons per year during the Lake Memphremagog TMDL baseline period of 2009–2012, representing approximately four percent of total phosphorus loading to Lake Memphremagog from Vermont sources. During the baseline period, measured total annual phosphorus loading from wastewater treatment facilities was well below the permitted phosphorus limit of 3.1 metric tons. The 2017 Lake Memphremagog TMDL for Vermont reduced the wastewater treatment facility permitted wasteload to 2.08 metric tons, which is intended to achieve the overall required phosphorus load allocation while allowing for some development and growth over the TMDL implementation timeframe. Discharge monitoring indicates Vermont wastewater treatment facilities in the Lake Memphremagog basin contributed approximately 0.49 metric tons of total phosphorus load to Lake Memphremagog in calendar year 2022, representing only 23 percent of the permitted wasteload under the current TMDL. These data demonstrate a consistent trend of measured total annual phosphorus load from Vermont wastewater treatment facilities, overall, well below the wasteload allocation. 63 surohpsohP latoT )raeY/snoT cirteM( 2017 TMDL Total Measured Phosphorus Load TMDL Wastewater Treatment Facility Wasteload AllocationChapter 5: Connecticut River Basin Clean Water Investments and Results Long Island Sound TMDL The Connecticut River is New England’s longest river. It runs through four states: Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. Seven Tactical Planning Basins in the eastern half of the State of Vermont drain to the Connecticut River, which eventually drains to the Long Island Sound. The Long Island Sound is a large estuary that drains a total watershed of over 16,000 square miles, including the Connecticut River as well as areas of Rhode Island and New York according to the Long Island Sound TMDL (Figure 33).64 The Long Island Sound is impaired due to nitrogen, which can cause cyanobacteria blooms and hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column) leading to “dead zones” that threaten marine life. To address the excess nitrogen and resulting hypoxia, the EPA approved A Total Maximum Daily Load Analysis to Achieve Water Quality Standards for Dissolved Oxygen in Long Island Sound in 2001 to define the nitrogen reductions necessary to meet water quality standards in the Sound. Vermont's clean water efforts to restore, protect, and enhance water quality in the Connecticut River and its tributaries are also contributing to water quality progress for Figure 33: Map of the Long Island Long Island Sound. The following section of the report Sound watershed. summarizes state investments in clean water efforts in the Credit: New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission.

Currently, there are no methods in place to estimate total nitrogen load reductions to the Connecticut River basin, but these are planned to be established in the coming years. 64 A Total Maximum Daily Load Analysis to Achieve Water Quality Standards for Dissolved Oxygen in Long Island Sound can be accessed here: http://longislandsoundstudy.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Tmdl.pdf http://longislandsoundstudy.net/wp- content/uploads/2010/03/Tmdl.pdf 64Vermont’s Clean Water Investments in the Connecticut River Basin Reaching the Connecticut River basin’s water quality goals requires investments across all land use sectors.

Explanation of Figure 34 The State of Vermont has invested nearly $116 million in clean water projects in the Connecticut River basin since SFY 2016. Clean water funding in the Connecticut River basin varies from year-to-year based on project readiness and funding award rounds. Wastewater investments in SFY 2018, 2022, and 2023 included several construction phase wastewater treatment facility refurbishments and combined sewer overflow (CSO) abatement projects funded primarily through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) financing and Capital Bill funds. The large increase in natural resources funding in SFY 2020 is in part reflective of a $4 million investment to conserve forestland located in the towns of Chittenden, Mendon, and Killington funded by a CWSRF Land Conservation Interim Financing Loan. This interim financing program provides partners with upfront access to capital to act on time-sensitive conservation opportunities and affords partners time to secure funds to repay the loan over the course of five years. 65 sralloD fo snoilliM Click symbol to view description of accountability measures. State Fiscal Year (SFY) Agriculture Natural Resources Cross Sector Stormwater Transportation Related Stormwater WastewaterFuture Total Nitrogen Load Reduction Tracking Nitrogen reduction estimates cannot be reported for the Connecticut River basin, as the State of Vermont does not yet have baseline nitrogen loading rates or nitrogen reduction efficiencies for clean water projects in the Connecticut River basin. EPA-supported efforts are underway to develop consistent methods for all five states covered under the Long Island Sound TMDL to estimate nitrogen reductions for clean water projects. Vermont will set a schedule to publish methods to account for nitrogen reductions in the Connecticut River basin to comply with Vermont’s Clean Water Service Delivery Act, Act 76 of 2019 (10 V.S.A. § 923) and to align with ongoing five state nitrogen tracking coordination efforts. 66Chapter 6: Context and Takeaways Water pollutants that enter Vermont’s waters, including nutrient and sediment pollution, can lead to local and regional water quality issues. Excess phosphorus loading can result in potentially harmful cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Champlain, Lake Memphremagog, and inland lakes around the state. Excess nitrogen loading contributes to low dissolved oxygen and dead zones in the Long Island Sound. Most sources of water pollution in Vermont are from nonpoint sources where rainfall and snowmelt carry pollution from the land surface into waterways. Due to the dispersed nature of nonpoint source pollution, realizing our water quality goals requires actions of various scales across all land uses to mitigate water pollution. The dispersed nature of pollution sources from the landscape also means that many external landscape-scale factors can affect the rate of progress. The success of this work also depends on the willingness of the public to adopt clean water projects and a well-supported, diverse network of partners to develop and implement projects. The following sections provide important context for interpreting results summarized in this report and the outlook for clean water progress in Vermont. Modeled vs. Measured The State of Vermont estimates pollutant reductions associated with clean water projects. Estimates are currently available for phosphorus reductions for projects located in the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog basins, summarized in Chapters 3 and 4 of this report. These modeled estimates provide an incremental measure of progress at the project-level, however, many landscape-level factors influence on-the-ground water quality conditions. Measured water quality through monitoring is the ultimate indicator of clean water progress— whether the goal is protection of high-quality waters or the restoration of impaired waters. The State of Vermont monitors water quality to assess the status and trends of its surface waters, posts data online, and reports the status of Vermont’s waters on a biennial basis.65 The State of Vermont also supports local monitoring initiatives through its LaRosa Partnership Program and participates in the Lake Champlain Basin Program’s Long Term Monitoring Project to monitor the water quality conditions of Lake Champlain, including the status and trends of phosphorus loading.66,67 Monitoring data and water quality status and trends are integrated into State of Vermont Tactical Basin Plans, which inform clean water funding and project implementation strategies. Tactical Basin Plans employ an adaptive management approach by considering measures of clean water project progress, water quality status and trends, and changes in land use conditions impacting water quality. Factors Influencing Water Quality Progress The state and federal funding programs and regulatory programs summarized in this report are designed to restore, enhance, and protect water quality, but there are many landscape-scale 65 Visit the Department of Environmental Conservation’s Monitoring and Assessment webpage for more information, available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/map 66 Visit the LaRosa Partnership Program webpage for more information, available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/map/monitor/larosa 67 Visit the Lake Champlain Long Term Monitoring Project webpage for more information, available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/lakes-ponds/monitor/lake-champlain 67factors beyond our control that influence progress in reaching our water quality goals. Climate change and historical pollution are two primary challenges influencing water quality progress. In addition to landscape-level factors, the success of our clean water efforts depends on the capacity of Vermont’s clean water workforce to develop, implement, and maintain projects. The following sections explain how these factors influence the outputs and outcomes summarized in this report. Climate Change Climate change’s impact on temperature and precipitation patterns affects water quality. This underscores the importance of continued assessment of water quality progress through monitoring data and consideration for external factors that may be impacting measured outcomes. Data for the past several decades show long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation, and the risks of severe weather in Vermont.68 As climate change continues, it is important to understand the impacts on Vermont and its waters — namely climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of storms and flooding events and increasing air and water temperatures. Above average pollutant loads resulting from flood events and high temperatures can also increase the incidence and severity of cyanobacteria blooms. Climate Change and Cyanobacteria Blooms Climate change is predicted to affect several key factors that regulate cyanobacteria growth — temperature, nutrient availability, and water stability. Warmer summer temperatures and shorter, warmer winters will increase the length of time that cyanobacteria can proliferate each year. The cyanobacteria monitoring program on Lake Champlain since 2003 has documented that blooms are occurring earlier in the summer and persisting later into the fall. The monitoring season now begins about two weeks earlier than it did in 2003 and recent data show blooms occurring into mid-October. Scientists in Vermont and elsewhere are noting the incidence of cyanobacteria blooms at lower than expected phosphorus concentrations, indicating that the factors noted above may contribute to the incidence of bloom condition. The State of Vermont will have little control over global factors that drive climate change-related weather patterns and precipitation. Therefore, Vermont will need to continue its focus on land-use management and control of nutrient pollution loading to surface waters to reduce the impact of cyanobacteria blooms. Climate Change and Increased Precipitation Climate data indicate statistically significant increase in frequency of intense storms and annual total precipitation since 1940. Water quality monitoring shows that storm events often correlate with peaks in sediment and nutrient loading to lakes. For example, phosphorus readily binds to soil, and when soil erodes into our waters, it carries phosphorus with it. Change in precipitation patterns may increase water pollution by increasing: • Erosion of unstable road networks; • Erosion and hazards of unstable river and streambanks; • Erosion of lakeshores; • Volume of runoff from agricultural fields and production areas; 68 Vermont Climate Action Office (CAO) website: https://climatechange.vermont.gov/ 68• Volume of stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces, such as roads, parking lots, and rooftops; and • Incidents of combined sewer overflows. The summer 2023 flood events demonstrated the harms of climate-driven increased precipitation on Vermont’s communities and environment. Heavy, prolonged rainfall resulted in major flooding statewide. Three to nine inches of rainfall was observed across the state over a 48-hour period in July.69 Streams and rivers rose quickly — high waters and flood hazards led to displacement of people, infrastructure failure, property damage, crop loss, and peaks in water pollution. High flow events like this deliver significant amounts of sediment and other pollutants to waterways.70 In the hours and days following a severe flooding event, temporary reductions in water quality and high measurements of sediment and phosphorus in waters are expected. Longer term, this type of event delivers large amounts of phosphorus laden sediments, which settle to the lake bottom and can contribute to internal phosphorus loading in subsequent years. Climate-driven changes in precipitation patterns highlight the importance of climate adaptation and flood resilience. Clean water projects support climate adaptation and flood resilience in many ways, including projects that: • Protect and restore natural resources, such as wetlands, floodplains, and lakeshores, to slow down, spread out, and soak up floodwaters; • Implement agricultural field practices to improve soil health, water infiltration, and carbon sequestration; • Manage large forestland blocks to protect biodiversity, sequester carbon, and mitigate flood related erosion; • Use updated road, bridge, and culvert design standards that are able to withstand higher river and stream flows and more intense storms; • Implement Stormwater Management Manual standards to emphasize the importance of infiltrating stormwater runoff from developed lands into soils; and • Invest in wastewater infrastructure improvements to reduce flood related damage and limit the occurrence and severity of combined sewer overflow events. It is important to consider climate change’s impact on Vermont’s clean water work when evaluating progress. Uncertainty in how climate change will influence pollution delivered to waterways is incorporated into pollution reduction targets articulated in large-scale nutrient TMDLs.71 There are reasons to be hopeful that Vermont can meet its water quality goals despite climate change with sustained effort and investment. The more clean water projects implemented, the more resilient our waterways will be to extreme weather events and floods, which also protects Vermont’s communities and built infrastructure from flood hazards. Realizing our water quality goals requires sustained investment and will continue to yield multiple benefits, including climate adaptation and flood resilience. 69 National Weather Service: https://www.weather.gov/btv/The-Great-Vermont-Flood-of-10-11-July-2023-Preliminary- Meteorological-Summary 70 Lake Champlain Basin Program: https://www.lcbp.org/our-goals/thriving-communities/flooding/2023-flooding/ 71 The Lake Champlain TMDL model simulated climate change scenarios and added a five percent margin of safety to each lake segment’s loading capacity to address the likely increases in phosphorus loading from climate change, while the Lake Memphremagog model added an eight percent margin of safety. 69Legacy (Historical) Pollution Sources Clean water investments primarily address external loading, which is pollution originating from the land surface, to minimize the volume of nutrients and sediment deposited into adjacent waterways. Sediments and nutrients like phosphorus tend to accumulate at the bottom of lakes. When phosphorus in lakebed sediments moves into the water column, it is called internal loading.72 Vermont’s long history of logging and agriculture as two dominant land management approaches have resulted in a build-up of legacy phosphorus in lake systems that contributes to internal loading. As a result, in some lakes, a substantial lag time between the implementation of clean water projects and the realization of measurable water quality improvements is expected. This highlights the importance of sustained efforts to minimize additional nutrient and sediment pollution to ensure long term health of Vermont’s waters. In some cases, addressing internal loading from legacy phosphorus concentrations may be needed in combination with continued work to mitigate external loading to achieve desired water quality outcomes and reduce the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms. Vermont’s Clean Water Workforce Vermont’s work to improve water quality is led by and relies upon a network of partner organizations and project implementers who: • Participate in clean water project planning and identification efforts; • Host clean water projects on their property; • Provide and/or administer clean water funding; • Complete clean water project work, including development, design, implementation, and maintenance; and • Report back to the state on the outcomes of projects. 72 James, W.

The success of the Clean Water Initiative and clean water projects across land use sectors requires the network of partners to be numerous, diverse, well-trained, and well-resourced. For many years, the Lake Champlain Basin Program and the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets have invested in partner capacity focused on the clean water network, although the focus has been limited geographically, or to the agricultural sector. In 2023, the Agency of Natural Resources joined this effort by launching its own Clean Water Workforce Capacity Development Initiative. The results and impacts of these collective investments in capacity development will be reflected in future years of this report. Outlook for Reaching Vermont’s Water Quality Goals Continued effort, investment, capacity building, and coordination are critical to the state reaching its water quality goals. The state is making a substantial investment in clean water projects that yield many additional benefits, including flood resilience and climate adaptation. Maintaining the 71level of clean water investment and regulation is critical to reach our water quality goals, as it will take time for impaired waterways to recover after decades of excess pollution. Trends in reported outputs and outcomes are expected to increase in the coming years for the following reasons: • State funding programs at DEC have shifted to block grant structures that rely on regional partners to manage and administer funding of individual projects. The transition to regional administration of clean water funding is anticipated to empower community partners, reduce bottlenecks, and increase the impact of clean water investments. • Vermont has received an influx in federal funding under ARPA, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as increased Clean Water Fund revenue enacted under Act 76 of 2019. Program expansion supported by this funding will drive clean water project implementation across sectors. • The State of Vermont has been expanding clean water regulatory, financial, and technical assistance programs since SFY 2016. Many regulatory programs are now in place that will drive meaningful progress in the agriculture and developed lands sectors. • Throughout this report, there are areas where capacity constraints are resulting in lags in clean water investments, project work, and reported results. Indirect investments in network capacity are expected to mitigate some of these lag times and increase the rate of progress. • The State is expanding its ability to fully capture results in its tracking and reporting, such as estimating phosphorus reductions for additional project types in the natural resources sector. Enhanced tracking and reporting will provide a more complete picture of progress on the ground. This report serves as a useful tool to provide accountability on the state’s clean water progress and to inform adaptive management. By taking an adaptive management approach, the state will continue to identify and prioritize its resources to break down barriers to project implementation and clean water progress. Clean water project implementation is an important piece of climate resilience work and clean water projects have co-benefits like increased flood resilience, improved carbon sequestration, better soil health, and improved habitat function and biodiversity. In addition to achieving water quality goals, Vermont’s work to improve water quality directly supports climate adaptation and flood mitigation, which will increase the state’s resilience to future climate related stressors. 72Appendix A: Act 76 of 2019 Vermont’s Clean Water Service Delivery Act Act 76 of 2019 established a water quality project delivery framework to support Vermont’s clean water goals and secured a new long-term funding source for the Clean Water Fund. Act 76 established four complementary grant programs intended to support implementation of the Clean Water Initiative by addressing sources of pollution through both regulatory and non- regulatory mechanisms: Water Quality Restoration Formula Grants, Water Quality Enhancement Grants, Municipal Stormwater Implementation Grants, and Developed Lands Implementation Grants.73 Act 76 also continues support for other Clean Water Fund priorities, such as Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets’ water quality grants to partners and farmers. The grant programs created under Act 76 began in state fiscal year (SFY) 2023 and funding associated with these programs is integrated into the statewide funding totals presented in Chapter 2. Annual funding levels for all four grant programs established under Act 76 are set by the Clean Water Board through the annual Clean Water Budget development process.74 The following sections summarize the administration of these funding programs. Data are being collected on the funding and outcomes of these grant programs to assess adequacy of funding levels. Currently, these grant programs are adequately funding the implementation of the Clean Water Initiative factoring the recent influx of federal funds and capacity available in the network to implement this work. No change is recommended at this time to the Water Quality Enhancement Grants funding limit. The State will continue to assess the adequacy of funding and report an annual recommendation. Water Quality Restoration Formula Grant Program Act 76 established regional organizations called Clean Water Service Providers (CWSPs) for each Tactical Planning Basin in the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog basins. CWSPs are responsible for partnering with Basin Water Quality Councils and project implementers to oversee the identification, funding, implementation, operation, and maintenance of non-regulatory clean water projects to meet non-regulatory phosphorus reduction targets with funding provided through the Water Quality Restoration Formula Grant Program. Water Quality Restoration Formula Grants are awarded annually to each CWSP. Formula Grants funds are allocated based on the Water Quality Restoration Formula Grant Targets and Fund Allocation Methodology. The Fund Allocation Methodology considers the annual pollutant reduction allocation established for the CWSP multiplied by the standard cost for pollutant reduction, with phosphorus reduction allocations and award values scaled down to available funds.75 The standard cost for pollution reduction is determined by project type category, and 73 Act 76 of 2019 as enacted is available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/statues-rules-policies/act-76/law-rule- guidance 74 For more information on the Clean Water Board and Budget process, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/water- investment/cwi/board 75 To learn more about and view the Water Quality Restoration Formula Grant Targets and Fund Allocation Methodology, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/statues-rules-policies/act-76/resources The Methodology will be refined periodically by ANR-DEC as improved information and data become available. 73includes the costs of project design and construction. Pollution reduction allocations are further downsized to make room in the awards to cover costs associated with administration, reporting, and project identification, development, inspection, verification, operation, and maintenance (O&M). O&M of clean water projects ensures installed practices continue to contribute phosphorus reductions for the duration of the project’s functional life. Total Formula Grant estimated need based on phosphorus reduction targets will be further refined in future Clean Water Budget cycles, with continued collection of data on project costs related to project outputs/phosphorus reductions. ANR-DEC will continue to work with O&M partners to improve O&M cost estimates and establish quantitative budget targets in future years. Eligible non-regulatory clean water project types that can be funded under Water Quality Restoration Formula Grants are described in the ANR-DEC Clean Water Initiative Program’s (CWIP) Funding Policy.76 This includes projects across a range of sectors including floodplain and stream restoration, buffer plantings, stormwater management improvements, wetlands restoration, and lake shoreline restoration. CWSPs and their Basin Water Quality Councils will be responsible for determining how Formula Grant funds are awarded at the project-level, within their respective basins, using state-derived Guidance. Water Quality Restoration Formula Grants are administered by the ANR-DEC CWIP with technical project management from the ANR-DEC Watershed Planning Program (WPP). Water Quality Enhancement Grant Program The statutory intent of the Water Quality Enhancement Grant Program established through Act 76 is to protect high quality waters, maintain or improve water quality, restore degraded or stressed waters, create resilient watersheds and communities, and support the public’s use and enjoyment of the state’s waters. This is achieved in SFY 2023 through administration of a set of sub-initiatives such as: Dam Removal Design and Implementation Block Grant, Woody Riparian Buffer Block Grant, River Corridor Easements, Multi-Sector Assessments, Enhancement Development, Design & Implementation Block Grant, and Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) Wetland Incentives. Enhancement Grant Program sub-initiatives vary in structure between grants or contracts depending on the scope of work, and some funding is administered, allocated, and awarded at the project-level by a Funding Program Administrator through a block grant structure. The intent of the Water Quality Enhancement Grant Program suite of sub-initiatives is to support the life cycle of projects from identification to development through implementation. Eligible non-regulatory clean water project types that can be funded under Water Quality Enhancement Grants are described in the ANR-DEC Clean Water Initiative Program’s (CWIP) Funding Policy.76 This includes projects across a range of sectors including floodplain and stream restoration, buffer plantings, stormwater management improvements, wetlands restoration, and lake shoreline restoration. The Water Quality Enhancement Grants minimum funding level is 20 percent of the annual balance of the Clean Water Fund, provided that the maximum amount recommended shall not exceed $5,000,000. The SFY 2023 budget funded this grant category at the full $5,000,000 maximum. 76 The CWIP Funding Policy is available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/cwi/grants 74Water Quality Enhancement Grants are administered by the ANR-DEC CWIP with technical project management from the ANR-DEC CWIP and the Watershed Management Division. Developed Lands Implementation Grant Program The Developed Lands Implementation Grant Program will provide grants or financing to support individuals required comply with stormwater regulatory requirements that are necessary to achieve water quality standards. The program will support Three-Acre General Permit obtainment and compliance through design and implementation. Initial funding to support this program is through American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) federal funds directly appropriated to ANR-DEC from SFY 2022 through 2024 which will be encumbered and expended through December 2026. Initial administration of these funds will be through DEC’s Three-Acre Permit Obtainment Assistance program, which will provide beneficiary payments to landowners to support the engineering and permitting costs associated with permit obtainment. Ultimately, a financing structure will replace ARPA programs to serve as the Developed Lands Implementation Grant Program, to be designed and administered by the ANR-DEC Water Infrastructure Finance Program. The Developed Lands Implementation Grant Program is initially administered and managed by the ANR-DEC CWIP but will transition to the ANR-DEC Water Infrastructure Finance Program as a financing structure is developed in the future. Municipal Stormwater Implementation Grant Program Act 76 established the Municipal Stormwater Implementation Grant Program to provide grants to municipalities to assist with their compliance efforts under regulatory stormwater permits. 10 V.S.A § 928 states: “The Secretary shall administer a Municipal Stormwater Implementation Grant Program to provide grants to any municipality required under section 1264 of this title to obtain or seek coverage under [1] the municipal roads general permit (MRGP), [2] the municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) permit, [3] a permit for impervious surface of three acres or more, or a permit required by the Secretary to reduce the adverse impacts to water quality of a discharge or stormwater runoff.” The statutory intent of the Municipal Stormwater Implementation Grant Program is met through several complementary initiatives. The Vermont Agency of Transportation’s (VTrans) Municipal Roads Grants-in-Aid and Municipal Better Roads programs will continue to support implementation of the Municipal Roads General Stormwater permit requirements ([1]). DEC’s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Community Formula Grant program will support implementation of the MS4 stormwater requirements ([2]). DEC’s Green Schools Initiative, DEC’s Three-Acre Public Private Partnership (P3), and DEC’s Three-Acre Permit Obtainment Assistance programs will support municipalities in meeting Three-Acre General Permit stormwater requirements ([3]) . MRGP sub-initiatives are administered and managed by VTrans. MS4 and Three-Acre Permit sub-initiatives are administered and managed by ANR-DEC CWIP. 75Appendix B: The Northern Lake Champlain Direct Drainages (Basin 5) TMDL Implementation 2023 Progress Report The Accountability Framework of the 2016 Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) for Vermont Segments of Lake Champlain ensures TMDL implementation moves forward at a steady rate. A major driver of the Accountability Framework is the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) development of basin-specific Tactical Basin Plans (TBP). The TBPs are developed on a five-year rotating basis and include Implementation Tables that identify priority actions needed to implement the TMDL. It is through review of the Implementation Tables, and the progress made in accomplishing the tasks that U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tracks implementation progress in each basin. To facilitate EPA’s evaluation of progress, DEC describes the status of each strategy midway through (2.5 years) and at the conclusion of the five-year planning cycle in interim and final report cards, respectively. Appendix B is the interim report card for the 2020 Northern Lake Champlain Direct Basin. The 2.5-year reporting period began in January 2021 coincident with the publication of the 2020 Northern Lake Champlain Direct Basin77 and goes through June 30, 2023. Data in this report align with this 2.5-year period (SFY 2021–SFY 2023) available through the Clean Water Reporting Framework (CWRF). Due to a change in the TBP development schedule, the Watershed Planning Program will be accelerating the development of the next iteration of the Northern Lake Champlain Direct Drainages (Basin 5) TBP to be completed by the end of 2024 instead of the end of 2025. As such, the reporting period for Basin 5 during this period will be curtailed from a 5-year period to a 4-year period, which will result in the final TBP Report Card issuance concurrent with the Clean Water Initiative 2024 Performance Report. It should be noted that the subsequent Basin 5 TBP development will then progress on a 5-year cycle going forward, and the next iteration of the Basin 5 TBP will be completed by the end of 2029 instead of 2030, along with the corresponding TMDL “phase 4” content and final report card for that next 5-year reporting period. The following sections describe progress towards completing strategies in the 2020 Northern Lake Champlain Direct TBP Implementation Table. Each strategy is organized by one of five major sectors – agriculture, developed lands, natural resources, forestry, and wastewater. Progress described for each strategy includes status (defined in Table B-1) as well as an explanation of actions taken. The explanation describes how the Agency and partners supported the strategy and resulting outcomes that together show that meaningful results were achieved. The outcomes include performance measures for Agency-supported assistance that were collected as part of the Accountability Framework (see Accountability Measures). Phosphorus reductions for the Northern Lake Champlain basin were estimated to have met about 31 percent of the basin’s total load reduction targets set by the TMDL, based on basin- 77 The 2020 Northern Lake Champlain Direct Drainages Tactical Basin Plan available at: https://dec.vermont.gov/water- investment/watershed-planning/tactical-basin-planning/basin5 76level data summarized in the clean water reporting framework. While this report card does not discuss trends in annual phosphorus reductions, estimated trends since SFY 2016 can be found by basin and by sector in the TMDL reduction estimates interactive online report. Trends and five-year phosphorus reduction targets will also be published and further discussed in the 2024 Basin 5 TBP’s Lake Champlain TMDL Phase 3, and any gaps will be noted in the final progress report. Basin 5 Update The 2020 TBP strategies were evaluated and their associated actions were assigned a status condition using the rationale described in Table B-1. Of the 53 strategies identified to date, 9 have been completed, 40 are ongoing, three are in progress, and one has not been started (Figure B-1). The likelihood of completion by the final progress report was evaluated as low, medium or high for the in progress and not started strategies. The ongoing strategies have to date achieved the expected results, but additional work is expected before the final progress report is submitted. Of the three actions that are in progress, all have a medium or high likelihood of being completed by 2024. The strategy that has not been started will most likely be replaced by another approach to meeting the same goal in the next iteration of the TBP and therefore has a low likelihood of completion as currently framed. The strategies with a high likelihood of being completed are those that have received funding and have a strong partner and local support. They are also farther along in the process. In addition, some strategies are regulatory and are required to be completed. Strategies that have a medium likelihood of completion have been initiated and may have received funding, but the end date for completion is beyond 2024. In many cases, medium likelihood strategies have support, but may lack funding or a partner to bring the project to fruition. These projects are next in line to be completed once the high likelihood actions are complete, which will free up capacity for partners that carry out the projects. Strategies with low likelihood of completion by 2024 are those that require significant funding and resources to complete. In some cases, support exists, and funding may be available, but a partner’s capacity to develop the associated action(s) is lacking. 77Table B-1: Status conditions assigned to strategies and actions in the TBP Implementation Table (Table B-2).

In addition, there was a steady TBP Implementation Table. increase in resources provided by the state to community and partners, which in turn supported a steady increase of adoption of natural resource restoration practices, and stormwater management of developed land. Available funding and advanced coordination played a critical role in allowing watershed partners and municipalities to work together to complete and pursue 17% of strategies from the 2020 78Northern Lake Champlain Direct Drainages TBP to-date. The majority of the strategies (75%) are ongoing, with meaningful progress made towards completion of the strategies. Six percent of the 53 strategies in the 2020 plan are still in progress. The narrative in Table B-2 provides additional detail in the explanation column for strategies in progress. Most projects in progress have completed the first phase of action, for example, planning or discussions towards completion of the strategy have occurred with no barriers identified towards completion. As of SFY 2023, additional resources became available to support non-regulatory actions in the plan through the Clean Water Service Delivery Act (Act 76).78 The act will increasingly support the delivery of clean water services and increase regional capacity to develop and implement non regulatory projects. The Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission (CCRPC) is the Northern Lake Champlain basin Clean Water Service Provider. In SFY 2023 DEC awarded CCRPC a grant for $645,340 to achieve an annual phosphorus reduction target of 41.9kg by supporting the development, implementation, and maintenance of non-regulatory clean water projects. In SFY 2024, CVRPC received $741,808 to achieve an additional 45.1kg. Additional funding and phosphorus reduction targets will be provided each year of this initial CWSP assignment term through June 30, 2028. Basin 5 Implementation Table Status The interim status for each strategy (Table B-2) was compiled by the Water Investment Division’s Watershed Planning Program using data from the DEC, NRCDs, RPCs, and watershed partners involved in project development and implementation for the 2.5-year interim period. The Implementation Table is not an exhaustive list of water quality strategies that lead to phosphorus reductions in a basin. A complete description of all the work that the state supports in the basin to meet water quality goals can be found in the 2021 Vermont Nonpoint Source Management Plan.79 Additional information about progress associated with each sector can be found in Chapter 3 of the Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report, which provides comprehensive reporting of estimated total phosphorus load reductions associated with state funding, federal funding, and regulatory programs in the Lake Champlain basin. These data are also available to the public through the Clean Water Portal’s Clean Water Interactive Dashboard – an online tool that allows interested parties to examine and filter Performance Report data on investments, project outputs, estimated pollutant load reductions and project cost effectiveness. Individual projects in the basin that are included or supported by strategies are described in the Clean Water Explorer, also found through the Portal. 80 78 Act 76 website available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/statues-rules-policies/act-76 79 Vermont Nonpoint Source Management Plan 2021-2025 available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/sites/dec/files/wsm/erp/docs/Vermont%20NPS%20Management%20Plan%202021-2025.pdf 80 Clean Water Portal can be accessed here: https://anrweb.vt.gov/DEC/cleanWaterDashboard/ 79Table B-2.

A major driver of the Accountability Framework is the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) development of basin-specific Tactical Basin Plans (TBP). TBPs are developed on a five-year rotating basis and include Implementation Tables that identify priority actions needed to implement the TMDL. It is through review of the Implementation Tables, and the progress made in accomplishing the tasks, that U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tracks implementation progress in each basin. To facilitate EPA’s evaluation of progress, DEC describes the status of each strategy midway through (2.5 years) and at the conclusion of the five-year planning cycle in interim and final report cards, respectively. Appendix C is the final report card for the 2018 Winooski TBP. The 5-year reporting period began coincident with the publication of the 2018 Winooski TBP and goes through June 30, 2023. Data in this appendix align with the 5-year reporting period (SFY 2019–SFY 2023) available through the Clean Water Reporting Framework (CWRF). The following sections describe progress towards completing strategies in the 2018 Winooski TBP Implementation Table. Each strategy is organized by one of five major sectors – agriculture, developed lands, natural resources, forestry, and wastewater. Progress described for each strategy includes status (defined in Table C-1) as well as an explanation of actions taken. The explanation describes how the Agency and partners supported the strategy and resulting outcomes that together show that meaningful results were achieved. The outcomes include performance measures for Agency-supported assistance that were collected as part of the Accountability Framework (see Accountability Measures). Phosphorus reductions for the Winooski basin were estimated to have met about 14 percent of the basin’s total load reduction targets set by the TMDL, based on basin-level data summarized in the clean water reporting framework. While this report card does not discuss trends in annual phosphorus reductions, estimated trends since SFY 2016 can be found by basin and by sector in the TMDL reduction estimates interactive online report. Trends, as well future five-year phosphorus targets, are also further discussed in the 2023 Winooski Tactical Basin Plan’s Lake Champlain TMDL Phase 3 content. Basin 8 Update The 2018 TBP strategies were evaluated, and their associated actions were assigned a status condition using the rationale described in Table C-1. To address strategies identified as ongoing in the 2023 Winooski Tactical Basin Plan, a status of complete, continued, or discontinued has been assigned to previously ongoing projects. Of the 52 strategies identified, to date 32 were completed, 17 are in progress, two are continued, and one is discontinued (Figure C-1). 98Table C-1: Status conditions assigned to strategies and actions in the TBP Implementation Table (Table C-2).

This report depicts a watershed community that is pursuing permit compliance and implementing voluntary practices that work towards meeting the state’s water quality and phosphorus reduction goals. This is achieved through the implementation of permit programs, installation of green stormwater practices, adoption of flood resilience measures, implementation of farm agronomic practices, and application of riparian restoration and conservation projects. As described in the final status report for the 2018 Winooski TBP Implementation Table (Table C-2), most of the actions associated with regulatory programs were completed or were in progress by the interim reporting period. A majority of those were completed through Agency of Natural Resources (ANR) or Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets (AAFM) financial support to permit holders as well as partners who distributed education, outreach, and technical assistance. Regulatory compliance outcomes include increased implementation of Required Agricultural Practices (RAPs) and agricultural best management practices (BMPs) and stormwater BMPs on roads. In addition, there was a steady increase in resources provided by the state to communities and partners supporting natural resource restoration practices and stormwater management of developed land. 99Available funding and advanced coordination played a critical role in allowing watershed partners and Continued Discontinued 2, 4% 1, 2% municipalities to work together to significantly advance 94% of the strategies from the 2018 Winooski TBP (Figure C-1). Phase 3 of the TMDL in the 2023 TBP provides additional information that In Progress 17, 33% explains sector-level progress on meeting TMDL goals to date as well as expectations for areas of accelerated progress. This progress is an outcome of strategy Completed implementation in the 2018 TBP. 61% of 32, 61% strategies were completed. Completed strategies were often related to either regulatory implementation as described above, the completion of discrete tasks, or the continued or accelerating implementation of programmatic strategies Figure C-1: Basin 8 Implementation Table over the full five-year period. The narrative action status of the 52 strategies in the 2018 in Table C-2 provides additional detail in TBP Implementation Table. the explanation column. 33% of the strategies are still in progress. Those strategies in progress that were pursued and then updated as a new strategy in the 2023 Winooski TBP will be reported on during the next planning cycle. Most projects in progress have completed the first phase of action, for example, a design may have been completed for a project, but the implementation of the project will be completed in the next year. Other “In Progress” strategies are those in which slightly revised approaches to the same goal warrant continued strategy tracking in the 2023 TBP. A few lakes-related strategies were not implemented because of a lack of community capacity, but these “Continued” strategies are still a priority for follow-up if partners identify or can encourage growing interest among lake communities. Finally, one strategy was discontinued because of a lack of partner capacity and interest to pursue a specific stormwater runoff phenomenon (capturing private lands stormwater before it reaches public roads). In the 2023 TBP, a new set of strategies are identified that represent the next phase of work associated with regulatory programs, or improved approaches that partners can take with agency resources to encourage implementation in the community. Additional accounting methodology will capture information on more restoration and protection activities on the landscape and show a more accurate representation of total phosphorus reductions achieved. In addition, the Clean Water Service Delivery Act (Act 76) will increasingly support the delivery of clean water services and increase regional capacity to develop and implement projects that fulfill actions.83 The Central Vermont Regional Planning Commission (CVRPC) is the Winooski basin Clean Water Service Provider. In SFY 2023 DEC awarded CVRPC a grant for $1,040,947 to achieve an annual phosphorus reduction target of 69.6 kilograms by supporting the development, implementation, and maintenance of non-regulatory clean water projects. In SFY 2024, CVRPC received $1,097,230 to achieve an additional 69.6 kilograms. An explanation of DEC’s expected progress based on these additional resources is included in the 2023 TBP’s 83 Act 76 website available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/statues-rules-policies/act-76 100Chapter 3 (LC TMDL Phase 3) and Chapter 4. DEC will submit the interim report for the 2023 Tactical Basin Plans in 2026 and the final report in 2028. Basin 8 Implementation Table Status The status for each strategy (Table C-2) was compiled by the Water Investment Division’s Watershed Planning Program using data from the DEC, NRCDs, RPCs, and additional watershed partners involved in project development and implementation for the five-year planning period. The Implementation Table is not an exhaustive list of water quality strategies that lead to phosphorus reductions in a basin. A complete description of all the work that the state supports in the basin to meet water quality goals can be found in the 2021 Vermont Nonpoint Source Management Plan.84 Additional information about progress associated with each sector can be found in Chapter 3 of the Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report which provides comprehensive reporting of estimated total phosphorus load reductions associated with state funding, federal funding, and regulatory programs in the Lake Champlain basin. These data are also available to the public through the Clean Water Portal’s Clean Water Interactive Dashboard – an online tool that allows interested parties to examine and filter Performance Report data on investments, project outputs, estimated pollutant load reductions and project cost effectiveness. Individual projects in the basin that are included or supported by strategies are described in the Clean Water Explorer, also found through The Portal.85 84 Vermont Nonpoint Source Management Plan 2021-2025 available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/sites/dec/files/wsm/erp/docs/Vermont%20NPS%20Management%20Plan%202021-2025.pdf 85 Clean Water Portal can be accessed here: https://anrweb.vt.gov/DEC/cleanWaterDashboard/ 101Table C-2: Basin 8 Implementation Final Status Report; includes data from SFY 2019 to SFY 2023 unless otherwise noted.

For MS4 communities, proper management of salt in and around their facilities falls under one of the six required Minimum Control Measures of their permit: Good Housekeeping of Municipal Operations. 111FMR, FWR, and WNRCD collectively completed 232 residential stormwater assessments through their Storm Smart program. The program makes recommendations for simple residential stormwater management actions, including addressing storm water concerns associated with driveways. In the first phase of the program, 66 of these homesite assessments resulted in 407 recommended stormwater BMPs including 18 infiltration trenches, 14 vegetated swales, 30 driveway regrading projects, 11 riparian buffer plantings, 7 filter berms, 15 rain gardens, 7 filter berms, and 98 improved lawn care or native planting recommendations. While the same types of management actions above are still recommended, in the second phase of the Storm Smart program partners have focused their project tracking on larger identified BMPs that can be developed through various Clean Water funds.

Rethink Runoff is an ongoing awareness and public outreach campaign carried out on behalf of Chittenden County MS4 and TS4 permittees. The program offers online stormwater education materials, hosts workshops on residential stormwater topics, and manages volunteer programs for storm drain cleaning, stream clean ups, rain garden maintenance, and water quality monitoring (the Stream Team). A 2023 public Rethink Runoff survey indicates where residential stormwater management behaviors have improved, lapsed, or stayed constant over the past 20 years and hints at stormwater practices where messaging could be improved. 112Priority Priority Strategy Description Sector Final Status Explanation Subbasin(s) Towns 15 river corridor plans have been completed in the basin, including one since the 2018 TBP (Lower Mad River). Geomorphic assessments have been completed in an additional 10 watersheds, though additional RCPs have not been developed for these systems. 560 potential projects in the Watershed Projects Database are tied directly to River Corridor Plan or Stream Geomorphic Assessment Development, while CVRPC has identified about 100 additional RCP or SGA projects that are still candidates for inclusion in the WPD.

Most implemented projects were originally identified in River Corridor Plans, or otherwise were identified as a high priority project by the DEC watershed planner and river scientist. Note that DEC data do not track most types of private funding which may support significant natural resource restoration activity. For example, the basin’s most active planting partner (FWR) implemented 38 acres of riparian buffer since 2019 according to their own records. About 20% of this work was funded by private sources. However, because of the complexity of project financing, it is difficult to explicitly parse privately funded from government-funded project acreage. In general, implementation metrics here should be considered conservative; additional work may have been done with private funds. 113Priority Priority Strategy Description Sector Final Status Explanation Subbasin(s) Towns A multi-partner AOP working group including USFWS, FWD, FWR, and WNRCD scoped about two dozen stream crossings and targeted culvert upgrade work in the Stevens Branch (Williamstown, Barre) and Winooski headwaters (Cabot, Marshfield, Plainfield) sub-watersheds.

Eight towns increased their ERAF ratings since the 2018 TBP and two towns adopted protective river corridor bylaws (South Burlington, Huntington). However, during the same period the ERAF rating of six municipalities declined because of lapsed LEMPs or LHMPs. A dam removal working group (FWR, WNRCD, LCCD, VTNRC, VFWD, USFWS, TNC, CVRPC) has developed a list of nine dams that are in various stages of project development moving toward removal and another 21 dams that partners will scope as potential future projects.

However, landowner buy in is obviously important in implementing projects and has currently stalled the efforts of gully stabilization beyond the design phase for one basin partner. Through the MRGP, towns will also address road stormwater causing gullies where associated with prioritized road segments in REIs. 116In addition to its in-stream habitat benefits, strategic wood addition may have stream stability, flood attenuation, and water quality benefits where sited appropriately. While strategic wood addition has been practiced in Vermont for more than a decade, there appears to have been a recent surge of interest in this type of work in the Winooski basin and elsewhere in the state. However, stakeholders have various perspectives on SWA project identification, development, implementation, and even definitions of SWA itself. To streamline SWA understanding and accelerate good project implementation, the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department developed an SWA guidance document in 2020 and the Rivers Program followed suit in 2021. Moreover, SWA working groups that include multiple state programs, federal program staff, and SWA practitioners are meeting regularly to discuss identification, permitting, and funding Remediate habitat in highly considerations of SWA.

Partners are currently applying to Clean Water funding programs to support this work. This work is not currently proposed for the target sub-watersheds, but one of these watersheds (Dog River) has been identified as a target geography for a Winooski in-stream and floodplain restoration working group organized by The Nature Conservancy. The Agency's understanding of the joint fish habitat and water quality benefits of this project type is still in its infancy, but there appears to be interest in scaling up this work (as well as related beaver dam analog and post-assisted log structure project types).

        "Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report Executive Summary Vermont’s waterways are important environmental and economic resources for residents and visitors. The State of Vermont funds clean water projects to protect, enhance, and restore water quality across the state. Clean water projects are regulatory or non-regulatory practices or protections that address water pollution, including excess nutrients and sediment. The Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report, referred to hereafter as Report, summarizes efforts of state government, along with federal and local partners, to improve water quality across Vermont from state fiscal year (SFY) 2016 to 2023 (July 1, 2015–June 30, 2023). Clean Water Investments Vermont’s clean water funding helps municipalities, farmers, landowners, and nonprofit organizations implement clean water projects statewide. Collectively, state and federal funding programs, as well as regulatory requirements, drive clean water implementation efforts in Vermont. $100 $92.5 million $90 $80 $70 $64.4 million $62.6 million $58.5 million $60 $51.6 million $50.3 million $50 $40 $28.7 million $30 $20 $11.6 million $10 $0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 The State of Vermont invested over $420 million in clean water projects through grants, contracts, and loans from SFY 2016 to SFY 2023. The amount of funding awarded to clean water projects rose significantly between 2016 and 2023. Project funding varies annually based on project readiness, award timing, and economic factors.

        "Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Progress The 2023 Performance Report summarizes the state’s progress in implementing the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). TMDLs identify water pollution (e.g., phosphorus) reductions required to restore water quality. The figures below show the estimated total phosphorus load reduction (metric tons per year) achieved by clean water project implementation thus far in the Lake Champlain (left) and Lake Memphremagog (right) basins. Estimates include the results of projects implemented through state and federal funding programs and in response to regulatory requirements. See Report Chapters 3 and 4 for more information. 50 45.0 42.7 41.5 40 33.2 30 27.5 21.4 19.0 20 12.9 10 0 Figure ES-2: Annual estimated total phosphorus load reductions (metric tons per year) associated with reported clean water projects in the Lake Champlain (left) and Lake Memphremagog (right) basins during SFY 2016–2023 by land use sector. Over the past eight state fiscal years, the state has made substantial progress towards reaching the water quality targets outlined in the state's large-scale phosphorus TMDLs, with 20% of the required reduction achieved to date in the Lake Champlain basin and 14% of the required reduction achieved to date in the Lake Memphremagog basin. Achieving the water quality goals outlined in the state’s large-scale TMDLs is not a linear path — variance in the rate of progress is to be expected over the 20-year implementation period. The rate of progress in estimated phosphorus reductions in both the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog basins has slowed in SFY 2023, however several ongoing factors are expected to accelerate the rate of progress in future years, including: 8 noitcudeR daoL surohpsohP latoT detamitsE nisaB nialpmahC ekaL eht ni )raeY/snoT cirteM( 2.5 2.1 2.0 2.1 2 1.9 1.7 1.5 1.0 1 0.5 0.5 0.2 0 State Fiscal Year (SFY) noitcudeR daoL surohpsohP latoT detamitsE nisaB gogamerhpmeM ekaL eht ni )raeY/snoT cirteM( State Fiscal Year (SFY)",
        "• State funding programs at the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation have shifted to block grant structures that rely on regional partners to manage and administer funding of individual projects. The transition to regional administration of clean water funding is anticipated to empower community partners, reduce bottlenecks, and increase the impact of clean water investments. • Vermont has received an influx in federal funding under the American Rescue Plan Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as increased Clean Water Fund revenue enacted under Act 76 of 2019. Program expansion supported by this funding will drive clean water project implementation across sectors. • The State of Vermont has been expanding clean water regulatory, financial, and technical assistance programs since SFY 2016. Many regulatory programs are now in place that will drive meaningful progress in the agriculture and developed lands sectors. • The State is investing to expand the capacity of the clean water workforce. Investments in our partner network to support capacity expansion are expected to increase clean water progress and reduce reporting lags. • The State is expanding its ability to fully capture results in its tracking and reporting, such as estimating phosphorus reductions for additional project types in the natural resources sector. Enhanced tracking and reporting will provide a more complete picture of progress on the ground. Continued effort, investment, and coordination are critical in the state’s ability to reach its water quality goals. The Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report serves as a useful tool to provide accountability on the state’s clean water progress and to inform adaptive management. By taking an adaptive management approach, the state will continue to identify and prioritize its resources to break down barriers to project implementation and clean water progress. Clean water project implementation is an important piece of climate resilience work and clean water projects have co-benefits like increased flood resilience, improved carbon sequestration, better soil health, and improved habitat function and biodiversity. In addition to achieving water quality goals, Vermont’s work to improve water quality directly supports climate adaptation and flood mitigation, which will increase the state’s resilience to future climate related stressors. 9",
        "Chapter 1: Introduction Vermont’s lakes, rivers, wetlands, and reservoirs are important environmental and economic resources for residents and visitors. Vermont’s waterways provide safe drinking water and recreational opportunities for thousands of people and support local economies by fostering tourism. High-quality streams, lakes, and wetlands also support wildlife habitat and increase flood resilience for local communities. The State of Vermont has made it a priority to support partners’ work to restore, enhance, and protect Vermont’s water quality. This includes work to address priority sources of nutrient and sediment pollution. This report summarizes the efforts of the state government and its partners to improve water quality across Vermont since the passage of Act 64, Vermont’s Clean Water Act, in 2015. Protecting and Restoring Clean Water in Vermont Vermont’s waterways vary in quality — some waters are of exceptional quality and require protection, and some waters suffer from excess pollution and require restoration. Impaired waters requiring restoration are a priority to mitigate adverse impacts on ecosystems, human health, and economic activity. In Vermont, a primary water quality challenge of concern is pollution caused by excess sediment and nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, originating from the land and carried to waterways through runoff. Nonpoint source pollution results from sediment and nutrients from the land being transported to waterways by rainfall and snowmelt traveling through agricultural fields, roads, parking lots, forests, and streambanks. Nonpoint source pollution is more difficult to manage than point source pollution, which enters waterways from an easily identified and confined place, such as a discharge pipe from a wastewater treatment facility. Excess phosphorus loading can lead to cyanobacteria blooms in Vermont’s lakes (Figure 1).4 Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are a natural component of surface waters and provide important ecological services, such as photosynthesis and the transfer of nitrogen from the atmosphere to the aquatic environment through nitrogen fixation. However, cyanobacteria blooms can produce toxins that may be harmful to people, animals, and the environment. The Vermont Department of Health, Vermont Department of Environmental Figure 1: Cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Champlain. Conservation (DEC), and partners Credit: Lake Champlain Committee monitor cyanobacteria blooms around the state and notify the public when cyanobacteria blooms make it unsafe to recreate at designated monitoring locations.5 4 To learn more about phosphorus, water pollution, and cyanobacteria, read this clean water plain language one-pager. 5 Information related to public health and safety of recreating in Vermont’s waterbodies is available through the Vermont Department of Health, here: https://www.healthvermont.gov/environment/tracking/cyanobacteria-blue-green-algae-tracker 10",
        "Clean water restoration plans, known as Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), identify pollutant reductions required for an impaired waterbody to meet the State of Vermont’s water quality standards. TMDLs set up long term pollutant reduction targets to mitigate both nonpoint source and point source pollution. Most of the State of Vermont is covered by three large-scale TMDLs that require nutrient loading reductions, as shown in Figure 2. Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog TMDLs target phosphorus pollution to address cyanobacteria blooms and other excess algae and aquatic plant growth. The five-state Long Island Sound TMDL targets nitrogen pollution, which causes low dissolved oxygen and dead zones in the Sound. The State of Vermont also has numerous small-scale TMDLs across the state.6 Coordinated implementation of large-scale and small-scale TMDLs supports local and regional water quality restoration. Figure 2: Vermont's large-scale TMDLs that require nutrient pollutant reductions. Tactical Planning Basins also shown. Vermont’s Clean Water Act (Act 64 of 2015) To further the state’s work to restore, enhance, and protect Vermont’s water quality, and to provide reasonable assurance on the state’s ability to meet nonpoint source pollution reduction targets outlined by the TMDLs, Vermont’s Clean Water Act (Act 64 of 2015) was signed into law in June 2015. The Act strengthened the regulatory and financial structures available to address sources of water pollution, with a focus on sediment and nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen). The Act established the Clean Water Fund to provide a financial mechanism to support clean water work statewide. Act 64 also initiated accountability and transparency requirements to track and report on the progress of water quality improvement efforts receiving state financial support and obligations through state regulatory requirements. 6 For more information on TMDLs in Vermont, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/map/tmdl 11",

Each Tactical Basin Plan contains Figure 3: Five-Year Tactical Basin a list of priority projects and strategies necessary to Planning Process achieve clean water goals.7 Clean Water Projects Clean water projects, described in Table 1 and throughout this report, refer to regulatory or non- regulatory practices or actions that restore, enhance, and protect Vermont’s water quality.8 All land use sectors contribute to Vermont’s water quality challenges and all sectors have opportunities for improvement. Clean water projects are categorized into land use sectors based on the dominant land use of the area surrounding the project. Clean water projects help to support compliance with the Vermont and federal Clean Water Acts and may help to leverage additional federal funds. Examples of some clean water projects by land use sector are provided in the table below, along with a summary of the additional benefits clean water projects provide. Clean water projects provide co-benefits for the environment and local communities, such as increasing flood resilience, improving habitat function and biodiversity, supporting carbon sequestration, improving soil health, supporting workforce development, and providing local economic stimulus. 7 To learn more about Tactical Basin Planning in Vermont, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/watershed-planning 8 Clean water project may be defined differently or more narrowly in certain contexts, such as in relation to Act 76 of 2019. 12",

        "Report Purpose and Scope The purpose of the Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report is to summarize the results of the State of Vermont’s clean water investments, educational opportunities, and regulatory programs from state fiscal year (SFY) 2016 through 2023 (July 1, 2015–June 30, 2023). The report also summarizes how state funding programs, federal funding programs, and regulatory requirements contribute to achieving the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog TMDLs.9 Data presented in this report are representative of the most complete available data at the close of the state fiscal year. Data reported in previous years is subject to change in future annual reports as project information becomes available. This report fulfills state statutory and federal reporting requirements, as outlined on Page 2. The Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report is divided into chapters based on geographic region. The purpose of each geographically focused chapter is to report progress in each of Vermont’s major nutrient TMDL watersheds. Figure 4 shows a map of the geographic regions with large-scale nutrient TMDLs and corresponding chapter numbers.10 Chapter 2 - Statewide Chapter 4 - Lake Chapter 3 - Lake Memphremagog Champlain Basin Basin Chapter 5 - Connecticut River Basin Figure 4: Geographic scope and focus of the Vermont Clean Water Initiative 2023 Performance Report chapters. Collectively, state funding programs, federal funding programs, and regulatory requirements drive clean water efforts in Vermont. All three program categories work together to achieve 9 The State of Vermont also has numerous small-scale TMDLs. For example, Lake Carmi in Franklin County also suffers from cyanobacteria blooms, thus the Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load for Lake Cami was established in 2009. Since Lake Carmi is located in the Lake Champlain basin, actions to reduce phosphorus pollution in Lake Carmi support both the implementation of the Lake Carmi TMDL and Lake Champlain TMDL. Implementation of large-scale and small-scale TMDLs can support both local and regional water quality priorities. 10 Results in the Hudson River drainage basin are included in the statewide results reported in Chapter 2 and can be viewed in the Clean Water Interactive Dashboard: https://anrweb.vt.gov/DEC/cleanWaterDashboard/ 14",

        "Chapter 2: Statewide Clean Water Investments and Results The State of Vermont’s clean water investments are channeled through grant, loan, and assistance programs to strategically restore and safeguard the state’s rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and wetlands. These funds are used to help identify and prioritize clean water projects, as well as to design, implement, and, in some cases, maintain projects. The State of Vermont tracks outputs of state investments at the project level to quantify the impact of clean water efforts statewide. This chapter summarizes statewide investments awarded to clean water projects by State of Vermont agencies as well as project output measures achieved through completion of clean water projects funded by State of Vermont agencies. Vermont’s Clean Water Funding The State of Vermont is committed to maintaining and improving water quality through financial and technical assistance and regulation. Vermont's clean water funding helps municipalities, farmers, landowners, and nonprofit organizations implement projects that will restore, enhance, and protect Vermont’s water quality. Funds from state programs complement and leverage other funding sources to support clean water efforts statewide. The Vermont Clean Water Board and Budget Process The Clean Water Board was created as a result of Act 64 of 2015, Vermont’s Clean Water Act, and is responsible for planning, coordinating, and financing the restoration, enhancement, and protection of Vermont’s water quality. Composed of representatives from five state agencies and four members of the public, the Board recommends to the Governor an annual Clean Water Budget that is made up of Clean Water Fund, Capital Bill, and American Rescue Plan Act dollars.18 Once the budget is recommended and approved by the Legislature, the funds are awarded to multiple state agencies and affiliates that work to address water quality challenges across land use sectors. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) is part of the federal COVID-19 response to address economic impacts due to the pandemic. The State of Vermont will receive $1.026 billion in ARPA funds to invest in broadband infrastructure, clean water, climate action, housing, and economic development to be encumbered by December 31, 2024 and expended by the end of calendar year 2026. The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources is responsible for distributing a portion of these ARPA funds to support water and wastewater infrastructure programs.19 A subset of the ARPA funding was 18 To learn more, visit the Clean Water Board webpage: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/cwi/board 19 Visit the ANR ARPA webpage for more information on types of water and wastewater infrastructure programs: https://anr.vermont.gov/special-topics/arpa-vermont 19",

The following sections summarize statewide investments in clean water projects by land use sector, funding source, and project step over the past eight state fiscal years.21 State Investments by Land Use Sector Reaching Vermont’s water quality goals requires investments across all land use sectors. The following figure summarizes state clean water investments by land use sector statewide over the past eight state fiscal years, from SFY 2016 to 2023. $100 $92.5 million $90 $80 $64.4 million $70 $62.6 million $58.5 million $60 $51.6 million $50.3 million $50 $40 $28.7 million $30 $20 $11.6 million $10 $0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Figure 7: Total dollars awarded by State of Vermont agencies to clean water projects statewide by land use sector, SFY 2016–2023. Explanation of Figure 7 The State of Vermont has invested over $420 million in clean water projects statewide from SFY 2016 to 2023. Annual clean water investments have increased significantly since SFY 2016, but funding awarded to projects varies from year-to-year based on project readiness and the timing of awards. In SFY 2021, COVID-19’s economic impacts affected Clean Water Fund revenue sources and capacity to administer and implement projects, which led to a slight reduction in appropriation and a temporary slowdown of funding programs. Funding levels recovered in SFY 2022 and 2023, supported in part by a short-term influx of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) dollars. 21 To view clean water investments by basin, visit the Clean Water Interactive Dashboard: https://anrweb.vt.gov/DEC/cleanWaterDashboard/ 21 sralloD deganaM etatS fo snoilliM Click symbol to view description of accountability measures.

        "State Investments by Project Step Making wise investments in cost-effective clean water projects requires thorough project planning, analysis, design, and implementation. In addition, operation and maintenance of existing projects is important to sustaining project function and clean water outcomes. Investing in the project development process is key to ensuring state investments will yield the greatest water quality improvement per dollar, which includes de-prioritizing lower-value or non-viable projects early in development.

Approximately 10 percent of clean water investments are used in the planning, design, and engineering phases. Targeted water quality monitoring represents passthrough funds that are used to support focused, small watershed scale monitoring, but does not capture all water quality monitoring efforts in Vermont. The “Other” category includes agreements that do not fit squarely into one project step, including multiple block grants issued to partners who will use the money to develop, design, and implement several projects.

        "Vermont’s Statewide Education, Outreach, and Technical Assistance Click symbol to view description of accountability measures. Reducing nutrient and sediment pollution sources requires employing sound land management practices which can necessitate changes to our cities and towns, farms, forests, and natural spaces. Education and outreach related to clean water projects and programs is critical to achieve our water quality goals. The State of Vermont delivers clean water education through outreach (workshops, trainings, and public/stakeholder meetings) and technical assistance (targeted, one-on-one interactions). Clean water education, outreach, and technical assistance aim to: • Increase public awareness and engagement in establishing and implementing clean water priorities; • Increase landowner acceptance of new and changing policies and willingness to adopt best management practices; • Support regulated entities in preparing to meet new regulatory requirements in the most cost-effective manner; • Support clean water project proponents, including regulated entities, in building expertise to develop, plan, and secure resources to implement clean water projects; and • Increase adoption and effectiveness of best management practices to improve water quality. Educational efforts support all land use sectors in planning and securing resources to implement clean water projects. The following section summarizes education, outreach, and technical assistance efforts by land use sector. Clean Water Outreach by Organization Reported outreach is provided by state reporting partners, as well as partners who receive clean water funding from state agencies to conduct outreach.

In SFY 2020 to 2023, there was a decrease in the overall number of outreach events reported compared to previous years. This is in part related to the COVID-19 pandemic limiting in-person outreach. The need for, and the resources available to support, clean water outreach efforts fluctuate. For example, outreach efforts were critical in the development of foundational programs to drive Vermont’s clean water efforts, including the initial phases of implementing the Lake Champlain TMDL and the Vermont Clean Water Act (Act 64 of 2015). More recently, outreach efforts have supported partners in the development and implementation of programs under Act 76 of 2019. As these programs move from development and launch into implementation, the need for continued education and outreach events on these topic areas may be reduced. Note, the entities responsible for reporting outreach efforts are ANR, AAFM, VTrans, and external partners conducting outreach under the scope of a state grant or contract agreement, however many events include multiple outreaching organizations. Outreach not directly conducted by state agencies and/or supported by state funding are not included in these data. 24 For presentation purposes, the figure above includes organizations that reported more than zero hours of education between SFY 2016 and SFY 2023 grouped into the categories above. “Agricultural Associations” include both regional and statewide organizations connecting and supporting the agricultural sector. “Other” includes ECO AmeriCorps, Lake Champlain Basin Program, Lake Champlain Sea Grant, Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, Vermont League of Cities & Towns, and Federation of Vermont Lakes & Ponds. 26 dedivorP hcaertuO fo sruoH State Fiscal Year (SFY) Other Watershed Organizations VTrans Vermont Rural Water Association UVM Extension USDA-NRCS Regional Planning Commissions Natural Resources Conservation Districts ANR Agricultural Associations AAFM",

Percentages reflect the proportion of total attendees in each target audience. Explanation of Figure 12 The state’s outreach efforts target a wide range of different sector- and organization- based audiences. One of the state’s water quality priorities is to support municipalities and farmers in addressing stormwater, wastewater, and agricultural sources of nutrient pollution, which is why these audiences represent a large proportion of the target audiences above. In addition, regional planning commissions and non-governmental organizations, such as watershed groups and natural resource conservation districts, play an important role in working with municipalities, farmers, and other landowners to secure funds to implement priority clean water projects. It is crucial to keep the public engaged to broaden support of the state’s clean water efforts and bolster landowner willingness to adopt and implement voluntary, non-regulatory clean water projects. 27",

Clean water projects restore, enhance, and protect water quality by addressing the sources and causes of sediment and nutrient pollution across land use sectors. The following section summarizes the results of state-funded and regulatory clean water projects completed statewide to improve the state’s water quality. Some measures have been rounded to the nearest whole number for reporting purposes, but totals have been calculated using unrounded numbers.29 Statewide Results of Agricultural Pollution Prevention Projects Agricultural pollution prevention projects involve the installation or application of conservation practices that reduce sources of nutrient and sediment pollution from farm production areas and agricultural fields. The following table summarizes project outputs associated with state-funded agricultural pollution prevention projects, technical assistance, and regulatory programs.

For example, 10 acres of manure injection and 10 acres of cover crop applied on the same field will amount to 20 acres of agricultural conservation practices implemented in reported project outputs. Similarly, practices implemented on the same field over multiple years will be counted for each year implemented. For example, 10 acres of cover crop implemented on the same field in 2016, 2017, and 2018 will amount to 30 acres of agricultural conservation practices implemented in reported project outputs. The total agricultural project outputs column represents the total level of effort of state funding programs, rather than the number of distinct agricultural acres addressed. 31 Acres of agricultural conservation practices includes aeration, conservation crop rotation, cover crop, crop to hay, grassed waterways, manure injection, conservation tillage, and rotational grazing. 31",

        "Explanation of Table 5 The number of agricultural pollution prevention projects implemented statewide has consistently increased each year since SFY 2016. Many of the project output measures tracked in the agricultural sector show impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on implementation rates between SFY 2021–2022. Unlike in other sectors, many clean water practices implemented in the agricultural sector have an effective life of one year and require continued implementation year-after-year to sustain results. Additionally, agricultural practices are inherently subject to weather and soil conditions for the season and thus fluctuating levels of implementation are based on farm business decisions, landowner willingness, and ability to implement.

        "Explanation of Table 6 Extensive work to complete Stream Geomorphic Assessments and River Corridor Plans occurred in the early 2000s, resulting in a substantial amount of data in most watersheds across the state and a limited need to complete additional assessments in recent years. Ongoing work to develop tools and resources to streamline these processes will support targeted re-assessments in priority areas of the state. Most natural resource restoration projects reflected in this report are voluntary, and results may vary year-to-year depending on landowner willingness to participate, partner capacity, the timing of reporting, and other factors. Landowner outreach and investment in partner capacity to complete these types of projects is a crucial component to continued progress in clean water work in the natural resource sector. Annual variation in the level of project outputs reported is also partially attributable to some project types in the natural resource sector requiring multi-year planning and design work, legal agreements, and partner coordination. Figure 17: During (left) and after (right) removal of the Dunklee Pond dam. Removal of this 75-foot-long concrete dam reconnected 13 stream miles of the Tenney Brook, a tributary to East Creek in Rutland, Vermont. Removal of dams that are no longer actively used provides important water quality benefits — it allows river reaches to return to a natural process of evolution, reduces sediment transport to receiving waters, improves aquatic habitat, and increases flood resilience. The removal of this dam was funded by the Department of Environmental Conservation in partnership with the Vermont Natural Resources Council. The project was completed in the spring of 2022. Figure 18: The Lake Champlain TMDL Phase 1 Implementation Plan highlights forests as an important area for reducing phosphorus loading to state waters, representing 75% of Vermont’s total land base. Inadequate infrastructure is one cause of erosion on state forestland. Replacement of infrastructure not only reduces phosphorus loading to waterbodies, but also improves stream habitat and maintains public access for recreation and logging operations. This project included replacement of an undersized and collapsed cross drainage culvert (before, left) with an appropriately sized, aligned culvert (after, right) on a forest road in Mount Mansfield State Forest, located within the Lake Champlain basin.

In recent years, these efforts have begun to level out as assessments have covered most areas of the state and the focus has shifted to implementation of identified projects. State-funded non-regulatory stormwater treatment practices have treated over 550 acres of existing impervious surfaces since SFY 2016. Operational stormwater permits require treatment of runoff from new development or redevelopment of a certain size, and have historically not been funded with state dollars.38 However, the Three-Acre Rule will compel many sites with existing impervious surfaces to obtain operational stormwater permits and treat runoff from existing impervious surfaces, known as the Three-Acre General Permit. The state is developing funding programs to support landowners subject to the Three-Acre General Permit requirements. Data on these programs will be reflected in future reports. Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permits require designated urbanized communities to manage stormwater discharges from those areas. MS4 communities can receive partial funding and/or loan financing for the implementation of MS4 projects that address existing untreated or under-treated impervious surface. Since SFY 2016, over 1,000 acres of new and nearly 900 acres of existing impervious surface subject to regulatory requirements under MS4 and operational stormwater permits have been permitted and require treatment to the state standards.39 See Appendix D: Results of State Stormwater Regulations for more information on stormwater permit outputs. To comply with the Municipal Roads General Permit (MRGP), municipalities were required to submit initial Road Erosion Inventories (REIs) by the end of 2020. The number of hydrologically connected (adjacent to or intersecting surface waters) municipal road miles inventoried in each state fiscal year illustrates that permit compliance deadline, with the majority of road miles inventoried between SFY 2017–2021. REIs have covered over 6,000 hydrologically connected municipal road miles as of SFY 2023. Vermont has approximately 6,500 miles of roads that fall under the MRGP’s jurisdiction. Since SFY 2016, the Municipal Roads Grants-in-Aid Program and VTrans Better Roads Program have funded projects resulting in over 360 miles of municipal road drainage and erosion control improvements, and replaced nearly 1,000 municipal road drainage and stream culverts to improve road runoff for water quality. 38 Some of the funding programs established under Act 76 of 2019, described in Appendix A, will provide funding to support regulatory permit compliance under several programs that require treatment of existing impervious surfaces, such as the Three- Acre General Permit. 39 Results associated with regulatory operational stormwater permits are reported at the time of permit obtainment, and permittees have five years to complete the required treatment practice(s) under the permit. 39",

Some projects improve treatment within facilities, while others may provide community wastewater solutions to address failed or failing septic systems in designated village centers. State grants and low interest loans capitalized through the Vermont and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) finance municipal wastewater improvements. Wastewater treatment facility upgrades are extremely expensive and are typically only pursued when compelled by a regulatory requirement. Functioning wastewater treatment facilities may require upgrades to expand treatment capacity, which may not be necessary if capacity is sufficient to treat anticipated inflows. Figure 20: One of three wastewater treatment facilities operated by the City of Burlington. The city has partnered with the State of Vermont to finance several municipal wastewater treatment facility improvements and combined sewer overflow abatement projects. Financing this work has been possible in part by the low interest loans available through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. 41 A refurbished wastewater treatment facility refers to a facility with improvements or renovations that enable it to continue to efficiently operate. 42 An upgraded wastewater treatment facility refers to a facility with increased treatment capacity. 42",
        "Cost Effectiveness of State Clean Water Investments The previous section of this report summarizes the results of state-funded clean water projects completed from SFY 2016 to SFY 2023. Given the significant costs of restoring and protecting water quality, the state must efficiently and effectively spend its resources. The cost effectiveness of clean water projects is expressed as state dollars invested per kilogram of estimated total phosphorus load reduction over the anticipated lifespan of the project. If projects are maintained beyond their anticipated lifespan, the cost effectiveness of the project improves. Cost effectiveness can only be calculated for project types where estimated total phosphorus load reductions and cost data are available at the project level. Local- and federal-leveraged funds associated with state-funded projects are not included in the calculation of cost effectiveness of state investments. The figure and table below summarize the cost effectiveness of state investments in reducing phosphorus pollution by sector. 43 Transportation Related Natural Resources Stormwater Figure 21: Dollars invested per estimated kilogram of total phosphorus load reduced over the effective lifespan of each project type, based on clean water projects funded through State of Vermont agencies completed in SFY 2016–2023.44 43 Cost effectiveness data is presented in real dollars adjusted to the end of SFY 2023 for comparison purposes.

The key is to target funds to the most cost-effective projects within each land use sector. The State of Vermont employs science-based assessments to identify and prioritize projects and incorporates those prioritized actions in Tactical Basin Plans. The figure and table above show the distribution of cost effectiveness across four land use sectors where project level cost and phosphorus reduction data required to calculate cost effectiveness are available. Clean water projects in the agricultural and natural resources sectors included in this analysis are among the most cost-effective practices in terms of dollars invested per unit of estimated phosphorus pollution reduced. In the agricultural sector, practices such as conservation tillage, cover crop, and manure injection are highly cost-effective annual practices, but must be implemented each year to sustain pollution reduction results. Forested riparian buffers are also highly cost-effective, and have a 10 to 20-year lifespan, which results in more sustained phosphorus reduction compared to annual agricultural field and pasture projects. Note that riparian buffers on agricultural lands are included 44",
        "under agricultural pollution prevention practices, while buffers planted on all other land uses are considered natural resources restoration projects. The State will account for pollutant reductions in other natural resources projects, such as stream and floodplain restoration, in future years. Stormwater and transportation infrastructure projects tend to be more expensive per unit of estimated phosphorus pollution reduced. Stormwater practices are generally engineered structural practices that can incur high construction costs, but these practices are necessary to achieve required reductions from developed lands and have relatively long lifespans, achieving phosphorus load reductions for 20 years or more, if properly maintained. The large range in the cost effectiveness of road practices may be a result of some municipalities remediating the highest priority, most complex road segments (and therefore most expensive road segments) first to comply with the Municipal Roads General Permit (MRGP). Additionally, road project cost and complexity can vary based on what practices need to be installed to bring a road segment up to MRGP standards. 45",
        "Chapter 3: Clean Water Investments and TMDL Progress in the Lake Champlain Basin Lake Champlain TMDL Lake Champlain is one of the largest lakes in North America and its watershed drains nearly half the land area of Vermont, as well as portions of northeastern New York and southern Québec. Phosphorus levels in some portions of Lake Champlain regularly exceed Vermont’s water quality standards, which contributes to cyanobacteria blooms, low dissolved oxygen concentration, impaired aquatic life, and reduced recreational use. The Lake Champlain restoration plan, Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Loads for Vermont Segments of Lake Champlain (Lake Champlain TMDL), identifies phosphorus load reductions that must be achieved in all 12 segments of Lake Champlain to meet State of Vermont water quality standards.45 Total phosphorus loading to Lake Champlain from Vermont was modeled to be 630.6 metric tons per year during the TMDL baseline period of 2001 to 2010.

        "financial assistance levels, and the capacity of agencies and partners to administer funds, implement projects, and report outcomes. The following paragraphs provide some context to explain TMDL implementation progress by sector. The estimated phosphorus reductions achieved to date in the agricultural sector are mostly from annual field practices, such as cover crops, reduced- or no-till, and manure injection. Most of the phosphorus reductions required in the agricultural sector are tied to croplands, meaning that annual field practices are necessary to implement the TMDL. Annual practices must be implemented every year to sustain phosphorus reductions. Implementation of annual practices is dependent on land management decisions that can be influenced by a variety of farm business factors. This year, the data suggest a slight slowdown in phosphorus reductions associated with annual practices. This is likely the result of a combination of factors, including: • Some practices can only be implemented for a limited number of years to be eligible for cost share. Many programs are also subject to funding caps, which may limit the reported acres of practice implementation. • Many farms implement agricultural conservation practices without the support of cost share programs. The State is limited in its ability to capture the water quality benefits of practices implemented outside cost share programs, and only some of these data are presented in this report. • The multi-year federal Farm Bill governs much of the funding available to support agricultural practice implementation. Funds are often limited near the end of a Farm Bill cycle. The most recent Farm Bill was passed in 2018 and is set to expire at the end of calendar year 2023. • Agricultural water quality programs have recently expanded in focus and emphasis to include holistic planning and implementation on farms, the results of which may not be fully reflected in available data. In the natural resources sector, the increase in previously reported phosphorus reductions across all state fiscal years is largely attributable to incorporation of new phosphorus reduction accounting methods to capture the water quality benefits associated with the State of Vermont’s Use Value Appraisal (UVA) Program on forestland parcels.48 Forestland parcels that are actively enrolled in the UVA Program and have been inspected for program compliance meet Vermont’s Acceptable Management Practices (AMPs), a set of forestland management criteria designed to maintain and protect water quality.49 Newly established phosphorus accounting methods for other practices in the natural resources sector are in the process of being implemented, and will be reflected in future years of reporting. These new methods will be applied to newly completed projects, as well as applied to fill gaps for previously completed projects as data availability allows. Estimated phosphorus reductions in the stormwater and transportation related stormwater land use sectors have been incrementally growing. This progress is associated with increased implementation of several regulatory programs designed to 48 For details on phosphorus accounting for UVA parcels, please see the Standard Operating Procedures for Tracking & Accounting of Natural Resources Restoration Projects: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/cwi/projects/tracking- accounting#SOP 49 Phosphorus reductions are only accounting for forestland parcels that enrolled in the UVA program after the TMDL baseline periods. 49",

Operational stormwater permits regulate stormwater discharges resulting from new development, redevelopment, and three-acre sites. Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permits regulate stormwater discharges in the most populous regions of the state. The Municipal Roads General Permit (MRGP) regulates stormwater related erosion on municipally owned roads. Regulatory programs are at varying stages of implementation, and continued expansion of compliance will increase estimated phosphorus reductions in future years.50 In the Lake Champlain basin, the change in pace of estimated annual phosphorus reduction progress seen in the data available for SFY 2022 and 2023 may be in part a reflection of the completion of relatively easy to implement projects. Now that many of the low-hanging projects have largely been implemented, identification and implementation of projects that are in some cases more complex and involved, will need to be completed to reach Vermont’s water quality goals in the basin. The variability of implementation rates across years also underscores the importance of investing in program and partner capacity to broaden the reach and impact of clean water project implementation. 50 For more information on regulatory stormwater programs in Vermont, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/stormwater/permit-information-applications-fees 50",

Explanation of Figure 25 The progress made toward reaching Lake Champlain’s phosphorus reduction target has increased since SFY 2016, however progress has slowed in recent years (see explanation of Figure 24 for more context on rate of progress). State, federal, and regulatory clean water programs have reduced an estimated 41.5 metric tons of phosphorus loading delivered to Lake Champlain in SFY 2023, which represents approximately 20 percent of the required reduction. This result is expected to increase in the coming years for at least the following reasons: 1.

        "implementation across sectors.51 While many of these funding programs and capacity initiatives are underway, the results of these investments will not be fully reflected in estimated phosphorus reductions until projects are completed, which may take multiple years. 2. The State of Vermont has been building and expanding clean water regulatory, financial, and technical assistance programs since SFY 2016. Many regulatory programs are now in place that will drive phosphorus reductions from agricultural and developed lands. In some cases, the results of these regulatory programs have yet to be reflected in project-level reported data. For example, under the Three-Acre General Permit, landowners are in the process of obtaining permit coverage near term, and construction of appropriate treatment is required within five years of permit authorization. 3. The State has published methods for quantifying phosphorus reductions for agricultural, natural resources, and developed lands sector clean water practices. New methods were recently established to fill gaps in capturing the phosphorus reduction benefit of several practices, particularly in the natural resources sector. These new methods are in the process of being implemented and will be reflected in future years of reporting for newly completed projects, as well as applied to fill gaps for prior completed projects. Lake Champlain TMDL Progress by Lake Segment Watershed The Lake Champlain TMDL allocates total phosphorus load reduction targets by lake segment watershed, which differ slightly from the boundaries of Tactical Planning Basins.

Lake segment size and level of phosphorus reduction required varies: The TMDL allocated phosphorus loading capacity based on each lake segment’s land use and in-lake characteristics and the reduction required to meet Vermont water quality standards. The level of effort required and the magnitude of phosphorus loading ranges by lake segment. 2. Clean water projects are targeted in priority watersheds: Tactical Basin Plans inform where to prioritize efforts for reducing phosphorus loading to Lake Champlain. The level of progress in the Northeast Arm and St. Albans Bay lake segments is relatively high, as USDA-NRCS has targeted significant agricultural technical and financial assistance to these watersheds. 3. New phosphorus reduction methodology: The State has published methods for quantifying phosphorus reductions for agricultural, natural resources, and developed lands sector clean water practices. Lake segments dominated by agricultural efforts show greater progress than lake segments targeting natural resources restoration because there are currently more comprehensive systems to quantify estimated reductions for agricultural projects compared to other sectors. 52 To view a map of the lake segment watersheds, see page 3 of the Lake Champlain TMDL, available at: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/restoring/champlain 53",

During the baseline period, measured total annual phosphorus loading from wastewater treatment facilities was well below the wasteload allocation (maximum permitted phosphorus limit) of 55.8 metric tons that was established under the 2002 Lake Champlain TMDL. The updated 2016 Lake Champlain TMDL for Vermont reduced the wastewater treatment facility wasteload allocation from 55.8 to 32.3 metric tons, which is intended to achieve the overall required phosphorus load allocation while allowing for some development and growth over the TMDL implementation timeframe.

        "Chapter 4: Clean Water Investments and TMDL Progress in the Lake Memphremagog Basin Lake Memphremagog TMDL Lake Memphremagog is an international waterbody with the majority of its watershed area in Vermont and a small portion in Québec. The Vermont portion of the watershed covers most of Orleans County including the three major lake tributaries: the Black, Barton, and Clyde Rivers, as well as the smaller Johns River. The Lake Memphremagog watershed is part of the larger Tactical Basin Planning region (Basin 17), which also includes the Tomifobia and Coaticook River basins that drain into Québec (Figure 28). Land use within the Vermont portion of the Lake Memphremagog watershed is largely forest or shrub with about 17 percent in agriculture, and five percent in developed lands.54 Phosphorus levels in the Vermont portion of Lake Memphremagog are higher than the water quality standard set for the lake. Elevated levels of phosphorus contribute to intermittent cyanobacteria blooms but also support excessive plant and algae growth that limits the quality of the lake for recreational use. The Lake Memphremagog TMDL was established in 2017 to specify the maximum amount of Figure 28: Map of Vermont phosphorus that the waterbody can receive and still meet with the Lake applicable water quality standards and establish targets for Memphremagog, Tomifobia, reducing phosphorus loading to the lake from its watershed. and Coaticook Rivers Total phosphorus loading to Lake Memphremagog from Vermont Tactical Basin Planning was modeled to be 52.7 metric tons per year during the TMDL region (Basin 17) highlighted baseline period of 2009 to 2012.

The Lake Memphremagog, Tomifobia, and Coaticook Tactical Basin Plan (Basin 17) was updated in 2023. It provides an assessment of the health of the basin and defines ongoing and future strategies to address high-priority surface water stressors.56 The purpose of the plan is to identify actions necessary to meet or exceed state water quality standards, and to achieve sustained ecological health and human use of surface waters.

From SFY 2016 to 2020, the greatest investments in the basin occurred in the developed lands and agriculture sectors. There was a large increase in natural resources funding in SFY 2021 due to the conservation of 129 acres of waterfront land at Bluffside Farm on Lake Memphremagog in Newport. This $1.4 million project was funded by a Clean Water State Revolving Fund Land Conservation Interim Financing Loan provided to Vermont Land Trust.

        "nearly twenty-fold from SFY 2016 to 2023. In recent reporting years, the pace of estimated phosphorus reduction progress has slowed. Changing rates of progress over the 20-year implementation timeframe are to be expected and are associated with swings in financial assistance levels, as well as the capacity of agencies and partners to administer funds, implement projects, and report outcomes. The following paragraphs provide some context to explain estimated phosphorus reductions reported by sector to date. The estimated phosphorus reductions in the agricultural sector are largely from the implementation of annual field practices, such as cover crops, reduced- or no-till, and manure injection. Most of the phosphorus reductions required in the agricultural sector are tied to croplands, meaning that annual field practices are necessary to implement the TMDL. Annual practices must be implemented every year to sustain phosphorus reductions. Implementation of annual practices is dependent on land management decisions that can be influenced by a variety of farm business factors. This year, the data suggest a slight slowdown in phosphorus reductions associated with annual practices. This is likely the result of a combination of factors, including: • Some practices can only be implemented for a limited number of years to be eligible for cost share. Many programs are also subject to funding caps, which may limit the reported acres of practice implementation. • Many farms implement agricultural conservation practices without the support of cost share programs. The State is limited in its ability to capture the water quality benefits of practices implemented outside of cost share programs, and only some of these data are presented in this report. • The multi-year federal Farm Bill governs much of the funding available to support agricultural practice implementation. Funds are often limited near the end of a Farm Bill cycle. The most recent Farm Bill was passed in 2018 and is set to expire at the end of calendar year 2023. • Agricultural water quality programs have recently expanded in focus and emphasis to include holistic planning and implementation on farms, the results of which may not be fully reflected in available data. In the natural resources sector, the increase in previously reported phosphorus reductions across all state fiscal years is largely attributable to incorporation of new phosphorus reduction accounting methods to capture the water quality benefits associated with the State of Vermont’s Use Value Appraisal (UVA) Program on forestland parcels.60 Forestland parcels that are actively enrolled in the UVA Program and have been inspected for program compliance meet Vermont’s Acceptable Management Practices (AMPs), a set of forestland management criteria designed to maintain and protect water quality.61 Newly established phosphorus accounting methods for other practices in the natural resources sector are in the process of being implemented, and will be reflected in future years of reporting. These new methods will be applied to newly 60 For details on phosphorus accounting for UVA parcels, please see the Standard Operating Procedures for Tracking & Accounting of Natural Resources Restoration Projects: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/cwi/projects/tracking- accounting#SOP 61 Phosphorus reductions are only accounting for forestland parcels that enrolled in the UVA program after the TMDL baseline periods. 59",
        "completed projects, as well as applied to fill gaps for previously completed projects as data availability allows. Estimated phosphorus reductions in the stormwater and transportation related stormwater land use sectors are contributing an increasing proportion of total estimated phosphorus reductions in recent years. This progress can be attributed to increased implementation of several regulatory programs designed to reduce and mitigate stormwater pollution from developed lands and roads. In the stormwater sector, operational stormwater permits regulate stormwater discharges caused by new development, redevelopment, and three-acre sites. In the transportation related stormwater sector, the Municipal Roads General Permit (MRGP) regulates stormwater related erosion on municipally owned roads. Regulatory programs are at varying stages of implementation, and continued expansion of compliance will increase estimated phosphorus reductions in future years.62 In the Lake Memphremagog basin, it is likely that the slowing trend of estimated annual phosphorus reduction progress is in part a reflection of early adoption of easy to implement, ready to construct projects. As implementation of the TMDL continues, identification and implementation of additional projects, including in some cases more complex and involved projects, will need to be completed to continue working towards reaching Vermont’s water quality goals in the basin. The variability of implementation rates across years also underscores the importance of investing in program and partner capacity to broaden the reach and impact of clean water project implementation. 62 For more information on regulatory stormwater programs in Vermont, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/stormwater/permit-information-applications-fees 60",

        "Chapter 5: Connecticut River Basin Clean Water Investments and Results Long Island Sound TMDL The Connecticut River is New England’s longest river. It runs through four states: Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. Seven Tactical Planning Basins in the eastern half of the State of Vermont drain to the Connecticut River, which eventually drains to the Long Island Sound. The Long Island Sound is a large estuary that drains a total watershed of over 16,000 square miles, including the Connecticut River as well as areas of Rhode Island and New York according to the Long Island Sound TMDL (Figure 33).64 The Long Island Sound is impaired due to nitrogen, which can cause cyanobacteria blooms and hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column) leading to “dead zones” that threaten marine life. To address the excess nitrogen and resulting hypoxia, the EPA approved A Total Maximum Daily Load Analysis to Achieve Water Quality Standards for Dissolved Oxygen in Long Island Sound in 2001 to define the nitrogen reductions necessary to meet water quality standards in the Sound. Vermont's clean water efforts to restore, protect, and enhance water quality in the Connecticut River and its tributaries are also contributing to water quality progress for Figure 33: Map of the Long Island Long Island Sound.

EPA-supported efforts are underway to develop consistent methods for all five states covered under the Long Island Sound TMDL to estimate nitrogen reductions for clean water projects. Vermont will set a schedule to publish methods to account for nitrogen reductions in the Connecticut River basin to comply with Vermont’s Clean Water Service Delivery Act, Act 76 of 2019 (10 V.S.A. § 923) and to align with ongoing five state nitrogen tracking coordination efforts. 66",
        "Chapter 6: Context and Takeaways Water pollutants that enter Vermont’s waters, including nutrient and sediment pollution, can lead to local and regional water quality issues. Excess phosphorus loading can result in potentially harmful cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Champlain, Lake Memphremagog, and inland lakes around the state. Excess nitrogen loading contributes to low dissolved oxygen and dead zones in the Long Island Sound. Most sources of water pollution in Vermont are from nonpoint sources where rainfall and snowmelt carry pollution from the land surface into waterways. Due to the dispersed nature of nonpoint source pollution, realizing our water quality goals requires actions of various scales across all land uses to mitigate water pollution. The dispersed nature of pollution sources from the landscape also means that many external landscape-scale factors can affect the rate of progress. The success of this work also depends on the willingness of the public to adopt clean water projects and a well-supported, diverse network of partners to develop and implement projects. The following sections provide important context for interpreting results summarized in this report and the outlook for clean water progress in Vermont. Modeled vs. Measured The State of Vermont estimates pollutant reductions associated with clean water projects. Estimates are currently available for phosphorus reductions for projects located in the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog basins, summarized in Chapters 3 and 4 of this report. These modeled estimates provide an incremental measure of progress at the project-level, however, many landscape-level factors influence on-the-ground water quality conditions. Measured water quality through monitoring is the ultimate indicator of clean water progress— whether the goal is protection of high-quality waters or the restoration of impaired waters. The State of Vermont monitors water quality to assess the status and trends of its surface waters, posts data online, and reports the status of Vermont’s waters on a biennial basis.65 The State of Vermont also supports local monitoring initiatives through its LaRosa Partnership Program and participates in the Lake Champlain Basin Program’s Long Term Monitoring Project to monitor the water quality conditions of Lake Champlain, including the status and trends of phosphorus loading.66,67 Monitoring data and water quality status and trends are integrated into State of Vermont Tactical Basin Plans, which inform clean water funding and project implementation strategies. Tactical Basin Plans employ an adaptive management approach by considering measures of clean water project progress, water quality status and trends, and changes in land use conditions impacting water quality. Factors Influencing Water Quality Progress The state and federal funding programs and regulatory programs summarized in this report are designed to restore, enhance, and protect water quality, but there are many landscape-scale 65 Visit the Department of Environmental Conservation’s Monitoring and Assessment webpage for more information, available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/map 66 Visit the LaRosa Partnership Program webpage for more information, available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/map/monitor/larosa 67 Visit the Lake Champlain Long Term Monitoring Project webpage for more information, available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/lakes-ponds/monitor/lake-champlain 67",
        "factors beyond our control that influence progress in reaching our water quality goals. Climate change and historical pollution are two primary challenges influencing water quality progress. In addition to landscape-level factors, the success of our clean water efforts depends on the capacity of Vermont’s clean water workforce to develop, implement, and maintain projects. The following sections explain how these factors influence the outputs and outcomes summarized in this report. Climate Change Climate change’s impact on temperature and precipitation patterns affects water quality. This underscores the importance of continued assessment of water quality progress through monitoring data and consideration for external factors that may be impacting measured outcomes. Data for the past several decades show long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation, and the risks of severe weather in Vermont.68 As climate change continues, it is important to understand the impacts on Vermont and its waters — namely climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of storms and flooding events and increasing air and water temperatures. Above average pollutant loads resulting from flood events and high temperatures can also increase the incidence and severity of cyanobacteria blooms. Climate Change and Cyanobacteria Blooms Climate change is predicted to affect several key factors that regulate cyanobacteria growth — temperature, nutrient availability, and water stability. Warmer summer temperatures and shorter, warmer winters will increase the length of time that cyanobacteria can proliferate each year. The cyanobacteria monitoring program on Lake Champlain since 2003 has documented that blooms are occurring earlier in the summer and persisting later into the fall. The monitoring season now begins about two weeks earlier than it did in 2003 and recent data show blooms occurring into mid-October. Scientists in Vermont and elsewhere are noting the incidence of cyanobacteria blooms at lower than expected phosphorus concentrations, indicating that the factors noted above may contribute to the incidence of bloom condition. The State of Vermont will have little control over global factors that drive climate change-related weather patterns and precipitation. Therefore, Vermont will need to continue its focus on land-use management and control of nutrient pollution loading to surface waters to reduce the impact of cyanobacteria blooms. Climate Change and Increased Precipitation Climate data indicate statistically significant increase in frequency of intense storms and annual total precipitation since 1940. Water quality monitoring shows that storm events often correlate with peaks in sediment and nutrient loading to lakes. For example, phosphorus readily binds to soil, and when soil erodes into our waters, it carries phosphorus with it. Change in precipitation patterns may increase water pollution by increasing: • Erosion of unstable road networks; • Erosion and hazards of unstable river and streambanks; • Erosion of lakeshores; • Volume of runoff from agricultural fields and production areas; 68 Vermont Climate Action Office (CAO) website: https://climatechange.vermont.gov/ 68",
        "• Volume of stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces, such as roads, parking lots, and rooftops; and • Incidents of combined sewer overflows. The summer 2023 flood events demonstrated the harms of climate-driven increased precipitation on Vermont’s communities and environment. Heavy, prolonged rainfall resulted in major flooding statewide. Three to nine inches of rainfall was observed across the state over a 48-hour period in July.69 Streams and rivers rose quickly — high waters and flood hazards led to displacement of people, infrastructure failure, property damage, crop loss, and peaks in water pollution. High flow events like this deliver significant amounts of sediment and other pollutants to waterways.70 In the hours and days following a severe flooding event, temporary reductions in water quality and high measurements of sediment and phosphorus in waters are expected. Longer term, this type of event delivers large amounts of phosphorus laden sediments, which settle to the lake bottom and can contribute to internal phosphorus loading in subsequent years. Climate-driven changes in precipitation patterns highlight the importance of climate adaptation and flood resilience. Clean water projects support climate adaptation and flood resilience in many ways, including projects that: • Protect and restore natural resources, such as wetlands, floodplains, and lakeshores, to slow down, spread out, and soak up floodwaters; • Implement agricultural field practices to improve soil health, water infiltration, and carbon sequestration; • Manage large forestland blocks to protect biodiversity, sequester carbon, and mitigate flood related erosion; • Use updated road, bridge, and culvert design standards that are able to withstand higher river and stream flows and more intense storms; • Implement Stormwater Management Manual standards to emphasize the importance of infiltrating stormwater runoff from developed lands into soils; and • Invest in wastewater infrastructure improvements to reduce flood related damage and limit the occurrence and severity of combined sewer overflow events. It is important to consider climate change’s impact on Vermont’s clean water work when evaluating progress. Uncertainty in how climate change will influence pollution delivered to waterways is incorporated into pollution reduction targets articulated in large-scale nutrient TMDLs.71 There are reasons to be hopeful that Vermont can meet its water quality goals despite climate change with sustained effort and investment. The more clean water projects implemented, the more resilient our waterways will be to extreme weather events and floods, which also protects Vermont’s communities and built infrastructure from flood hazards. Realizing our water quality goals requires sustained investment and will continue to yield multiple benefits, including climate adaptation and flood resilience. 69 National Weather Service: https://www.weather.gov/btv/The-Great-Vermont-Flood-of-10-11-July-2023-Preliminary- Meteorological-Summary 70 Lake Champlain Basin Program: https://www.lcbp.org/our-goals/thriving-communities/flooding/2023-flooding/ 71 The Lake Champlain TMDL model simulated climate change scenarios and added a five percent margin of safety to each lake segment’s loading capacity to address the likely increases in phosphorus loading from climate change, while the Lake Memphremagog model added an eight percent margin of safety. 69",
        "Legacy (Historical) Pollution Sources Clean water investments primarily address external loading, which is pollution originating from the land surface, to minimize the volume of nutrients and sediment deposited into adjacent waterways. Sediments and nutrients like phosphorus tend to accumulate at the bottom of lakes. When phosphorus in lakebed sediments moves into the water column, it is called internal loading.72 Vermont’s long history of logging and agriculture as two dominant land management approaches have resulted in a build-up of legacy phosphorus in lake systems that contributes to internal loading. As a result, in some lakes, a substantial lag time between the implementation of clean water projects and the realization of measurable water quality improvements is expected. This highlights the importance of sustained efforts to minimize additional nutrient and sediment pollution to ensure long term health of Vermont’s waters. In some cases, addressing internal loading from legacy phosphorus concentrations may be needed in combination with continued work to mitigate external loading to achieve desired water quality outcomes and reduce the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms. Vermont’s Clean Water Workforce Vermont’s work to improve water quality is led by and relies upon a network of partner organizations and project implementers who: • Participate in clean water project planning and identification efforts; • Host clean water projects on their property; • Provide and/or administer clean water funding; • Complete clean water project work, including development, design, implementation, and maintenance; and • Report back to the state on the outcomes of projects. 72 James, W.

        "State Agencies Landowners, Farmers Residents, & Volunteers Clean Water Engineers & Municipalities Technical Partner Consultants Network Funding Program Construction & Administrators Implementaion & Project Leads Managers Federal Partners Figure 35: Clean Water Partners in Vermont Recent unprecedented increases in state and federal funding for clean water efforts, combined with a need to increase the pace of progress to meet clean water goals, necessitates growth in the workforce’s capacity. The success of the Clean Water Initiative and clean water projects across land use sectors requires the network of partners to be numerous, diverse, well-trained, and well-resourced. For many years, the Lake Champlain Basin Program and the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets have invested in partner capacity focused on the clean water network, although the focus has been limited geographically, or to the agricultural sector. In 2023, the Agency of Natural Resources joined this effort by launching its own Clean Water Workforce Capacity Development Initiative. The results and impacts of these collective investments in capacity development will be reflected in future years of this report. Outlook for Reaching Vermont’s Water Quality Goals Continued effort, investment, capacity building, and coordination are critical to the state reaching its water quality goals. The state is making a substantial investment in clean water projects that yield many additional benefits, including flood resilience and climate adaptation. Maintaining the 71",
        "level of clean water investment and regulation is critical to reach our water quality goals, as it will take time for impaired waterways to recover after decades of excess pollution. Trends in reported outputs and outcomes are expected to increase in the coming years for the following reasons: • State funding programs at DEC have shifted to block grant structures that rely on regional partners to manage and administer funding of individual projects. The transition to regional administration of clean water funding is anticipated to empower community partners, reduce bottlenecks, and increase the impact of clean water investments. • Vermont has received an influx in federal funding under ARPA, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as increased Clean Water Fund revenue enacted under Act 76 of 2019. Program expansion supported by this funding will drive clean water project implementation across sectors. • The State of Vermont has been expanding clean water regulatory, financial, and technical assistance programs since SFY 2016. Many regulatory programs are now in place that will drive meaningful progress in the agriculture and developed lands sectors. • Throughout this report, there are areas where capacity constraints are resulting in lags in clean water investments, project work, and reported results. Indirect investments in network capacity are expected to mitigate some of these lag times and increase the rate of progress. • The State is expanding its ability to fully capture results in its tracking and reporting, such as estimating phosphorus reductions for additional project types in the natural resources sector. Enhanced tracking and reporting will provide a more complete picture of progress on the ground. This report serves as a useful tool to provide accountability on the state’s clean water progress and to inform adaptive management. By taking an adaptive management approach, the state will continue to identify and prioritize its resources to break down barriers to project implementation and clean water progress. Clean water project implementation is an important piece of climate resilience work and clean water projects have co-benefits like increased flood resilience, improved carbon sequestration, better soil health, and improved habitat function and biodiversity. In addition to achieving water quality goals, Vermont’s work to improve water quality directly supports climate adaptation and flood mitigation, which will increase the state’s resilience to future climate related stressors. 72",
        "Appendix A: Act 76 of 2019 Vermont’s Clean Water Service Delivery Act Act 76 of 2019 established a water quality project delivery framework to support Vermont’s clean water goals and secured a new long-term funding source for the Clean Water Fund. Act 76 established four complementary grant programs intended to support implementation of the Clean Water Initiative by addressing sources of pollution through both regulatory and non- regulatory mechanisms: Water Quality Restoration Formula Grants, Water Quality Enhancement Grants, Municipal Stormwater Implementation Grants, and Developed Lands Implementation Grants.73 Act 76 also continues support for other Clean Water Fund priorities, such as Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets’ water quality grants to partners and farmers. The grant programs created under Act 76 began in state fiscal year (SFY) 2023 and funding associated with these programs is integrated into the statewide funding totals presented in Chapter 2. Annual funding levels for all four grant programs established under Act 76 are set by the Clean Water Board through the annual Clean Water Budget development process.74 The following sections summarize the administration of these funding programs. Data are being collected on the funding and outcomes of these grant programs to assess adequacy of funding levels. Currently, these grant programs are adequately funding the implementation of the Clean Water Initiative factoring the recent influx of federal funds and capacity available in the network to implement this work. No change is recommended at this time to the Water Quality Enhancement Grants funding limit. The State will continue to assess the adequacy of funding and report an annual recommendation. Water Quality Restoration Formula Grant Program Act 76 established regional organizations called Clean Water Service Providers (CWSPs) for each Tactical Planning Basin in the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog basins. CWSPs are responsible for partnering with Basin Water Quality Councils and project implementers to oversee the identification, funding, implementation, operation, and maintenance of non-regulatory clean water projects to meet non-regulatory phosphorus reduction targets with funding provided through the Water Quality Restoration Formula Grant Program. Water Quality Restoration Formula Grants are awarded annually to each CWSP. Formula Grants funds are allocated based on the Water Quality Restoration Formula Grant Targets and Fund Allocation Methodology. The Fund Allocation Methodology considers the annual pollutant reduction allocation established for the CWSP multiplied by the standard cost for pollutant reduction, with phosphorus reduction allocations and award values scaled down to available funds.75 The standard cost for pollution reduction is determined by project type category, and 73 Act 76 of 2019 as enacted is available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/statues-rules-policies/act-76/law-rule- guidance 74 For more information on the Clean Water Board and Budget process, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/water- investment/cwi/board 75 To learn more about and view the Water Quality Restoration Formula Grant Targets and Fund Allocation Methodology, visit: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/statues-rules-policies/act-76/resources The Methodology will be refined periodically by ANR-DEC as improved information and data become available. 73",
        "includes the costs of project design and construction. Pollution reduction allocations are further downsized to make room in the awards to cover costs associated with administration, reporting, and project identification, development, inspection, verification, operation, and maintenance (O&M). O&M of clean water projects ensures installed practices continue to contribute phosphorus reductions for the duration of the project’s functional life. Total Formula Grant estimated need based on phosphorus reduction targets will be further refined in future Clean Water Budget cycles, with continued collection of data on project costs related to project outputs/phosphorus reductions. ANR-DEC will continue to work with O&M partners to improve O&M cost estimates and establish quantitative budget targets in future years. Eligible non-regulatory clean water project types that can be funded under Water Quality Restoration Formula Grants are described in the ANR-DEC Clean Water Initiative Program’s (CWIP) Funding Policy.76 This includes projects across a range of sectors including floodplain and stream restoration, buffer plantings, stormwater management improvements, wetlands restoration, and lake shoreline restoration. CWSPs and their Basin Water Quality Councils will be responsible for determining how Formula Grant funds are awarded at the project-level, within their respective basins, using state-derived Guidance. Water Quality Restoration Formula Grants are administered by the ANR-DEC CWIP with technical project management from the ANR-DEC Watershed Planning Program (WPP). Water Quality Enhancement Grant Program The statutory intent of the Water Quality Enhancement Grant Program established through Act 76 is to protect high quality waters, maintain or improve water quality, restore degraded or stressed waters, create resilient watersheds and communities, and support the public’s use and enjoyment of the state’s waters. This is achieved in SFY 2023 through administration of a set of sub-initiatives such as: Dam Removal Design and Implementation Block Grant, Woody Riparian Buffer Block Grant, River Corridor Easements, Multi-Sector Assessments, Enhancement Development, Design & Implementation Block Grant, and Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) Wetland Incentives. Enhancement Grant Program sub-initiatives vary in structure between grants or contracts depending on the scope of work, and some funding is administered, allocated, and awarded at the project-level by a Funding Program Administrator through a block grant structure. The intent of the Water Quality Enhancement Grant Program suite of sub-initiatives is to support the life cycle of projects from identification to development through implementation. Eligible non-regulatory clean water project types that can be funded under Water Quality Enhancement Grants are described in the ANR-DEC Clean Water Initiative Program’s (CWIP) Funding Policy.76 This includes projects across a range of sectors including floodplain and stream restoration, buffer plantings, stormwater management improvements, wetlands restoration, and lake shoreline restoration. The Water Quality Enhancement Grants minimum funding level is 20 percent of the annual balance of the Clean Water Fund, provided that the maximum amount recommended shall not exceed $5,000,000. The SFY 2023 budget funded this grant category at the full $5,000,000 maximum. 76 The CWIP Funding Policy is available here: https://dec.vermont.gov/water-investment/cwi/grants 74",
        "Water Quality Enhancement Grants are administered by the ANR-DEC CWIP with technical project management from the ANR-DEC CWIP and the Watershed Management Division. Developed Lands Implementation Grant Program The Developed Lands Implementation Grant Program will provide grants or financing to support individuals required comply with stormwater regulatory requirements that are necessary to achieve water quality standards. The program will support Three-Acre General Permit obtainment and compliance through design and implementation. Initial funding to support this program is through American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) federal funds directly appropriated to ANR-DEC from SFY 2022 through 2024 which will be encumbered and expended through December 2026. Initial administration of these funds will be through DEC’s Three-Acre Permit Obtainment Assistance program, which will provide beneficiary payments to landowners to support the engineering and permitting costs associated with permit obtainment. Ultimately, a financing structure will replace ARPA programs to serve as the Developed Lands Implementation Grant Program, to be designed and administered by the ANR-DEC Water Infrastructure Finance Program. The Developed Lands Implementation Grant Program is initially administered and managed by the ANR-DEC CWIP but will transition to the ANR-DEC Water Infrastructure Finance Program as a financing structure is developed in the future. Municipal Stormwater Implementation Grant Program Act 76 established the Municipal Stormwater Implementation Grant Program to provide grants to municipalities to assist with their compliance efforts under regulatory stormwater permits. 10 V.S.A § 928 states: “The Secretary shall administer a Municipal Stormwater Implementation Grant Program to provide grants to any municipality required under section 1264 of this title to obtain or seek coverage under [1] the municipal roads general permit (MRGP), [2] the municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) permit, [3] a permit for impervious surface of three acres or more, or a permit required by the Secretary to reduce the adverse impacts to water quality of a discharge or stormwater runoff.” The statutory intent of the Municipal Stormwater Implementation Grant Program is met through several complementary initiatives. The Vermont Agency of Transportation’s (VTrans) Municipal Roads Grants-in-Aid and Municipal Better Roads programs will continue to support implementation of the Municipal Roads General Stormwater permit requirements ([1]). DEC’s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Community Formula Grant program will support implementation of the MS4 stormwater requirements ([2]). DEC’s Green Schools Initiative, DEC’s Three-Acre Public Private Partnership (P3), and DEC’s Three-Acre Permit Obtainment Assistance programs will support municipalities in meeting Three-Acre General Permit stormwater requirements ([3]) . MRGP sub-initiatives are administered and managed by VTrans. MS4 and Three-Acre Permit sub-initiatives are administered and managed by ANR-DEC CWIP. 75",
        "Appendix B: The Northern Lake Champlain Direct Drainages (Basin 5) TMDL Implementation 2023 Progress Report The Accountability Framework of the 2016 Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) for Vermont Segments of Lake Champlain ensures TMDL implementation moves forward at a steady rate. A major driver of the Accountability Framework is the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) development of basin-specific Tactical Basin Plans (TBP). The TBPs are developed on a five-year rotating basis and include Implementation Tables that identify priority actions needed to implement the TMDL. It is through review of the Implementation Tables, and the progress made in accomplishing the tasks that U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tracks implementation progress in each basin. To facilitate EPA’s evaluation of progress, DEC describes the status of each strategy midway through (2.5 years) and at the conclusion of the five-year planning cycle in interim and final report cards, respectively. Appendix B is the interim report card for the 2020 Northern Lake Champlain Direct Basin. The 2.5-year reporting period began in January 2021 coincident with the publication of the 2020 Northern Lake Champlain Direct Basin77 and goes through June 30, 2023. Data in this report align with this 2.5-year period (SFY 2021–SFY 2023) available through the Clean Water Reporting Framework (CWRF). Due to a change in the TBP development schedule, the Watershed Planning Program will be accelerating the development of the next iteration of the Northern Lake Champlain Direct Drainages (Basin 5) TBP to be completed by the end of 2024 instead of the end of 2025. As such, the reporting period for Basin 5 during this period will be curtailed from a 5-year period to a 4-year period, which will result in the final TBP Report Card issuance concurrent with the Clean Water Initiative 2024 Performance Report. It should be noted that the subsequent Basin 5 TBP development will then progress on a 5-year cycle going forward, and the next iteration of the Basin 5 TBP will be completed by the end of 2029 instead of 2030, along with the corresponding TMDL “phase 4” content and final report card for that next 5-year reporting period. The following sections describe progress towards completing strategies in the 2020 Northern Lake Champlain Direct TBP Implementation Table. Each strategy is organized by one of five major sectors – agriculture, developed lands, natural resources, forestry, and wastewater. Progress described for each strategy includes status (defined in Table B-1) as well as an explanation of actions taken. The explanation describes how the Agency and partners supported the strategy and resulting outcomes that together show that meaningful results were achieved. The outcomes include performance measures for Agency-supported assistance that were collected as part of the Accountability Framework (see Accountability Measures). Phosphorus reductions for the Northern Lake Champlain basin were estimated to have met about 31 percent of the basin’s total load reduction targets set by the TMDL, based on basin- 77 The 2020 Northern Lake Champlain Direct Drainages Tactical Basin Plan available at: https://dec.vermont.gov/water- investment/watershed-planning/tactical-basin-planning/basin5 76",

While this report card does not discuss trends in annual phosphorus reductions, estimated trends since SFY 2016 can be found by basin and by sector in the TMDL reduction estimates interactive online report. Trends and five-year phosphorus reduction targets will also be published and further discussed in the 2024 Basin 5 TBP’s Lake Champlain TMDL Phase 3, and any gaps will be noted in the final progress report. Basin 5 Update The 2020 TBP strategies were evaluated and their associated actions were assigned a status condition using the rationale described in Table B-1. Of the 53 strategies identified to date, 9 have been completed, 40 are ongoing, three are in progress, and one has not been started (Figure B-1). The likelihood of completion by the final progress report was evaluated as low, medium or high for the in progress and not started strategies. The ongoing strategies have to date achieved the expected results, but additional work is expected before the final progress report is submitted. Of the three actions that are in progress, all have a medium or high likelihood of being completed by 2024. The strategy that has not been started will most likely be replaced by another approach to meeting the same goal in the next iteration of the TBP and therefore has a low likelihood of completion as currently framed. The strategies with a high likelihood of being completed are those that have received funding and have a strong partner and local support. They are also farther along in the process. In addition, some strategies are regulatory and are required to be completed. Strategies that have a medium likelihood of completion have been initiated and may have received funding, but the end date for completion is beyond 2024. In many cases, medium likelihood strategies have support, but may lack funding or a partner to bring the project to fruition. These projects are next in line to be completed once the high likelihood actions are complete, which will free up capacity for partners that carry out the projects. Strategies with low likelihood of completion by 2024 are those that require significant funding and resources to complete. In some cases, support exists, and funding may be available, but a partner’s capacity to develop the associated action(s) is lacking. 77",

Most projects in progress have completed the first phase of action, for example, planning or discussions towards completion of the strategy have occurred with no barriers identified towards completion. As of SFY 2023, additional resources became available to support non-regulatory actions in the plan through the Clean Water Service Delivery Act (Act 76).78 The act will increasingly support the delivery of clean water services and increase regional capacity to develop and implement non regulatory projects. The Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission (CCRPC) is the Northern Lake Champlain basin Clean Water Service Provider. In SFY 2023 DEC awarded CCRPC a grant for $645,340 to achieve an annual phosphorus reduction target of 41.9kg by supporting the development, implementation, and maintenance of non-regulatory clean water projects. In SFY 2024, CVRPC received $741,808 to achieve an additional 45.1kg. Additional funding and phosphorus reduction targets will be provided each year of this initial CWSP assignment term through June 30, 2028.

        "Appendix C: Winooski River (Basin 8) TMDL Implementation 2023 Progress Report The Accountability Framework of the 2016 Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) for Vermont Segments of Lake Champlain ensures TMDL implementation moves forward at a steady rate. A major driver of the Accountability Framework is the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) development of basin-specific Tactical Basin Plans (TBP). TBPs are developed on a five-year rotating basis and include Implementation Tables that identify priority actions needed to implement the TMDL. It is through review of the Implementation Tables, and the progress made in accomplishing the tasks, that U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tracks implementation progress in each basin. To facilitate EPA’s evaluation of progress, DEC describes the status of each strategy midway through (2.5 years) and at the conclusion of the five-year planning cycle in interim and final report cards, respectively. Appendix C is the final report card for the 2018 Winooski TBP. The 5-year reporting period began coincident with the publication of the 2018 Winooski TBP and goes through June 30, 2023. Data in this appendix align with the 5-year reporting period (SFY 2019–SFY 2023) available through the Clean Water Reporting Framework (CWRF). The following sections describe progress towards completing strategies in the 2018 Winooski TBP Implementation Table. Each strategy is organized by one of five major sectors – agriculture, developed lands, natural resources, forestry, and wastewater. Progress described for each strategy includes status (defined in Table C-1) as well as an explanation of actions taken. The explanation describes how the Agency and partners supported the strategy and resulting outcomes that together show that meaningful results were achieved. The outcomes include performance measures for Agency-supported assistance that were collected as part of the Accountability Framework (see Accountability Measures). Phosphorus reductions for the Winooski basin were estimated to have met about 14 percent of the basin’s total load reduction targets set by the TMDL, based on basin-level data summarized in the clean water reporting framework. While this report card does not discuss trends in annual phosphorus reductions, estimated trends since SFY 2016 can be found by basin and by sector in the TMDL reduction estimates interactive online report. Trends, as well future five-year phosphorus targets, are also further discussed in the 2023 Winooski Tactical Basin Plan’s Lake Champlain TMDL Phase 3 content.

This report depicts a watershed community that is pursuing permit compliance and implementing voluntary practices that work towards meeting the state’s water quality and phosphorus reduction goals. This is achieved through the implementation of permit programs, installation of green stormwater practices, adoption of flood resilience measures, implementation of farm agronomic practices, and application of riparian restoration and conservation projects. As described in the final status report for the 2018 Winooski TBP Implementation Table (Table C-2), most of the actions associated with regulatory programs were completed or were in progress by the interim reporting period. A majority of those were completed through Agency of Natural Resources (ANR) or Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets (AAFM) financial support to permit holders as well as partners who distributed education, outreach, and technical assistance. Regulatory compliance outcomes include increased implementation of Required Agricultural Practices (RAPs) and agricultural best management practices (BMPs) and stormwater BMPs on roads. In addition, there was a steady increase in resources provided by the state to communities and partners supporting natural resource restoration practices and stormwater management of developed land. 99",

Completed strategies were often related to either regulatory implementation as described above, the completion of discrete tasks, or the continued or accelerating implementation of programmatic strategies Figure C-1: Basin 8 Implementation Table over the full five-year period. The narrative action status of the 52 strategies in the 2018 in Table C-2 provides additional detail in TBP Implementation Table. the explanation column. 33% of the strategies are still in progress. Those strategies in progress that were pursued and then updated as a new strategy in the 2023 Winooski TBP will be reported on during the next planning cycle. Most projects in progress have completed the first phase of action, for example, a design may have been completed for a project, but the implementation of the project will be completed in the next year. Other “In Progress” strategies are those in which slightly revised approaches to the same goal warrant continued strategy tracking in the 2023 TBP. A few lakes-related strategies were not implemented because of a lack of community capacity, but these “Continued” strategies are still a priority for follow-up if partners identify or can encourage growing interest among lake communities. Finally, one strategy was discontinued because of a lack of partner capacity and interest to pursue a specific stormwater runoff phenomenon (capturing private lands stormwater before it reaches public roads). In the 2023 TBP, a new set of strategies are identified that represent the next phase of work associated with regulatory programs, or improved approaches that partners can take with agency resources to encourage implementation in the community. Additional accounting methodology will capture information on more restoration and protection activities on the landscape and show a more accurate representation of total phosphorus reductions achieved. In addition, the Clean Water Service Delivery Act (Act 76) will increasingly support the delivery of clean water services and increase regional capacity to develop and implement projects that fulfill actions.83 The Central Vermont Regional Planning Commission (CVRPC) is the Winooski basin Clean Water Service Provider. In SFY 2023 DEC awarded CVRPC a grant for $1,040,947 to achieve an annual phosphorus reduction target of 69.6 kilograms by supporting the development, implementation, and maintenance of non-regulatory clean water projects. In SFY 2024, CVRPC received $1,097,230 to achieve an additional 69.6 kilograms.
