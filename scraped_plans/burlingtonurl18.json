viCity of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Hazard mitigation is defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as “any sustainable action that reduces or eliminates long-term risk to people and property from future disasters.”1 Mitigation plans are focused on creating a collaborative, locally- specific study that identifies risks and vulnerabilities associated with natural hazards in order to diminish their likely financial and personal impacts on the community. Under the requirements of the Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, hazard mitigation plans must be updated and re-submitted to FEMA every five years for a locality or state to maintain funding eligibility. PLANNING PROCESS The Local Planning Committee (LPC), comprised of members of city staff, lead the Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update (the “2021 HMP Update” or “Plan”) planning effort. The LPC was supported by a group of local stakeholders, including members of the business community, neighboring municipal staff members, nonprofit organizations, relevant state agencies, and other participants who guided this work. In total, more than a half dozen meetings were held with city officials and stakeholders as the 2015 Plan was reviewed in full and the updated Plan began to take form. To broaden the spectrum of community input in this hazard mitigation planning process, a robust community survey was prepared in three languages – English, Portuguese, and Spanish. The survey was launched in late 2020 and was open for different periods coordinated with other public engagements through the end of the planning process in July 2021. The City of Everett communications team periodically advertised the community survey in three distinct timeframes - December 2020/January 2021, near Earth Day in April 2021, and in July 2021. Input from the community was gathered continuously to inform this update and is featured in the Plan. The Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update is also strongly guided by public outreach and education within the Everett community. Two workshops were conducted, one in December 2020 and another in July 2021. These workshops brought a mix of the LPC, a wide range of stakeholders, and the full Everett Community Growers urban agriculture nonprofit staff, including their high school student interns, into this hazard mitigation planning. 1 https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation Executive Summary 1City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Additionally, an advertised public meeting was held on July 15, 2021 with the Everett Conservation Commission. During this meeting, the Commission and the public received an update on the hazard mitigation planning process, reviewed the risk assessment, and discussed current and future mitigation projects. The draft Plan was posted on the City’s website for a period of ten days from July 22, 2021 through July 31, 2021. RISK ASSESSMENT The Plan provides risk assessment for the following natural hazards in Everett: flooding, landslides, drought, severe thunderstorms, severe winter storms, dam failures, and earthquakes. The Plan also considered projected coastal flood and coastal hazard risks associated with sea level rise impacts and increasing heat hazards due to climate change. This evaluation focused on the 2030 and 2070 time horizons for coastal flooding and the 2050 time horizon for extreme heat impacts. Approximately 18.9% of the City’s land area, and approximately 62 buildings worth an estimated $429,952,200 were identified by the LPC as areas were where flooding most frequently occurs based upon the anticipated 2020 mapped FEMA 100-year floodplain. Based upon FEMA guidance, the estimated losses in this area would range from 10% ($42,995,220) and 50% ($214,976,100) of total building value. Approximately 62.6% of the City’s land area, and approximately 1,067 buildings worth an estimated $972,165,000 were identified by the LPC as areas where flooding is projected to frequently occur in 2070 time-horizon based the Massachusetts Coastal – Flood Risk Model. Based upon FEMA guidance, the estimated losses in this area would range from 10% ($97,165,000) and 50% ($486,082,500) of total building value. MITIGATION GOALS The Plan is guided by nine Mitigation Goals, which build upon the nine goals endorsed in the 2015 HMP Update. These goals broadly represent the community’s priorities and vision for mitigating the risk of natural hazards in Everett as follows: 1. Prevent and reduce the loss of life, injury and property damages resulting from all major natural hazards. 2. Identify and seek funding for measures to mitigate or eliminate each known significant flood hazard area. 3. Integrate hazard mitigation planning as an integral factor in all relevant municipal departments, committees, and boards. • Review zoning regulations to ensure that the ordinance incorporates all reasonable hazard mitigation provisions. • Ensure that all relevant municipal departments have the resources to continue to enforce codes and regulations related to hazard mitigation. Executive Summary 2City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4. Prevent and reduce the damage to public infrastructure resulting from all hazards, incorporating a particular focus on flooding and extreme heat hazards, which are likely to intensify due to climate change. 5. Encourage the business community, major institutions, and non-profits to work with the City to develop, review and implement the hazard mitigation plan. 6. Work with surrounding communities, state, regional and federal agencies to ensure regional cooperation and solutions for hazards affecting multiple communities. • Continue to partner with the City of Chelsea to focus on the significant coastal flood hazards occurring now and in the future at the Island End River. 7. Ensure that future development meets federal, state, and local standards for preventing and reducing the impacts of natural hazards. 8. Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures that can be undertaken by property-owners. • Provide information on hazard mitigation activities in the languages most frequently spoken in Everett. 9. Take maximum advantage of resources from FEMA, MEMA, and other federal and state agencies to fund large-scale hazard mitigation projects KEY HAZARD MITIGATION ACTIONS The following mitigation actions were highlighted through this Plan: - Constructing a coastal flood barrier near the Island End River to protect regional food distribution hub and surrounding industrial area from storm surge. - Complete repair of the Market and Beacham Street culverts near the Island End River and identify needed tide gate and pump station infrastructure in this corridor. - Upgrade stormwater pipe infrastructure in the Second Street corridor to alleviate flooding and treat stormwater runoff. - Model stormwater flood risk throughout the City to identify additional mitigation projects needed. - Implement new floodplain overlay district zoning to incorporate sustainable planning into new developments and significant renovations into Chapter 9 of the Everett General Ordinances – Flood Damage Prevention. - Implement a green standard for the City that incorporates updated engineering design guides and eventually a zoning ordinance that incentivizes the use of low impact development strategies and nature-based solutions in new developments and significant renovations. Executive Summary 3City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update - Enhance community cooling centers to attract community residents to these facilities during heat waves. - Increase and protect urban tree canopy in Everett through increased tree planting and public education about benefits of healthy shade trees. Executive Summary 4City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update PLAN REVIEW AND UPDATE PROCESS Table 1-1: Plan Review and Update Chapter Reviews and Updates III – Public Public participation was a key feature of the Plan. In addition to the LPC, a Participation Stakeholder Working Group comprised of local business leaders, nonprofit organizations, neighboring municipal staffs, state agency representatives, and others led this Plan. The City of Everett focused on reaching out to the community in their primary written and/or spoken language to gather feedback. A community survey was conducted in English, Portuguese, and Spanish and was open for different periods coordinated with other public engagements through the end of the planning process. It was promoted on the City’s social media accounts, shared through LPC and stakeholder listservs and other connections, and available on the City website. An advertised public meeting was held in coordination with the Everett Conservation Commission in July 2021. The Plan was also available on the City’s website. IV – Risk The Consultant Team gathered recent available hazard and land use data and Assessment met with the LPC to identify any recent changes in land use and development trends. The critical infrastructure list was updated to incorporate new features and eliminate any facilities that were no longer operational in Everett. The best available projected coastal flood mapping from the State of Massachusetts’s endorsed MC-FRM was analyzed as part of this plan review and update. The latest version of HAZUS was also used to evaluate flooding and earthquake hazards. V - Goals The Hazard Mitigation Goals were reviewed and updated by the LPC. VI – Existing The list of existing mitigation measures was updated to reflect current Mitigation mitigation activities in the City. Measures VII & VIII – Mitigation measures from the 2015 Plan were reviewed to identify the status Hazard (complete, ongoing, or deferred) of each measure. The LPC identified Mitigation additional mitigation measures to support these efforts and new mitigation Strategy measures to address growing hazards due to the impacts of climate change. Mitigation measures were reprioritized based upon LPC, stakeholder, and community input. IX – Plan This section of the Plan was updated with a new implementation plan and five Adoption & year update process that will aid the City in continuing their progress tackling Maintenance hazard mitigation measures throughout the City. Some mitigation measures, such as the construction of a large-scale coastal flood resilience barrier at the Island End River, will require significant monetary investment. The City of Everett and its regional partners are exploring funding opportunities through the FEMA Building Resilient Executive Summary 5City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Infrastructure & Communities (BRIC) grant program, as well as other state and federal funding opportunities. Executive Summary 6Chapter 1 I NTRODUCTIONCity of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1.1 PLANNING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FEDERAL DISASTER MITIGATION ACT Each year, natural disasters in the United States cause loss of life and damage to infrastructure and property at the local, state, and federal levels. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), established in 1979, has a primary purpose to not only respond to these disasters when they strike, but to prepare for and protect against the impacts of natural hazards such as floods, storms, and extreme temperatures before they turn into disasters. To aid this effort, FEMA provides technical and financial natural disaster assistance to state and local governments through the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988 (Stafford Act). The law as originally adopted authorized the President of the United States to declare an emergency at the local and state levels following a natural disaster, thereby allowing Congressional funds and federal assistance to be provided. Recognizing that proactively planning for natural disasters would allow local, tribal, and state communities to reduce their vulnerability to loss of life and property, Congress further amended the Stafford Act with the Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 on October 30, 2000. The law requires that after November 1, 2004, municipalities who wish to be eligible for certain types of FEMA funding must adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan. Hazard mitigation is defined by FEMA as “any sustainable action that reduces or eliminates long-term risk to people and property from future disasters.”1 Mitigation plans are focused on creating a collaborative, locally-specific study that identifies risks and vulnerabilities associated with natural hazards in order to diminish their likely financial and personal impacts. Hazard mitigation plans must be updated and re-submitted to FEMA every five years for a locality or state to maintain funding eligibility. The City of Everett has formally participated in local hazard mitigation planning since 2004, when it and eight other Metro Boston communities developed the Metro Boston Multi- Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan under the guidance of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC). This regional plan allowed the neighboring communities to jointly identify inter-community hazard mitigation issues during the early years of the Federal Disaster Mitigation Act. On September 23, 2015, the City of Everett individually filed a Hazard Mitigation Plan Update (the “2015 HMP Update”) with FEMA in compliance with the requirements of the 1 https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation Chapter 1: Introduction 1-1City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Federal Disaster Mitigation Act. Based on the State of Massachusetts’ prior regional approach, the 2015 HMP Update built upon the multijurisdictional MAPC plan and was the first document prepared solely for the City of Everett. This document serves as an update to the 2015 HMP Update as required by FEMA. 1.2 PURPOSE OF THE PLAN The purpose of the Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update (the “2021 HMP Update” or “Plan”) is to provide the City of Everett with an assessment of the natural hazards it has experienced in the 2015-2021 period, as well as strategies to reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property damage resulting from likely future hazards, including those hazards exasperated by the impacts of climate change. With a robust community engagement process and a comprehensive inventory of Everett’s existing mitigation tools, the 2021 HMP Update suggests improvements to the City’s planning, policy, and programs to reduce vulnerability and risk. The City of Everett has experienced 22 hazards that triggered federal or state disaster declarations since 1991. These are listed in Table 1-1, Previous Federal/State Disaster Declarations and are reflective of the most significant hazard within the community consistently being flood hazards.

Take maximum advantage of resources from FEMA, MEMA, and other federal and state agencies to fund large-scale hazard mitigation projects 1.5 PLAN REVIEW AND UPDATE Table 1-3: Plan Review and Update Chapter Reviews and Updates III – Public Public participation was a key feature of the Plan. In addition to the Participation LPC, a Stakeholder Working Group comprised of local business leaders, nonprofit organizations, neighboring municipal staffs, state agency representatives, and others led this Plan. The City of Everett focused on reaching out to the community in their primary written and/or spoken language to gather feedback. A community survey was conducted in English, Portuguese, and Spanish and was open for different periods coordinated with other public engagements through the end of the planning process. It was promoted on the City’s social media accounts, shared through LPC and stakeholder list servs and other connections, and available on the City website. An advertised public meeting was held in coordination with the Everett Conservation Commission in July 2021. The Plan was also available on the City’s website. IV – Risk The Consultant Team gathered recent available hazard and land use Assessment data and met with the LPC to identify any recent changes in land use and development trends. The critical infrastructure list was updated to incorporate new features and eliminate any facilities that were no longer operational in Everett. The best available projected coastal flood mapping from the State of Massachusetts’s endorsed Massachusetts Coast – Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM) was analyzed as part of this plan review and update. The latest version of HAZUS was also used to evaluate flooding and earthquake hazards. V - Goals The Hazard Mitigation Goals were reviewed and updated by the LPC. VI – Existing The list of existing mitigation measures was updated to reflect current Mitigation mitigation activities in the City. Measures VII & VIII – Mitigation measures from the 2015 Plan were reviewed to identify the Hazard status (complete, ongoing, or deferred) of each measure. The LPC identified additional mitigation measures to support these efforts and new mitigation measures to address growing hazards due to the Chapter 1: Introduction 1-7City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Mitigation impacts of climate change. Mitigation measures were reprioritized Strategy based upon LPC, stakeholder, and community input. IX – Plan This section of the Plan was updated with a new implementation plan Adoption & and five year update process that will aid the City in continuing their Maintenance progress tackling hazard mitigation measures throughout the City. 1.6 AUTHORITY AND ASSURANCES The City of Everett will continue to comply with all applicable Federal laws and regulations during the periods for which it receives future grant funding, in compliance with 44 CFR 201.6. It will amend the Plan whenever necessary to reflect changes in city, state, or federal laws and regulations, as required in 44 CFR 201.6. The LPC acknowledges the following FEMA publications, which were used in this 2021 HMP Update: • Local Mitigation Planning Handbook (March 2013) • Local Mitigation Plan Review Guide (October 2011) • Demonstrating Good Practices Within Local Hazard Mitigation Plans (January 2017, FEMA Region 1) 1.7 PLAN ADOPTION The City of Everett will submit the 2021 HMP Update to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) for state review before sending the document to FEMA for approval. The City of Everett will adopt the plan when it has received “approved-pending adoption” status from FEMA. The Certificate of Adoption is included on page 4. The Certificate of Adoption is included on page 2 of this Plan. 1.8 DOCUMENT OVERVIEW The 2021 HMP Update follows FEMA guidelines and is organized into seven chapters in addition to appendices. A summary of the document is found below. Chapter 2: Community Profile The Community Profile provides an overview of the City of Everett’s geography and demographics, as well as its community resources, infrastructure, and development patterns. Chapter 3: Planning Process The Planning Process describes the community engagement process throughout the development of the 2021 HMP Update, including both internal meetings with the LPC and Chapter 1: Introduction 1-8City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update the Stakeholder Working Group and engagement efforts with members of the public. In addition to a half-day workshop with the LPC and Stakeholder Working Group, the planning team conducted a public meeting and distributed a Community Preparedness Survey. This work was further enhanced by partnering with the Everett Community Growers, a local nonprofit focused on urban agriculture and food security, to engage their diverse staff in a workshop session that focused on GIS mapping of natural hazards and robust discuss of mitigation measures to address natural hazards. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment The Risk and Vulnerability Assessment summarizes the frequency and severity of natural hazards experienced in Everett. This information is compared against the City’s land use and critical infrastructure to evaluate current and future vulnerabilities. Chapter 5: Capability Assessment The Capability Assessment inventories the City’s available tools and resources for mitigating the impacts of hazards. The chapter inventories and examines Everett’s regulations, administrative tools and staffing, policies, regional partnerships, funding sources, and education and communications systems. Chapter 6: Mitigation Goals and Strategy The Mitigation Goals and Strategy builds upon the Risk and Vulnerability Assessment and the Capability Assessment to recommend mitigation actions in Everett. These goals were agreed to by the LPC after reviewing and revising those established in the 2015 HMP Update. Chapter 7: Plan Adoption and Maintenance The Plan Adoption and Maintenance describes the process for the 2021 HMP Update’s approval by City Council and FEMA. The chapter includes a proposed evaluation schedule to monitor hazards and ongoing mitigation efforts in preparation for the forthcoming 2026 HMP Update. Appendices The Appendices include supporting documentation from the planning process, such as meeting notes, the Community Preparedness Survey and its results, data sources, and other supporting materials for the 2021 HMP Update. Chapter 1: Introduction 1-9Chapter 2 COMMUNITY PROFILECity of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 2: COMMUNITY PROFILE 2.1 INTRODUCTION Everett was settled in 1630, established as a town in 1870, and incorporated as a city in 1892. Located in Middlesex County, it is bordered by the city of Malden to the north, the cities of Chelsea and Revere to the east, the Malden River to the west, and the Mystic River to the south. The Charlestown neighborhood of the City of Boston and the Assembly Square neighborhood of the City of Somerville are located across the Mystic River. Everett is bisected by a major roadway, Route 16/Revere Beach Parkway, which runs east/west from Medford through Everett and into Chelsea. The city is close to Interstate Highways 93 and 95, has 60 miles of public roads, and is served by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Boston’s Logan International Airport is approximately 15 minutes away by car. Map 2-1 shows Everett and its road network within the regional context. It is a small city of 3.5 square miles, yet the City of Everett able to provide a high level of educational, public safety, public works and recreational services to its residents at a modest tax rate. The City's public facilities include seven elementary schools, one junior high school, and one senior high school, which offers a vocational education program. Water and sewer services are provided by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). A blue-collar working-class community, Everett has served as a gateway city to immigrants for most of its history. The community has a diversified industrial and commercial base. Everett industry contributes significantly to the economic well-being of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with many of its companies producing and servicing products in use world-wide. Everett’s employment is concentrated in industries associated with its Designated Port Area (DPA) along the Mystic River; in food produce distribution, reflecting the presence of the New England Produce Center and surrounding facilities at Beacham and Market Streets, and in a range of service and retail establishments, especially those serving health care and social services. Many of these jobs are located in industrial and commercial spaces within the city’s waterfront along the Mystic River. Table 2-1 provides a snapshot of the demographics within Everett. Chapter 2: Community Profile 2-1City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Table 2-1: Estimated Everett Characteristics Population = 46,118 • 22% are under the age of 18 • 11% are over the age of 65 • 30% speak English less than “very well” • 18% of households have no vehicle Number of Housing Units = 16,021 • 61% are renter-occupied housing units • 63% of housing units were built before 1940 Source: U.S. Census, 2019 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates 2.2 GEOGRAPHY The City of Everett is bound by two major rivers – the Mystic River along the City’s southern perimeter and the Malden River along the City’s western perimeter. The Island End River (IER) is a tributary to the Mystic River and is located south of the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) Amelia Earhart Dam. The dam provides an important tidal management resource on the Mystic River to control upstream flooding in the Mystic River watershed. The community recognizes these rivers as an important source of strength and vulnerability within the community because of the resources they provide and the challenges they present for the City of Everett. Map 2-2 provides an aerial view of the city. These rivers are an important regional asset for food security and job creation centered around a thriving produce distribution industry at the New England Produce Center. These rivers also serve as a gateway to connect the City of Everett to recent economic development across the Mystic River in Somerville and to public open space along the Mystic and Malden Rivers in Medford and Malden. The IER has been significantly altered historically by industrial development and associated fill activities for sites like the New England Produce Center where the river was culverted in 1968. Due to lack of maintenance and the impacts of significant uncontrolled stormwater and tidal flows, the Market Street Culvert at the New England Produce Center is failing with several collapsed pipe sections and exposed sinkhole areas that pose a risk to public safety, the local produce industry, and water quality in the Mystic River. The Cities of Chelsea, Everett, along with other partners are working aggressively to secure funding through FEMA and other federal, state, and non-government agencies to address this aging utility infrastructure. These coastal and riverine resources also present a growing flood risk to the City of Everett. The IER and a portion of the Mystic River south of the DCR Amelia Earhart Dam are tidally influenced and experience storm surge effects from Boston Harbor in major storm events. Relatively flat topographic elevations in Everett and neighboring Chelsea Chapter 2: Community Profile 2-2City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update also present overland pathways for coastal/saltwater flooding to impact areas deeper into the community. 2.3 LAND USE The city is characterized by both densely developed residential neighborhoods bordered by walkable neighborhoods serving commercial retail streets, as well as an intensely used industrial area that includes a power plant and a materials processing facility. There is a large open space in the northeastern portion of the city, comprised of the Woodlawn Cemetery, Beth Israel Cemetery, and Glenwood Cemetery, and smaller parks generally throughout the residential portion of the city. However, this has been changing along the Malden River through recent efforts to increase the amount of public open space and access to the riverfront by Everett’s leadership. The residential neighborhood and commercial areas are generally located in the upland hills while the industrial area is adjacent to the Mystic River and IER. Generally, residential neighborhoods are found north of Route 16. Within the low-lying area near the Mystic River and IER in Everett are a great concentration of largely industrial users: rail yard for MBTA, scrap metal recycling, oil tank farms, and a significant amount of food produce distribution (Beacham Street, Second Street). Population density is highest north of Route 16, within the residential areas of the city, and lowest along the rivers and industrial/commercial areas. Everett is most dense toward center of city and the Broadway corridor. See Map 2-3, Everett Population Density. 2.4 DEMOGRAPHICS The estimated population in Everett was 46,118 residents in 2019. The associated city- wide population density of 13,000 people per square mile assumes an even distribution of the population throughout the city. If the population was assumed to be limited to the residential areas predominantly found north of Route 16, the associated population density would be approximately 23,000 people per square mile. The median household income in Everett is $65,528 (2019 inflation-adjusted dollars). Table 2-2, Workforce Characteristics, compares the characteristics of the city’s working- age population to that of Middlesex County. The city lags the county in educational attainment: 14% of Everett’s workers lack a high school degree compared to 3% in Middlesex County and 22% of Everett workers have a Bachelor’s degree or higher compared to 57% of workers in Middlesex County. However, more of the city’s workers have some high school or a high school degree and more workers with some college or an Associate’s degree than is found in greater Middlesex County. Chapter 2: Community Profile 2-3City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Table 2-2: Workforce Characteristics Education City of Everett Middlesex County Population Age 25+ 31,559 1,137,894 Less than 9th grade 13% 3% Some High School or High 36% 22% School Graduate (or GED) Some college or Associate 29% 18% Degree Bachelor’s Degree or 22% 57% higher All census block groups are considered Environmental Justice (“EJ”) populations within Everett. The state of Massachusetts defines a neighborhood as an EJ population if any of the following conditions are true:1 • Annual median household income is not more than 65% of the statewide annual median households income; • Minorities comprise 40% or more of the population; • 25% or more of households lack English proficiency; or • Minorities comprise 25% or more of the population and the annual median household income of the municipality in which the neighborhood is located does not exceed 150% of the statewide annual median household income. Any or all of these neighborhood characteristics indicate that residents may be at a heightened risk for experiencing environmental hazards, and as such, merit particular attention during environmental resilience planning processes. EJ block groups within Everett include Minority; Minority and Income; Minority and English Isolation; and Minority, Income and English Isolation EJ communities. See Figure 2-1, Census 2020 Environmental Justice Populations, below. 1 Environmental Justice Populations in Massachusetts, https://www.mass.gov/info-details/environmental- justice-populations-in-massachusetts Chapter 2: Community Profile 2-4City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Figure 2-1: Census 2020 Environmental Justice Populations Source: MassGIS Oliver, accessed in July 2021 2.5 SERVICES AND FACILITIES Municipalities in Massachusetts are responsible for the administration and delivery of almost all city services. The public services and facilities of Everett serve as a foundation for the quality of life for residents and function of the community as a whole. Their adequacy affects the ability of the City to serve the community. As noted above, the City's educational facilities include seven elementary schools, one junior high school, and one senior high school, which offers a vocational education program. The Police Department is centrally located on Elm Street. The Fire Department has three stations: Central Station on Broadway, Hancock Street Station, and Ferry Street Station. Drinking water enters the city from the MWRA’s water distribution in five locations throughout the city. The city’s water distribution system consists of approximately 70 miles of pipe, 724 fire hydrants, and over 8,200 service connections. The city’s wastewater collection system consists of approximately 70 miles of pipe. The city’s wastewater travels via gravity through city pipes and then enters the MWRA’s wastewater collection system where it is transmitted to MWRA’s Deer Island Treatment Plant. Chapter 2: Community Profile 2-5City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Chapter 5: Capability Assessment contains additional discussion of the City’s infrastructure and its vulnerability to hazards is found in Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment. 2.6 HOUSING The City of Everett, like many cities, developed around the Broadway. Over time, the city spread out with residential homes found generally within the upland hills portion of the city, north of Route 16. Everett has 17,066 total housing units, the majority of which are multi- unit homes, as shown in Table 2-3, Type of Everett Housing Units (2019 Estimate). Approximately 39% of housing units in Everett are owner-occupied and 61% of units are renter-occupied. Table 2-3: Type of Everett Housing Units (2019 Estimate) Type of Housing Unit Percentage of Total Housing Single-family detached and 26.4% attached Multi-family (up to 4 units) 55.5% Multi-family (more than 4 units) 17.6% Mobile home 0.5% TOTAL 100% Source: U.S. Census, 2019 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates Housing stock in Everett tends to be older with 63% homes built before 1940. Only 13% of homes were constructed since 1980. See Chapter 5: Capability Assessment for a listing of Everett’s housing planning studies and their applicability to this Plan.

Outreach and incorporating feedback received creates an engaged community with inherent interest in the long-term quality of their neighborhoods and the quality of municipal infrastructure and services. To create a planning process where public and stakeholder participation is equitable and effective – especially given concerns surrounding COVID-19 – participation was sought through a variety of methods, such as working through partner organizations and using non-traditional outreach methods. To adhere to social distancing and public health guidelines, virtual meetings were used; however, effort was made to engage all community voices, including those that are not frequently represented, such as youth and elderly residents. 3.2 PLANNING TEAM The City of Everett established a Local Planning Committee (LPC) to lead this hazard mitigation planning effort. Members of the LPC, listed in Table 3-1, Local Planning Committee Members, collaborated regularly and was responsible for providing relevant information and data, reviewing the hazard assessment, evaluating goals and objectives for hazard mitigation, participating during stakeholder working group and public workshops and meetings, reviewing and providing comments on the draft Plan, and maintaining the Plan following adoption.

Public Works & Engineering * Tony Sousa Planning & Development * Indicates an individual that is no longer serving in this role in the City of Everett. The LPC met via video conference on August 27, 2020 for a kickoff meeting that set expectations for the upcoming update of the Plan, as well as reviewed the core tenets of the 2015 HMP Update Plan. Members of the LPC were familiar with each other as many serve on a similar committee, the Massachusetts Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Core Team, which is focused on similar goals with a more specific lens on climate hazards. See Chapter 7: Plan Adoption and Maintenance for further information on how this established Core Team will support the implementation of mitigation measures and keeping the Plan current going forward. The LPC also met via video conference on November 17, 2020 to prepare an upcoming hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA) workshop in December 2020. Additional information on the HIRA workshop can be found in Section 3.4, Workshops and Public Meetings, below. Prior to the November LPC meeting, members of the LPC also listened in to a video conference meeting with the Stakeholder Working Group on September 9, 2020. Additional information on the Stakeholder Working Group can be found in Section 3.3.1, Stakeholder Working Group, below. On July 13, 2021, the LPC met along with the Stakeholder Working Group in a 90-min session focused on mitigation measures. Members of the LPC, particularly Everett Conservation Agent Tom Philbin who served as the project manager for the project, also met with the consultant team developing the Plan and other stakeholders throughout the project. Going forward the LPC will continue to serve in this role as defined in Chapter 7: Plan Adoption and Maintenance, to support hazard mitigation planning and the implementation of mitigation measures going forward. 3.3 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 3.3.1 STAKEHOLDER WORKING GROUP Stakeholders from throughout the community can provide important perspectives in addition to those of City staff and the public. Participants of the HMP Stakeholder Working Group include LPC members, as well as representatives from the Chapter 3: Planning Process 3-2City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update business community, school system, social system, and utilities. The composition this working group is found in Table 3-2, Stakeholder Working Group Members. Stakeholder Working Group members are responsible for providing relevant information and data, reviewing the hazard assessment, evaluating goals and objectives for hazard mitigation, participating during stakeholder working group and public workshops and meetings, and reviewing and providing comments on the draft Plan.

Note – Stakeholders representing Exelon Corp, the New England Produce Center, Exxon Mobil, the Davis Companies, and others were also part of the e-mail distribution of Plan materials and meeting presentation materials following along with this project. The Stakeholder Working Group also helped to develop a comprehensive strategy to engage major stakeholders and the public in this process through identification of potential community outreach events and community groups and/or stakeholders to engage. Participants will be asked for assistance in distributing draft Plan materials (e.g., survey, public meeting announcements, draft Plan) to their relevant contact networks. Chapter 3: Planning Process 3-3City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update The Stakeholder Working Group met via video conference on September 9, 2020 for a kickoff meeting that set expectations for the upcoming update of the Plan, as well as introduced the members of the LPC and reviewed the core tenets of the 2015 HMP Update Plan. Members of the Stakeholder Working Group participated in the HIRA workshop in December 2020. Additional information on the HIRA workshop can be found in Section 3.4; Public Outreach, below. On July 13, 2021, the Stakeholder Working Group along with the LPC attended a 90-min session focused on mitigation measures. Feedback from stakeholders crafted the mitigation measures proposed in Chapter 6: Mitigation Goals and Strategies. Going forward, members of the Stakeholder Working Group will be invited to continue to serve in an advisory role as defined in Chapter 7: Plan Adoption and Maintenance, to support hazard mitigation planning and the implementation of mitigation measures going forward. 3.3.2 REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS Additional stakeholders from throughout the region were invited to participate in the Stakeholder Working Group Meetings and to provide their valuable assessments throughout the project. The individuals listed in Table 3-3, Regional Stakeholders, participated in the development of the Plan either through sharing of information or direct participation in project meetings.

Questions solicited information on topics such as hazard preparedness, experience with and concern about hazards, and prioritization of potential mitigation projects. The survey was posted on the City website, promoted on the City’s social media accounts, and distributed by the LPC, Stakeholder Working Group, and other parties to their networks.: The City of Everett focused on reaching out to the community in their primary written and/or spoken language to gather feedback. A community survey was conducted in English, Portuguese, and Spanish and was open for different periods coordinated with other public engagements through the end of the planning process. The survey included opportunities for the public to both answer specific questions and provide broad feedback. A copy of the community survey along with response metrics is included in Appendix B. General trends from the survey responses included a broad spectrum in the level of concern related to flooding and coastal hazards as shown in Figure 3-1: Community Survey Response Data – Concern about Natural Hazard Impacts. These results may indicate a disconnect associated with the fact that majority of residential areas are located outside of the current and projected flood hazard zones. The City of Everett intends to continue to expand public education related to flooding and coastal hazards in Everett to highlight linkages between transportation impacts, economic impacts, and other factors that can also impact residents related to flooding hazards in Everett’s Industrial District. Chapter 3: Planning Process 3-5City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Figure 3-1: Community Survey Response Data – Concern about Natural Hazard Impacts Overall, survey respondents indicated a strong focus on winter storm events, thunderstorms, and significant wind events. Additional survey feedback focused on mitigation measures to address stormwater flooding at key areas of the city such as Air Force Road, enhanced communications from the City of Everett related to hazards and preparedness and continuing to invest in utility infrastructure resilience. The City of Everett intends to keep the survey open through the public comment period and subsequent agency review of the draft Plan to continue to collect feedback from the community. 3.4.2 PROJECT WORKSHOPS Two workshops were conducted to support the development of the Plan. The first workshop took place on December 10, 2021 and was a two-and-a-half-hour session conducted via Microsoft Teams video conference platform. Attendees at the first workshop included the LPC plus a half dozen other city staff members and the Stakeholder Working Group. Participants attended three district presentations by the consultant team focused on an introduction to hazard mitigation planning, HIRA, and mitigation measures. Between each presentation segment, participants entered smaller breakout groups of approximately 6-8 individuals to discuss the topic and to use ArcGIS online mapping tool to directly assess risks and hazards in Everett. Feedback from participants indicated that use of the ArcGIS online mapping tool developed by the consultant team aided their evaluation of risks and hazards and was an engaging way to solicit meaningful feedback for the Plan. Chapter 3: Planning Process 3-6City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update The second workshop was conducted on July 8, 2021 and was a 90-minute session conducted via Microsoft Teams video conference platform. Attendees at the second workshop were staff members for a local nonprofit organization, Everett Community Growers (ECG). ECG focuses on urban agriculture and food security in Everett and operates community gardens and a farm stand for the benefit of the community. ECG staff members range from high school age to adult senior staff members and are involved in various roles to support the organization from farm field work to farm stand operations to organizational management. Participants attended three district short presentations by the consultant team focused on an introduction to hazard mitigation planning, HIRA, and mitigation measures. Between each presentation segment, participants entered smaller breakout groups of approximately 4-6 individuals to discuss the topic and to use ArcGIS online mapping tool to directly assess risks and hazards in Everett. Based upon the interests of the participants, the discussion focused on the impact of climate change on urban agriculture and the mitigation benefits of urban agriculture in addressing flooding and heat hazards. 3.4.3 PUBLIC MEETING On July 13, 2021, the Everett Conservation Commission hosted a public meeting to support this project. This meeting was used to engage the community, communicate progress regarding the project timeline and draft Plan, facilitate discussion, solicit information, and receive input and feedback throughout the drafting of the Plan. The meeting was hosted virtually and was available to the entire community. The meeting was properly noticed, posted on the City website, and promoted on the City’s social media accounts. Chapter 3: Planning Process 3-7Chapter 4 RISK AND VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTCity of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 4: RISK ASSESSMENT 4.1 UPDATE PROCESS The risk assessment analyzes the potential natural hazards that could occur within the City of Everett as well as the relationship between those hazards and current land uses, potential future development, and critical infrastructure. This section also includes a vulnerability assessment that estimates the potential damages that could result from certain large-scale natural hazard events. Everett’s risk assessment was updated using the most recently available hazard and land use data and through meetings with City staff, the Local Planning Committee (LPC), and the Stakeholder Working Group to identify changes in local hazard areas and development trends. 4.2 OVERVIEW OF HAZARDS AND IMPACTS The natural hazards within this evaluation were based on those identified in the 2015 Everett HMP, the 2018 Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP)1, and 2019 Everett Community Resilience Building Summary of Findings (resulting from a Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) program planning grant). The SHMCAP integrated the Commonwealth’s traditional hazard mitigation plan, the 2013 Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation Plan, with a climate change adaptation plan, 2011 Massachusetts Climate Change Adaptation Report. The resulting plan included an assessment of the Commonwealth’s natural hazard and climate change vulnerabilities and accounted for projected changes in precipitation, temperature, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. The MVP program2 provides support for cities and towns in Massachusetts to begin the process of planning for climate change resiliency and implementing priority projects. The state awards communities with funding to complete vulnerability assessments and develop action-oriented resiliency plans. Communities who complete the MVP program become certified as an MVP community and are eligible for MVP Action Grant funding and other opportunities. The City of Everett participated in the planning phase of this program starting in 2018 and produced the Everett Community Resilience Building Summary of 1 Massachusetts Integrated State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP) - https://www.mass.gov/service-details/massachusetts-integrated-state-hazard-mitigation-and-climate- adaptation-plan 2 Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness program - https://www.mass.gov/municipal-vulnerability- preparedness-mvp-program Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-1City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Findings report3 in 2019. In addition to this work, Everett also completed a supplemental project related to urban heat island effect and produced the Everett Urban Heat Island Supplement report4 in 2019. Table 4-1, Natural Hazard Risks Rationale, summarizes the rationale used to determine inclusion or exclusion of previously identified hazard risks within the current evaluation. Table 4-1: Natural Hazard Risks Rationale Natural Included or Rationale for Inclusion/Exclusion from Hazard Excluded from HMP Update HMP Update Flooding Included Flooding, including riverine flooding, urban stormwater flooding, and coastal flooding, remains a significant concern for Everett. MVP Community Resilience Building Workshop participants identified inland and coastal flooding as priority hazards. Coastal Included Coastal hazards, including wave damage, Hazards storm surge, and erosion along the Island End River and the tidal portion of the Mystic River, remain a significant concern that is increasing due to climate change. Severe Included Severe thunderstorms are of increasing Thunderstorms concern due to climate change. Severe Winter Included Winter storms, including the 2015 HMP Storms hazard “Nor’easters” and “Winter Storms”, remain a significant concern that is increasing due to climate change. MVP Community Resilience Building Workshop participants identified “Extreme Storms”, including severe winter storms, as a priority hazard.

Brush Fire Excluded Brush fire is not a likely occurrence in Everett due to its highly developed areas. This assessment groups the identified natural hazards according to four primary climate change interactions, consistent with the categories used within the SHMCAP: • Changes in Precipitation: Changes in the amount, frequency, and timing of precipitation—including both rainfall and snowfall—are occurring across the globe as temperatures rise and other climate patterns shift in response. • Sea Level Rise: Climate change will drive rising sea levels, and rising seas will have wide-ranging impacts on communities, natural resources, and infrastructure along the Commonwealth’s 1,519 tidal shoreline miles. • Rising Temperatures: Average global temperatures have risen steadily in the last 50 years, and scientists warn that the trend will continue unless greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced. The 9 warmest years on record all occurred in the last 20 years (2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2010, 2009, 2005, and 1998), according to the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)5. • Extreme Weather: Climate change is expected to increase extreme weather events across the globe, as well as right here in Massachusetts. There is strong evidence that storms—from heavy downpours and blizzards to tropical cyclones and hurricanes—are becoming more intense and damaging and can lead to devastating impacts for residents across the state. 5 U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - https://www.noaa.gov/news/2020-was-earth-s-2nd-hottest-year-just-behind-2016 Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-3City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Table 4-2, Climate Change Interactions and Associated Natural Hazards, provides a summary of the climate change interaction categories and the group of applicable natural hazards within this evaluation. The flooding hazard has been divided based on the predominant climate change interaction: riverine and urban flooding have been associated with “Changes in Precipitation,” and coastal flooding has been associated with “Sea Level Rise.” Consistent with the SHMCAP, dam failure and earthquake are not associated with a climate change interaction. Rather, dam failure is considered a technological and human-caused hazard and earthquake is considered a non-climate-influenced hazard. While SHMCAP does not associate dam failure with a climate change interaction, the Mystic River watershed community is focused on the impacts of climate change on the DCR Amelia Earhart Dam infrastructure and its operations. As sea levels rise over the next fifty years, the Dam may experience flanking or overtopping during coastal storm events as shown in flood projections from the Massachusetts Coast – Flood Risk Model6. Flanking is related to storm surge bypassing the dam on the land sides in Somerville and Boston and causing coastal flooding inland and on properties located on/near the non- tidal section of the Mystic River. Overtopping of the dam would occur when the elevation of storm surge extends the top elevation of the dam. An incident of overtopping would render the dam unable to control water elevations on either side of the dam allowing significant amounts of seawater into the Upper Mystic River and Malden River and likely leading to significant damage of dam equipment that would lead to a long recovery. Storm surge into the Upper Mystic River and Malden River would also lead to catastrophic regional flooding into the dozens of upstream communities that are tributary to the Mystic River. State agencies with local municipal support are currently working on interventions to improve the resilience of the dam, including the addition of more pumping infrastructure, protection of existing dam equipment, and land side projects to raise ground elevations in Somerville and Boston adjacent to the dam.

Exposure is often determined by examining the number of people or assets that lie within a geographic area affected by a natural hazard, or by determining the magnitude of the climate change impact. For example, measurements of flood depth outside a building or number of heat waves experienced by a county are measurements of exposure. • Natural hazard: Natural hazards are natural events that threaten lives, property, and other assets. Often, natural hazards can be predicted. They tend to occur repeatedly in the same geographical locations because they are related to weather patterns or physical characteristics of an area. • Risk: The potential for an unwanted outcome resulting from a hazard event, as determined by its likelihood and associated consequences; and expressed, when possible, in dollar losses. Risk represents potential future losses, based on assessments of probability, severity, and vulnerability. In some instances, dollar losses are based on the actual demonstrated impact. In other cases, dollar losses are demonstrated through exposure analysis due to the inability to determine the extent to which a structure is impacted. • Severity/Extent: The extent or magnitude of a hazard, as measured against an established indicator (e.g., Richter Scale, Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, or Regional Snowfall Index). • Vulnerability: The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected; for example, as applied to building performance (functionality), damage, or the number of people injured. Vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-5City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.3 HAZARDS IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION 4.3.1 RIVERINE AND URBAN FLOODING Riverine and urban flooding was the most prevalent serious natural hazard identified by City staff, the LPC, and the Stakeholder Working Group. The MVP Community Resilience Building workshop participants also indicated it was a natural hazard of particular concern. Riverine flooding occurs when the rate of precipitation and/or amount of stormwater runoff overwhelms the capacity of natural or structured drainage systems causing overflows; urban flooding occurs when precipitation causes the water table to rise and leads to flooding of low-lying areas such as streets and underpasses. The City of Everett is bound by two major rivers – the Mystic River along the City’s southern perimeter and the Malden River along the City’s eastern perimeter. The Island End River is a tributary to the Mystic River and is located south of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) Amelia Earhart Dam. Flooding is generally caused by hurricanes, nor’easters, severe rainstorms, and thunderstorms. As noted in the SHMCAP, secondary hazards for flooding include landslides following flood events when high flows oversaturate soils on steep slopes, causing them to fail. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time as storms with increased precipitation rates become more frequent. 4.3.1.1 LOCATION Many of Everett’s urban flooding problems are associated with aging infrastructure and dense development patterns that involve significant areas of impervious surfaces which limit infiltration of precipitation and accelerate the velocity of stormwater runoff. Some areas within Everett that experience significant urban flooding issues include the Second Street corridor, which lacks stormwater infrastructure, Air Force Road, the Commercial Triangle section of Everett between Route 16 and the commuter rail tracks, and the area surrounding Glendale Park, which includes the site of the Everett Police Department. In addition to these areas, critical infrastructure that is vulnerable to flooding due to their location in the FEMA flood zone are indicated in Table 4-14 and shown on Map 4-1. For sites related to coastal flooding, see Section 4.4.1.1. Related underlying infrastructural deficiencies are noted, where available, and have been updated to reflect current conditions. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-6City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.3.1.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD DCR maintains a network of approximately 60 precipitation observation stations throughout Massachusetts. The station closest to Everett, the East Boston station “BOSNWS,” recorded an average of 44.3 inches of annual precipitation between 1990-2014.7 This is significantly more than the national precipitation average of 30.9 inches during the same timeframe.8 4.3.1.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS As city-specific data for previous urban flooding occurrences is not available, county-level flooding data was used as the best available. Middlesex County, which includes Everett, has had 14 FEMA flood- related declared disasters between 1954 and 2017, as shown in the SHMCAP. Based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Storm Events Database, 83 historic flood events occurred in Middlesex County between April 1, 2014 and December 31, 2020. These events are compiled and are summarized in Table 4-3. Total damages for all floods since April 2014 totaled $1.27 million.

Problems in the drainage system and aging infrastructure continue to increase the probability of urban flooding. 4.3.2 LANDSLIDES According to the SHMCAP, “the term landslide includes a wide range of ground movement, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes, and shallow debris flows. Although gravity acting on an over steepened slope is the primary reason for a landslide, there are other contributing factors.” Among the contributing factors are erosion by rivers, glaciers, or ocean waves create over steepened slopes; rock and soil slopes weakened through saturation by snowmelt or heavy rains; earthquakes create stresses that make weak slopes fail; and excess weight from accumulation of rain or snow, and stockpiling of rock or ore, from waste piles, or from man-made structures. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time as storms with increased precipitation rates become more frequent. Landslides can result from human activities that destabilize an area or can occur as a secondary impact from another natural hazard such as flooding. In addition to structural damage to buildings and the blockage of transportation corridors, landslides can lead to sedimentation of water bodies. 4.3.2.1 LOCATION Landslides are a potential city-wide hazard in Everett. However, the City has limited vulnerability to landslides, and no critical facilities were identified with high vulnerability to landslides. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-11City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.3.2.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD The entire city is classified as having a moderate risk for landslides. See Map 4-2. 4.3.2.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS There have been no documented landslides in Everett. 4.3.2.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS The LPC did not believe that landslides pose a significant risk to Everett and did not take actions regarding this hazard in the 2008 or 2015 Plans. There have been no comments from the community regarding landslides. 4.3.3 DROUGHT As noted by the SHMCAP, “droughts can vary widely in duration, severity, and local impact. They may have widespread social and economic significance that requires the response of numerous parties, including water suppliers, firefighters, farmers, and residents. Droughts are often defined as periods of deficient precipitation. How this deficiency is experienced can depend on factors such as land use change, the existence of dams, and water supply withdrawals or diversions. For example, impervious surfaces associated with development can exacerbate the effects of drought due to decreased groundwater recharge.” Climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time as rising temperatures and precipitation patterns become more variable and extreme. 4.3.3.1 LOCATION In Everett, drought is a potential city-wide hazard. However, the impact of drought on Everett’s water supply is limited because the City receives its water supply from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), which operates two large reservoirs in central Massachusetts, Wachusett and Quabbin Reservoirs. Because of the very large ratio of storage to annual demand, the MWRA water system is very well buffered from the impacts of drought in terms of its ability to supply water to its service population. Even the multi-year drought of record from 1962 to 1965 did not seriously impair the MWRA water system. The City of Everett has not had to impose emergency water restrictions. Were there to be a severe drought worse than the drought of record, water use restrictions could be implemented, which would mainly have an impact on nonessential outdoor water use for irrigation of public parks and playing fields and residential lawns. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-12City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.3.3.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD Massachusetts generally receives enough precipitation under normal conditions to not be considered at a large risk for drought. DCR’s precipitation observation station closest to Everett, the East Boston station “BOSNWS,” recorded an average of 44.3 inches of annual precipitation between 1990-2014. This is significantly more than the national precipitation average of 30.9 inches during the same timeframe. 4.3.3.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS Everett does not collect data relative to drought events. Because drought is more of a regional natural hazard, this plan references state data as the best available data for drought. As noted in the SHMCAP, the Massachusetts has never received a Presidential Disaster Declaration for a drought-related disaster. However, Massachusetts has experienced extended periods of dry weather over the past 100 years and has recorded events dating back to 1879. 4.3.3.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS The Boston Harbor basin, which includes Everett, is expected to see a slight decrease to an increase in consecutive dry days throughout this century compared to the annual baseline of approximately 17 days per year from 1971 to 2001. Table 4-4, Projected Annual Consecutive Dry Days, indicates the projected number of consecutive dry days according to the “high” and “low” limits of the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (NE CASC) data. In addition, the SHMCAP indicated that the average time between rain events is likely to remain fairly constant; however, individual drought events could still increase in frequency and severity.

The SHMCAP states coastal flooding is defined by the submersion of land along the ocean coast and other inland waters caused by the movement of seawater over and above normal present-day tide action. These types of flooding are often combined as storm events lead to large amounts of draining stormwater, which can be blocked by elements of the built environment and can be backed up when drainage locations (ponds, streams, etc.) are at or above capacity. Sea level rise driven by climate change will exacerbate these issues over time. 4.4.1.1 LOCATION The Island End River and a portion of the Mystic River south of the DCR Amelia Earhart Dam are tidally influenced and experience storm surge effects from Boston Harbor in major storm events. Relatively flat topographic elevations in Everett and neighboring Chelsea also present overland pathways for coastal/saltwater flooding to impact areas deeper into the community. Many of the City’s currently identified areas of flooding concern are directly linked to the filling of the Island End River in the early 1900s by the Eastern Gas and Coal Company, as well as subsequent filing for the construction of the New England Produce Center. The river was replaced by a ditch and culvert, which are partially located in adjoining Chelsea, and eventually drain into the Island End River in Chelsea near Williams Street. Several of the flooding areas of concern identified below are associated with the degraded Market Street culvert. The area of Everett that experiences the most significant coastal flooding issues is the New England Produce Center and surrounding properties along the Island End River. During three coastal storm events in 2018 identified in Chapter 1: Introduction, significant flooding inundated this area filling roadways and parking areas, submerging the commuter and freight rail tracks, and limiting vehicle access and commerce associated with produce distribution. Flood projections from the MC-FRM, which incorporates sea level rise, show increasing risk of severe damage in this area, as well as other areas along the Lower Mystic River from storm surge during coastal storm events. Additionally, piped infrastructure that flows into the Market and Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-14City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Beacham Street culverts and ultimately discharges at an outfall into the Island End River can become surcharged with seawater when that outfall is submerged during coastal storm events. This condition creates multiple pathways back into Everett’s Industrial District and Commercial Triangle to spread the extent of coastal flood hazards. Locations such as Spring Street along the commuter rail tracks historically had tide gate infrastructure to limit this hazard. At this time, the majority of these upstream tide gates have fallen into disrepair due to age and lack of maintenance. In addition to these areas, the critical infrastructure vulnerable to flooding due to their location in both the FEMA flood zone are indicated in Table 4-14 and shown on Map 4-1. For sites related to urban flooding, see Section 4.3.1.1. 4.4.1.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD Sea level rise is impacting the coastal areas of Everett. Table 4-5, NE CASC Relative Mean Sea Level Projections for Boston, MA Tide Station, shows relative (or local) mean sea level projections for the nearest tide station to Everett. The projections for the Boston tide station are based on four National Climate Assessment global scenarios with associated probabilistic model outputs from the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (NE CASC). The values reflect the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) high emissions pathway (RCP 8.5).

However, Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-15City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update localized coastal flooding incidents, most recently reported during the three storm events in 2018, and coastal flooding within Everett’s Industrial District is occurring with increasing frequency from a combination of storm surge, rising sea levels influencing tidal flooding occurrences, and the interaction with urban and coastal flooding hazards. Between 1921 and 2020, a relative sea level rise trend of 2.87 mm/year with a 95 percent confidence interval of +/- 0.15 mm/year (equivalent to 0.94 feet over a 100-year period) was observed in Boston.9 4.4.1.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS The frequency and severity of routine tidal flooding and storm-related flooding will increase due to the sea level rise effect of climate change. In addition, the frequency of severe storm events and resulting storm surge sufficient to cause coastal flooding is likely to increase due to climate change. However, as noted within the SHMCAP, communities like Everett can plan infrastructure improvements in preparation for elevated water levels using best available flood projection data for time horizons from present day out to the end of the century. 4.4.2 COASTAL HAZARDS Coastal hazards, including wave damage, storm surge, and erosion, remain a significant concern that is increasing due to climate change. Eroded coastlines have a lower capacity to buffer against the storm surge associated with hurricanes, nor’easters or other coastal storms, resulting in the greater vulnerability. Rising sea levels have led to increased rates of erosion along beaches and coastlines and the undermining of coastal bulkheads and estuarine river banks in Everett. Bulkheads and coastal banks in Everett protect the buildings from storm damage and their failure can lead to increased property damage. 4.4.2.1 LOCATION The City experiences erosion and undercutting along its Mystic River banks when the Amelia Earhart dam is opened by DCR to increase storm water storage capacity by lowering the level of the Upper Mystic River. The areas potentially impacted along the Mystic River do not 9 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 2018. Tides and Currents. Extreme Water Levels. Station 844390.

The extent of damage from coastal flooding is influenced by variables such as elevated coastal landforms. Coastal banks, salt marshes, and other elevated coastal landforms can buffer increased tidal levels and storm surges. 4.4.2.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS The City does not keep records of specific coastal erosion events, but the process is an incremental one over the long term. FEMA has indicated in their latest rules that post hazard event reconstruction or repair funding for coastal protection structures will only be made available where the damage can be directly attributed to the storm event. Therefore, to receive this funding, the City must maintain records of maintenance and repair activities that demonstrate the status of each structure. 4.4.2.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS The frequency of severe storm events and resulting storm surge sufficient to cause wave damage, storm surge, and erosion is likely to increase due to climate change. 4.5 HAZARDS IMPACTED BY RISING TEMPERATURES 4.5.1 HIGH HEAT There is no universal definition for extreme temperatures. The term is relative to the usual weather in the region based on climatic averages. High heat, for this climatic region, is usually defined as a period of 3 or more consecutive days above 90 °F, but more generally a prolonged period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high humidity. 4.5.1.1 LOCATION High heat is a city-wide hazard which has had an impact on Everett’s residents, especially on the more vulnerable populations such the elderly, school-aged children, and people with certain medical conditions, such as heart disease. However, even young and healthy individuals can succumb to heat if they participate in strenuous physical Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-17City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update activities during hot weather. Some behaviors also put people at greater risk: drinking alcohol; taking part in strenuous outdoor physical activities in hot weather; and taking medications that impair the body's ability to regulate its temperature or that inhibit perspiration. The urban heat island effect is when cities experience much warmer temperatures than suburbs and rural communities on hot days. Dense development patterns, large areas of industrial land use, heavy commercial trucking activity, limited tree canopy cover, and a high percentage of impervious land cover all contribute to the urban heat island effect throughout Everett. The critical facilities vulnerable to flooding due to their location in areas mapped as historical experiencing urban heat island impacts such as localized higher ambient temperatures are indicated in Table 4-14 and shown on Map 4-3. 4.5.1.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD While a heat wave for Massachusetts is defined as three or more consecutive days above 90°F, another measure used for identifying extreme heat events is through a Heat Advisory from the NWS. These advisories are issued when the heat index (Figure 4-1) is forecast to exceed 100 degree Fahrenheit (F) for 2 or more hours; an excessive heat advisory is issued if forecast predicts the temperature to rise above105 degree F. Figure 4-1: National Weather Service (NWS) Heat Index Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-18City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.5.1.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS The City of Everett does not collect data on high heat occurrences. According to the SHMCAP, over the last two decades, an average of two high heat weather events have occurred in Massachusetts annually. There are an average of four to five heat waves annually in Massachusetts. From 1979-2003, excessive heat exposure caused 8,015 deaths in the United States. During this period, more people in this country died from extreme heat than from hurricanes, lightning, tornados, floods, and earthquakes combined. The NCEI Storm Events Database record from July 6, 2010 indicates the temperature in eastern Massachusetts ranged from 100 to 106 degrees Fahrenheit. There were no reported deaths, injuries or property damage resulting from excessive heat. 4.5.1.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS Massachusetts is expected to see an increase in the number of high heat days in the coming years. The NE CASC data support the trends of an increased frequency of extreme hot weather events.

Cumulonimbus clouds produce lightning. Frequently during thunderstorm events, gusty winds, and heavy rain sufficient to produce flooding are present. Less frequently, hail is present, which can become very large in size. Tornadoes can also be generated during these events. The National Weather Service defines a severe thunderstorm as a thunderstorm that produces one-inch hail or larger in diameter and/or winds equal or exceed 58 mph. The city is vulnerable to both the wind and precipitation associated with thunderstorms. High winds can cause damage to structures, fallen trees, and downed power lines leading to power outages. Intense rainfall can overwhelm drainage systems causing localized flooding of rivers and streams as well as urban stormwater ponding and localized flooding. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-20City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update As severe thunderstorms are wind- and precipitation-related hazards, climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time as storms with increased severity and increased precipitation rates become more frequent. 4.6.1.1 LOCATION The effect and impact from severe thunderstorms are experienced across both the city and the entire state. 4.6.1.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD Thunderstorms can lead to localized damage and represent a hazard risk for communities. Severe thunderstorm can form quickly, and, on average, they are only around 15 miles in diameter and last for about 30 minutes. They are typically more difficult to predict than continental and coastal storms. 4.6.1.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS Eastern Massachusetts is at risk of one to two severe thunderstorms per year. Everett experienced three severe thunderstorm events from 2005 to April 30, 2014 with no deaths or injuries. Based on data from the NCEI Storm Events Database, 236 thunderstorm wind events occurred on 48 days in Middlesex County between April 1, 2014 and December 31, 2020. This includes six events on three days in Everett, causing an estimated $35,500 in property damage. During the same time period, the Storm Events Database reflects two hail events in Everett. These storms are detailed in Table 4-7. Table 4-7: Everett Hail and Thunderstorm Wind Events April 1, 2014 through December 31, 2020 Type of Property Date of Event Death/Injuries Event Damage 7/7/2014 Thunderstorm $5,000 0/0 Wind 7/7/2014 Thunderstorm $5,000 0/0 Wind 7/7/2014 Thunderstorm $5,000 0/0 Wind 8/7/2014 Hail $0 0/0 Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-21City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Type of Property Date of Event Death/Injuries Event Damage 8/4/2015 Hail $0 0/0 7/23/2016 Thunderstorm $15,000 0/0 Wind 7/23/2016 Thunderstorm $5,000 0/0 Wind 8/7/2019 Thunderstorm $500 0/0 Wind TOTAL $35,500 0/0 4.6.1.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS The NE CASC data support the trend of a slightly increased frequency of extreme precipitation events, defined as days with more than two inches of precipitation. The SHMCAP notes that “based on these available projections for future rainfall events, the probability of future thunderstorm events is anticipated to increase.” 4.6.2 SEVERE WINTER STORMS Severe winter storms include ice storms, nor’easters, heavy snow, blowing snow, and other extreme forms of winter precipitation. Winter storms are the most common and most familiar of the region’s hazards that affect large geographic areas. An increased amount of severe winter storms is expected due to climate change. Most blizzards and ice storms in the region cause more inconvenience than they do serious property damage, injuries, or deaths. However, periodically, a storm will occur which is a true disaster, and necessitates intense large-scale emergency response. Occasionally winter storms can also hinder the tidal exchange in tidally restricted watersheds and result in localized flooding within these areas. Ice build- up at gate structures can also damage tide gates and increase the hazard potential because of malfunctioning tide gates. Coastal storms also cause flooding because of tidal surges. Because a major feature of winter storms is the tendency for higher tides with associated flooding, the same mitigation measures in place for flooding are all important for mitigating the impacts of winter storms. However, the rapid melting Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-22City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update of snow after major storms, combined with rainfall, is more of a common flooding threat. The Everett Department of Public Works clears roads as requested by emergency service providers and carries on general snow removal operations, in conjunction with local snow removal contractors. The City continues to ban on-street parking at nights during snow storm events and during snow removal to ensure that streets can be plowed, and public safety vehicle access is maximized. The city’s overall vulnerability to winter storms is primarily related to restrictions to travel on roadways, temporary road closures, school closures, and potential restrictions on emergency vehicle access. A secondary vulnerability is power outages due to fallen trees and utility lines. 4.6.2.1 LOCATION The entire city is at risk for winter storms. The elderly population is particularly susceptible due to their increased risk of injury and death from falls, overexertion, or hypothermia related to clearing snow or power failures. Also vulnerable are low income residents who may lack access to housing or housing with sufficient insulation or heating supply. 4.6.2.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD The average annual snowfall for most of the city is 36.1 to 48.0 inches. There is a small band in the northwestern part of the city where the average snowfall is 48.1 to 72.0 inches. 4.6.2.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS The City of Everett does not keep local records of winter storms. Data for Middlesex County, which includes Everett, is the best available data to help understand previous occurrences and impacts of winter storm events. The NCEI Storm Events Database includes 39 heavy snow events in Middlesex County between April 1, 2014 and December 31, 2020, as shown in Table 4-8. Table 4-8: Middlesex County Heavy Snow Events April 1, 2014 through December 31, 2020 Date of Heavy Snow Property Death/Injuries Event Damage 11/26/2014 $10,000 0/0 1/24/2015 $0 0/0 1/24/2015 $0 0/0 1/24/2015 $0 0/0 Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-23City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Date of Heavy Snow Property Death/Injuries Event Damage 1/26/2015 $0 0/0 1/26/2015 $0 0/0 2/2/2015 $0 0/0 2/2/2015 $0 0/0 2/2/2015 $0 0/0 2/8/2015 $0 0/0 2/8/2015 $0 0/0 2/8/2015 $0 0/0 2/14/2015 $0 0/0 2/14/2015 $0 0/0 2/14/2015 $0 0/0 2/5/2016 $0 0/0 2/5/2016 $70,000 0/0 2/5/2016 $5,000 0/0 3/21/2016 $0 0/0 4/4/2016 $0 0/0 12/29/2016 $0 0/0 3/14/2017 $0 0/0 3/14/2017 $0 0/0 3/14/2017 $0 0/0 11/15/2018 $0 0/0 11/15/2018 $0 0/0 11/15/2018 $0 0/0 12/1/2019 $0 0/0 12/1/2019 $1,500 0/0 12/1/2019 $2,500 0/0 1/18/2020 $0 0/0 1/18/2020 $0 0/0 3/23/2020 $0 0/0 10/30/2020 $500 0/0 12/5/2020 $0 0/0 12/5/2020 $0 0/0 12/16/2020 $0 0/0 12/16/2020 $0 0/0 12/16/2020 $0 0/0 TOTAL $89,500 0/0 4.6.2.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS A notable winter storm generally occurs at least once every winter, according to the SHMCAP. Nor’easters are the most frequently occurring natural hazard in the state, generally occurring on an annual basis with some years bringing up to four nor’easter events. Ice storms impact the Commonwealth on at least an annual basis. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-24City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.6.3 STRONG WINDS Strong winds, including those resulting from hurricanes and tornadoes, remain a significant concern for Everett. Effects from high winds can include downed trees and/or power lines and damage to roofs, windows, and other structural components. High winds can cause scattered power outages. High winds are also a hazard for the boating, shipping, and aviation industry sectors. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time warmer temperatures create energy for more intense storms and increased precipitation rates become more frequent. A hurricane is a violent wind and rainstorm with wind speeds of 74-200 miles per hour. A hurricane is strongest as it travels over the ocean and is particularly destructive to coastal property as the storm hits the land. Hurricanes generally occur between June and November. There have been no significant changes to address hurricane emergency response since 2005. The two major mitigation measures in place are adherence to the Massachusetts State Building Code and the City’s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan which addresses hurricane hazards although primarily from a response perspective. A tornado is a violent windstorm characterized by a narrow, violently rotating column of air that extends from the base of a thunderstorm to the ground. They develop when cool air overrides a layer of warm air, causing the warm air to rise rapidly. Most vortices remain suspended in the atmosphere. Should they touch down, they become a force of destruction. There have been no changes since the 2008 Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan to address tornadoes in Everett beyond maintaining emergency shelters in the event that they were needed. The City has adopted the Massachusetts State Building Code. The code’s provisions are the most cost-effective mitigation measure against tornados given the extremely low probability of occurrence. The City does maintain American Red Cross certified emergency shelters if they were needed in case of evacuations due to tornadoes. 4.6.3.1 LOCATION Eastern Massachusetts, including Everett, has been impacted to varying degrees by numerous hurricanes throughout its history. Given their typical characteristics and size, they have the potential to impact the entire city of Everett. Given their unpredictable track, tornadoes are a potential city-wide hazard in Everett. Most structures pre-date current building codes and could be subject to significant damages. Evacuation may be required Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-25City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update on short notice. Sheltering and mass feeding efforts may be required along with debris clearance, search and rescue, and emergency fire and medical services. 4.6.3.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD Hurricanes range from 50 to 500 miles across. Hurricane intensity is measured according to the Saffir-Simpson scale, which categorizes hurricane intensity linearly based upon maximum sustained winds, barometric pressure, and storm surge potential. These are combined to estimate potential damage. Table 4-9 gives an overview of the wind speeds and range of damage caused by different hurricane categories. Table 4-9: Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale Category Sustained Range of Damage Winds Speed (mph) 1 74-95 Very dangerous winds will produce some damage. 2 96-110 Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage. 3 111-129 Devastating damage will occur. 4 130-156 Catastrophic damage will occur. 5 157 or higher Catastrophic damage will occur. Source: NOAA National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center, https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php Tornado damage severity is measured by the Fujita Tornado Scale, in which wind speed is not measured directly but rather estimated from the amount of damage. As of February 01, 2007, the National Weather Service began rating tornados using the Enhanced Fujita-scale (EF- scale), shown in Table 4-9, which allows surveyors to create more precise assessments of tornado severity. Table 4-10: Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale EF 3-Second Gust Rating (mph) 0 65-85 1 86-110 2 111-135 3 136-165 4 166-200 5 Over 200 Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-26City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.6.3.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS Major storm events, such as hurricanes and tornados have been an occasional, albeit not frequent, threat to Everett. In 1944, a Category 1 hurricane tracked through northwestern Everett. A hurricane or storm track is the line that delineates the path of the eye of a hurricane or tropical storm. Typically, the entire city experiences the impacts of the wind and rain of hurricanes and tropical storms, regardless of the storm track. Tornadoes are rare in eastern Massachusetts. Although no tornadoes have been recorded within the City of Everett, a tornado rated as F2 struck the neighboring cities of Chelsea and Revere on July 28, 2014. 4.6.3.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS Storms with strong winds are projected to occur with increased frequency and intensity. Hurricanes and tropical storms are generally limited to the months of July, August, September, and October, with a few storms arriving in May, June, or November. As noted in the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s Fourth National Climate Assessment, tornado activity in the U.S. has become more variable, with a decrease in the number of days per year that tornadoes occur but an increase in the number of tornadoes on these days. 4.7 DAM FAILURE Considered a technological and human-caused hazard, dam failure can arise from two types of situations. Dams can fail because of structural problems independent of any storm event. Dam failure can follow an earthquake by causing structural damage. Dams can fail structurally because of flooding arising from a storm or they can overspill due to flooding. The DCR Amelia Earhart Dam separates the tidal and the non-tidal parts of the Mystic River. Constructed in 1966, is estimated to need $5 million dollars in repairs, including repairs to the third pump and the possible installation of a fourth pump. The dam is currently able to pump 4,000 cubic feet per second of flow from the Mystic and Malden Rivers against high tide into Boston Harbor. The pump improvements would increase the rate that flood water can travel out of the cities and towns along the Mystic River. 4.7.1 LOCATION The Amelia Earhart Dam is located on the Mystic River between the Cities of Everett and Somerville. It is owned and operated by the DCR, which also owns the Mystic Lakes Dam in Medford/Arlington, which is part of the Mystic Lakes system, located further upstream the Mystic River watershed. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-27City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.7.2 EXTENT OF HAZARD The dam provides an important tidal management resource on the Mystic River to control upstream flooding in the Mystic River watershed. In the event of a dam failure, the energy of the water stored behind even a small dam can cause loss of life and property damage if there are people or buildings downstream. The number of fatalities from a dam failure depends on the amount of warning provided to the population and the number of people in the area in the path of the dam’s floodwaters. In the case of the Amelia Earhart Dam, if a dam failure occurred, the lower elevation areas of Everett along the Mystic River could be impacted by flooding. In Everett, these areas do not include populated residential areas and are mostly industrial properties, some of which are abandoned or underutilized sites, but also include some currently active operations and many of which are currently storing hazardous materials such as petroleum products, fuels, and other chemicals. 4.7.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS There has never been a dam failure in Everett. 4.7.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS Dam failure in general is infrequent but has the potential for severe impacts. However, projected sea level rise and greater storm intensity increase the probability that floodwaters could flank and/or overtopping the dam in its current condition. 4.8 EARTHQUAKE An earthquake, a non-climate influenced hazard, is the vibration of the Earth’s surface that follows a release of energy in the Earth’s crust. These earthquakes often occur along fault boundaries. As a result, areas that lie along fault boundaries—such as California, Alaska, and Japan—experience earthquakes more often than areas located within the interior portions of these plates. New England, on the other hand, experiences intraplate earthquakes because it is located deep within the interior of the North American plate. 4.8.1 LOCATION Earthquakes are a potential city-wide hazard in Everett. The City has many un- reinforced, older masonry buildings which would be vulnerable in a severe earthquake. 4.8.2 EXTENT OF HAZARD Seismologists use the Richter Scale to express the amount of seismic energy released by an earthquake (shown in Table 4-11), while the intensity of an Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-28City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update earthquake is measured by the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale (shown in Figure 4-3). As the Richter Scale has a logarithmic basis, each whole number step corresponds to the release of about 31 times more energy than the preceding whole number. Table 4-11: Richter Scale Magnitude Earthquake Effects Less than 3.5 Usually not felt, but can be recorded by seismograph. 3.5-5.4 Often felt, but only causes minor damage. 5.5-6.0 Slight damage to buildings and other structures. 6.1-6.9 May cause a lot of damage in very populated areas. 7.0-7.9 Major earthquake. Serious damage. 8 or greater Great earthquake. Can totally destroy communities near the epicenter. Figure 4-3: Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale 4.8.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS There have been no recorded earthquake epicenters within the City of Everett although residents may feel the tremors from one or more of the infrequent earthquakes recorded within the region. 4.8.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS Earthquakes cannot be predicted and may occur at any time. As stated in the SHMCAP, “because of the low frequency of earthquake occurrence and the Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-29City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update relatively low levels of ground shaking that are usually experienced, the entire Commonwealth can be expected to have a low to moderate risk to earthquake damage as compared to other areas of the country.” 4.9 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT TRENDS 4.9.1 EXISTING LAND USE As previously noted, Everett has both densely developed residential neighborhoods, as well as an intensely used industrial area that includes a marine terminal associated with liquified natural gas (LNG), fuel storage facilities, and a materials processing facility. The residential neighborhood and commercial areas are in the upland hills while the industrial area is adjacent to the Mystic River and Island End River. Everett is a densely populated city with over 13,000 people per square mile and is also an Environmental Justice community. Except for the waterfront areas, there is little natural open space, with acres of cemeteries located in the northeast section of the city and smaller parks located throughout the city. The city’s land use is shown on Map 4-4. The most recent land use statistics available from the state are from aerial photography taken in 2016. Table 4-12 shows the acreage and percentage of land in 13 categories. If the residential categories are aggregated, residential uses make up 32.8% (722.6 acres) of the city’s area. The most prevalent use is multi- family residential with 21.3% (469.5 acres) of the city’s use. Table 4-12: 2016 City of Everett Land Use Land Use Acres Percentage of Total Area Commercial 298.6 13.5% Industrial 325.6 14.8% Mixed use, other 7.4 0.3% Mixed use, primarily commercial 0.1 0.0% Mixed use, primarily residential 17.1 0.8% Open land 85.7 3.9% Residential - multi-family 469.5 21.3% Residential - other 0.3 0.0% Residential - single family 252.7 11.5% Right-of-way 405.2 18.4% Tax exempt 326.8 14.8% Unknown 16.6 0.8% Water 0.1 0.0% TOTAL 2,205.6 100% 4.9.2 POTENTIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENT Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-30City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update The following areas were identified from recent planning and permitting efforts as likely to be developed in the future, defined for the purposes of this plan as a ten- year time horizon. These areas are described below and shown on Map 4-5. Everett has permitted with focus on hazards. A. 114 Spring Street: 1 acre, 360+ residential units and 7,400 square feet of retail space, permitting stage B. Second & Vine Street: 6-story building, 320 residential units, 4,000 square feet retail space, permitting stage C. 1690 Revere Beach Parkway (Stop & Shop site): 5.6 acres in Everett, 800 residential units, 15,000 square feet retail space, permitting stage D. 85 Boston Street (Wood Waste site): 650 residential units, 9,000 square feet retail space, permitting stage E. 35-45 Garvey Street: Two 8-story buildings, 591 residential units, 7,400 square feet of retail space, permitting stage F. 110 Tremont: 2 buildings, 48 residential units, permitting stage G. 6 Norman Street: 5-story building, 66 residential units, permitting stage H. 65 Norman Street: 6-story building, 398 residential units, permitting stage 4.10 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN HAZARD AREAS Critical infrastructure includes facilities that are important for disaster response and evacuation (such as emergency operations centers, fire stations, water pump stations, etc.) and facilities where additional assistance might be needed during an emergency (such as nursing homes, elderly housing, and day care centers). These facilities are listed in Table 4-13 and are shown on Map 4-6. The critical facilities and their relationship to natural hazards are summarized in Table 4-13. The purpose of mapping the natural hazards and critical infrastructure is to present an overview of hazards in the community and how they relate to critical infrastructure, to better understand which facilities may be vulnerable to particular natural hazards.

A vulnerability assessment and estimation of damages was performed for earthquakes and flooding using HAZUS software. 4.11.1 INTRODUCTION TO HAZUS-MH HAZUS- MH (multiple-hazards) is a computer program developed by FEMA to estimate losses due to a variety of natural hazards. The following overview of HAZUS-MH is taken from the FEMA website. For more information on the HAZUS-MH software, go to https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/products-tools/hazus. “Hazus is a nationally standardized risk modeling methodology. It is distributed as free GIS-based desktop software with a collection of inventory databases for every U.S. state and territory. Hazus identifies areas with high risk for natural hazards and estimates physical, economic, and social impacts of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tsunamis. The Hazus Program, managed by FEMA’s Natural Hazards Risk Assessment Program, partners with other federal agencies, research institutions, and regional planning authorities to ensure Hazus resources incorporate the latest scientific and technological approaches and meet the needs of the emergency management community. Hazus is used for mitigation, recovery, preparedness, and response. Mitigation planners, GIS specialists, and emergency managers use Hazus to determine potential losses from disasters and to identify the most effective mitigation actions for minimizing those losses. Hazus supports the risk assessment requirement in the mitigation planning process. Response planners use Hazus to map potential impacts from catastrophic events and identify effective strategies for response and preparedness. Hazus is also used during real-time response efforts to estimate impacts from incoming storms or ongoing earthquake sequences. Hazus can quantify and map risk information such as: • Physical damage to residential and commercial buildings, schools, critical facilities and infrastructure. • Economic loss, including lost jobs, business interruptions, and repair and reconstruction costs. • Social impacts, including estimates of displaced households, shelter requirements, and populations exposed to floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis. • Cost-effectiveness of common mitigation strategies, such as elevating structures in a floodplain or retrofitting unreinforced masonry buildings.” Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-46City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update There are three modules included with the HAZUS-MH software: hurricane wind, flooding, and earthquakes. There are also three levels at which HAZUS-MH can be run. Level 1 uses national baseline data and is the quickest way to begin the risk assessment process. The analysis that follows was completed using Level 1 data. Level 1 relies upon default data on building types, utilities, transportation, etc. from national databases as well as census data. While the databases include a wealth of information on the City of Everett, it does not capture all relevant information. In fact, the HAZUS training manual notes that the default data is “subject to a great deal of uncertainty.” However, for the purposes of this plan, the analysis is useful. This plan is attempting to only generally indicate the possible extent of damages due to certain types of natural disasters and to allow for a comparison between different types of disasters. Therefore, this analysis should be considered to be a starting point for understanding potential damages from the hazards. If interested, communities can build a more accurate database and further test disaster scenarios. It is expected that the City of Everett will advance this analysis as part of an upcoming Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) to support flood resilience projects at the Island End River. 4.11.2 ESTIMATED DAMAGES FROM EARTHQUAKES The HAZUS earthquake module allows users to define an earthquake magnitude and model the potential damages caused by that earthquake as if its epicenter had been at the geographic center of the study area. For the purposes of this plan, an earthquake with a magnitude 5.3 was selected. Historically, major earthquakes are rare in New England, though a magnitude 5.3 event occurred in 1963. In summary, an earthquake of this magnitude would likely cause nearly $1 billion dollars in damages, including damage to regional transportation infrastructure, municipal utility infrastructure, and community-wide facility damages. The full results of the analysis for Everett are summarized in Appendix C: Risk Assessment Materials. 4.11.3 ESTIMATED DAMAGES FROM FLOODING While HAZUS outputs related to flooding are included in Appendix C: Risk Assessment Materials, the LPC decided ultimately not to limit estimated flood damages from HAZUS based upon the limited extent of the current FEMA 100- year floodplain while the latest Middlesex County flood maps are published (formerly anticipated in 2020). This flood map update will significantly extend the mapped floodplain in Everett to match the 2016 Suffolk County update that triggered significant expansion of the regulated floodplain in the City of Chelsea. Current flood mapping highlights the significant divided in the level of flood map accuracy at the Island End River where the portion of the New England Produce Center within Chelsea is mapped and the portion in Everett is not mapped despite Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-47City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update matching topographic elevations below the Suffolk County Base Flood Elevation (BFE) of Elevation 10.00 NAVD88. Approximately 18.9% of the City’s land area, and approximately 62 buildings worth an estimated $429,952,200 were identified by the LPC as areas were where flooding most frequently occurs based upon the anticipated 2020 mapped FEMA 100-year floodplain. Based upon FEMA guidance, the estimated losses in this area would range from 10% ($42,995,220) and 50% ($214,976,100) of total building value. Approximately 62.6% of the City’s land area, and approximately 1,067 buildings worth an estimated $972,165,000 were identified by the LPC as areas where flooding is projected to frequently occur in 2070 time-horizon based the Massachusetts Coastal – Flood Risk Model. Based upon FEMA guidance, the estimated losses in this area would range from 10% ($97,165,000) and 50% ($486,082,500) of total building value. These estimated damages are limited to coastal flood impacts do not include inland urban flooding, which has not been accurately modeled in Everett to date. The City of Everett is currently engaging in stormwater modeling efforts for areas of the city that report inland flooding hazards and will update the Plan accordingly with estimate damages and associated mitigation measures as more information is available. 4.11.4 NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP) INSURED STRUCTURES The Massachusetts NFIP Coordinator provided information regarding repetitive loss properties in Everett. A repetitive loss property is a property for which two or more NFIP losses of at least $1,000 each have been paid within any 10-year rolling period since 1978. As of July 2, 2020, there were three repetitive loss properties in Everett. All three were residential properties, with two located in a Zone A flood hazard zone. There has been a total of 11 paid losses, with total losses of $66,457, which is an increase of $5,754 since the 2015 HMP Plan.

It evaluates both current and future opportunities to improve capabilities as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): 1. Planning and regulatory capabilities based on the implementation of ordinances, policies, local laws and State statues, and plans and programs that relate to guiding and managing growth and development. 2. Administrative and technical capabilities associated with the City’s staff and their skills and their tools that can be used for mitigation planning and to implement specific mitigation actions. 3. Financial capabilities that include the resources the City has access to or is eligible to use to fund mitigation actions. 4. Education and outreach capabilities resulting from programs and methods already in place that could be used to implement mitigation activities and communicate hazard-related information. 5.2 PLANNING AND REGULATORY CAPABILITIES Planning and regulatory capabilities include the local plans, codes, ordinances, policies, and programs that mitigate the impact of natural hazards. With input from the Local Planning Committee (LPC) and Stakeholder Working Group, the following table provides an inventory of the available resources that impact Everett’s ability to mitigate risk. The relative effectiveness of each resources is ranked on a scale from “Most Effective” through “Somewhat Effective” to “Least Effective” in its potential ability to address potential hazards in Everett based upon its current form/structure/use. Additional notes on each resource, including ways to supplement or enhance the effectiveness of the resource, are included in Table 5-1, Planning and Regulatory Capabilities.

Chapter 5: Capability Assessment 5-4City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Some opportunities to expand planning and regulatory capabilities in the City of Everett include the following: • Execute proposed ordinance updates and regulations updates/creation related to floodplain overlay district (to include projected 2070 floodplain area to encourage resilient development practices, including elevation/modification of critical infrastructure and new development or significant renovations, use of floodproofing strategies, and other techniques) and green standards (to promote use of low- impact development practices and nature-based solutions/green infrastructure throughout the community). • Update Everett Open and Recreation Space Plan to incorporate hazard mitigation planning considerations in development/acquisition of new public open space, the renovation of existing open spaces, and the use of nature-based solutions/green infrastructure in all public open spaces. Continued partnership with the Mystic River Watershed Association (MyRWA) and neighboring communities could support these initiatives. • Update community plans focused on housing to include hazard mitigation planning considerations. • Partner with non-profit organizations, such as Everett Community Growers to promote continued implementation of the Community Food Assessment & Plan. Continued investment in community gardens and other urban agriculture opportunities have the potential to mitigation urban heat island and stormwater flooding issues in the City of Everett. 5.3 ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES Everett is governed by a Mayor and a City Council consisting of six ward councilors and five councilors-at-large. City departments, boards, and committees provide full-time and part-time employees, as well as volunteer appointments, that are critical to the implementation of Everett’s risk reduction. Everett additionally works closely with many state agencies and neighboring communities through collaborative regional partnerships. Organizations such as the Mystic River Watershed Association (MyRWA) are integral to this work. With input from the LPC and Stakeholder Working Group, the following table provides an inventory of the available resources that impact Everett’s ability to mitigate risk. Additional notes on each resource, including ways to supplement or enhance the effectiveness of the resource, are included in Table 5-2, Administrative and Technical Capabilities.

Chapter 5: Capability Assessment 5-18Chapter 6 MITIGATION GOALS AND STRATEGIESCity of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 6: MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES 6.1 INTRODUCTION Hazard mitigation refers to “any sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate the long- term risk to human life and property from hazardous conditions.” The mitigation goals and strategies set by the City of Everett through its 2015 Hazard Mitigation Plan are presented in this chapter along with updated goals and strategies to address current hazards and the projected impacts of climate change. Everett’s mitigation goals and strategies were updated based upon the results of the hazard identification and risk assessment presented in Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment. 6.2 EXISTING MITIGATION GOALS The purpose of the Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update (the “2021 HMP Update” or “Plan”) is to provide the City of Everett with an assessment of the natural hazards it has experienced in the 2015-2021 period, as well as strategies to reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property damage resulting from likely future hazards, including those hazards exasperated by the impacts of climate change. With a robust community engagement process and a comprehensive inventory of Everett’s existing mitigation tools, the 2021 HMP Update suggests improvements to the City’s planning, policy, and programs to reduce vulnerability and risk. In the 2015 HMP Update Plan, the City of Everett identified the following nine mitigation goals for the community: 1. Prevent and reduce the loss of life, injury, and property damages resulting for all major natural hazards. 2. Identify and seek funding for measures to mitigate or eliminate each known significant flood hazard area. 3. Integrate hazard mitigation planning as an integral factor in all relevant municipal departments, committees, and boards. • Ensure that the Planning Department considers hazard mitigation in its review and permitting of new development. • Review zoning regulations to ensure that ordinance incorporates all reasonable hazard mitigation provisions. • Ensure that all relevant municipal departments have the resources to continue to enforce codes and regulations related to hazard mitigation. 4. Prevent and reduce the damage to public infrastructure resulting from all hazards Chapter 6: Mitigation Goals & Strategies 6-1City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update • Begin to assess the vulnerability of municipal buildings and infrastructure to damage from an earthquake. • Maintain existing mitigation infrastructure in good condition. 5. Encourage the business community, major institutions, and non-profits to work with the City to develop, review, and implement the hazard mitigation plan. 6. Work with surrounding communities, state, regional, and federal agencies to ensure regional cooperation and solutions for hazards affecting multiple communities. • Continue to participate in the Mystic Region Regional Emergency Planning Committee (REPC). 7. Ensure that future development meets federal, state, and local standards for preventing and reducing the impacts of natural hazards. 8. Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures that can be undertaken by property owners. • Provide information on hazard mitigation activities in languages most frequently spoken in Everett. 9. Take maximum advantage of resources from FEMA and MEMA to educate City staff and the public about hazard mitigation. 6.3 UPDATED MITIGATION GOALS Through discussions with the Local Planning Committee (LPC), the majority of the 2015 HMP Update goals were reconfirmed as ongoing goals of the community. Minor modifications were suggested to adapt specific text to current conditions as follows: 1. Prevent and reduce the loss of life, injury, and property damages resulting for all major natural hazards. 2. Identify and seek funding for measures to mitigate or eliminate each known significant flood hazard area. 3. Integrate hazard mitigation planning as an integral factor in all relevant municipal departments, committees, and boards. • Review zoning regulations to ensure that ordinance incorporates all reasonable hazard mitigation provisions. • Ensure that all relevant municipal departments have the resources to continue to enforce codes and regulations related to hazard mitigation. 4. Prevent and reduce the damage to public infrastructure resulting from all hazards, incorporating a particular focus on flooding and extreme heat hazards, which are likely to intensify due to climate change. 5. Encourage the business community, major institutions, and non-profits to work with the City to develop, review, and implement the hazard mitigation plan. Chapter 6: Mitigation Goals & Strategies 6-2City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 6. Work with surrounding communities, state, regional, and federal agencies to ensure regional cooperation and solutions for hazards affecting multiple communities. • Continue to partner with the City of Chelsea to focus on the significant coastal flood hazards occurring now and in the future at the Island End River. 7. Ensure that future development meets federal, state, and local standards for preventing and reducing the impacts of natural hazards. 8. Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures that can be undertaken by property owners. • Provide information on hazard mitigation activities in languages most frequently spoken in Everett. 9. Take maximum advantage of resources from FEMA, MEMA, and other state agencies to fund large-scale hazard mitigation projects. 6.4 EXISITING MITIGATION PROJECTS & STRATEGIES The 2015 Hazard Mitigation Plan Update included recommendations for several potential hazard mitigation strategies and projects for the City to pursue between 2015 and 2020 as shown in Table 6-1, Existing Mitigation Strategies.

Chapter 6: Mitigation Goals & Strategies 6-5City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update The City of Everett takes a holistic approach to addressing hazard mitigation. By working across communities, City departments, and demographics, the City has begun a comprehensive effort to mitigate risk from urban and coastal flooding, high heat, severe storm events, and more. Specifically, to address the current consistent threat of flooding near the Island End River (IER), the City Everett and its regional partner, the City of Chelsea, has both independently and collaboratively pursued planning and infrastructure projects to improve the resilience of the IER area. Several projects in the Industrial District/Designated Port Area are already underway, including: • DPA Industrial District Master Planning - The Everett Industrial District/ Designated Port Area is used primarily for wholesale produce, a deep-water petroleum and liquid natural gas port, and heavy construction and material recycling businesses. This master plan study will involve developing an understanding of current businesses and operations, uncovering new economic development strategies, and crafting a comprehensive implementation plan. • Market Street Culvert Tide Gate at IER Outfall- Two corrugated metal culverts, one on Market Street and one on Beacham Street, were installed decades ago when the IER was filled in. As these culverts fail, the river is “self-daylighting”—breaking through the surface of the NEPC parking lots in unpredictable and dangerous ways. The culvert backs up with seawater and floods inland neighborhoods of Everett and Chelsea during storm events and astronomical high tides. The City of Everett is pursuing funding for a new tide gate to prevent this saltwater flooding into urban neighborhoods. This part of the project is essential for the rest of the coastal flood management strategy to work; otherwise water will pour in behind flood barriers via the stormwater system. • Market Street Culvert Improvements - Constructed in 1965, Market Street culvert carries the old IER from an open drainage channel north of the Boston Market Terminal, across the site, and under Market Street to an outfall at the IER in Chelsea. Flooding has been a problem in the area for many years due to this culvert deteriorating and several sections of it collapsing. The Cities of Everett and Chelsea are partnering with a private landowner to replace the existing corrugated metal arch with a reinforced box culvert, and daylight a 400 linear-foot section of the river. The Market Street culvert repairs will improve its ability to manage intense precipitation events. The daylighted, landscaped portion of the channel will provide social benefits, including reducing summer heat and providing much-needed public open space. • MBTA Culvert Repairs - The MBTA stormwater culvert northeast of Boston Market Terminal at 34 Market Street site was repaired in 2020 as part of activities in the City of Everett's proposed 20-Year Capital Improvement Recommended Plan. In 2021, the City of Everett will continue discussions with the MBTA about the Chapter 6: Mitigation Goals & Strategies 6-6City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update installation of additional relief drains underneath the MBTA tracks in the Spring Street area and removal of broken tide gate structures that cause stormwater to back up and increase surface flooding. 6.5 UPDATED MITIGATION STRATEGIES The LPC and Stakeholder Working Group participants reviewed recent mitigation prioritizes identified in the Community Resilience Building Summary of Findings report prepared as part of the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) program in 2019. The LPC further refined the list of mitigation strategies to include • The Title of Mitigation Measure and Hazard addressed by the mitigation measure; • A Description of the mitigation measure; • Implementation Responsibility; • Potential Partners; • Time Frame for implementation of mitigation measure; • Estimated Cost of implementing mitigation measure categorized as follows: Very high (over $10 million) o High ($1 million - $10 million) o Medium ($100,000 - $1 million) o Low ($50,000 - $100,000) o Very low (under $50,000) o • Potential Funding Source or Supporting Agency (through Technical Assistance) These designations reflect discussion and a consensus developed by the LPC with input from stakeholders but could change as conditions in the community change over time. The impact of climate change is likely to intensify natural hazards and may lead to a change in prioritization of the next five years. The LPC will continue to review and maintain this list of prioritized mitigation measures to adjust to changing conditions in Everett. The information on potential funding sources shown in Table 6-2; Updated Mitigation Strategies, is preliminary and dependent on available funding per fiscal year. Many mitigation strategies will require multiple funding sources and identification of a potential funding source in Table 6-2 does not guarantee that a project will be eligible for or selected for funding. Upon adoption of this plan, the LPC is responsible for implementation should begin to explore the funding sources in more detail.

Chapter 6: Mitigation Goals & Strategies 6-15Chapter 7 PLAN ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCECity of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 7: PLAN ADOPTION & MAINTENANCE 7.1 PLAN ADOPTION The Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan was adopted by the City Council on Month Date, Year. See Certificate of Adoption at the start of the Plan for documentation. The Plan was approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Month Date, Year for a period of five years. The Plan is set to expire on Month Date, Year. 7.2 PLAN MAINTENANCE While many of the mitigation measures from the City's previous Hazard Mitigation Plan have been implemented since that plan was adopted there has not been an ongoing local process to guide implementation of the plan. Additionally, there were no members of the previous Local Planning Committee (LPC) still serving in their roles in Everett at the time of this plan update. Over the next five years, it will be key to have an established process for the implementation of this plan update. Fort Point Associates (a Tetra Tech Company) worked with the Everett LPC and Stakeholder Working Group to prepare this plan. After approval of the plan by FEMA, the City of Everett will combine this plan implementation with an existing Core Team established for the Massachusetts EEA MVP program, with the Conservation Agent designated as the coordinator. The Core Team meets at minimum quarterly to fulfill other grant program obligations that overlap the areas of interest in the hazard mitigation plan, including climate resilience, municipal preparedness, and public education centered around natural and climate-enhanced hazards. Core Team members will continue to participate in regional and state-based meetings/trainings to stay current with best practices for mitigating risk. These meetings/trainings may include those with the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), the Regional Emergency Planning Committee, Resilient Mystic Collaborative, and others. Additional members could be added to the Core Team from businesses, non-profit organizations, and other entities. The City will continue encourage public participation throughout the five-year implementation of this plan and in the review and update process. As updates and a review of the plan are conducted by the Core Team, these will be placed on the City’s web site ,, a hard copy of the Plan and all updates will be available for viewing at Everett City Hall, and the Plan and all updates will be promoted on the City’s social media accounts. Any public meetings associated with this work will be publicly noticed in accordance with local and state open meeting laws. The City of Everett agrees to update and adopt this mitigation plan on a five-year basis. This update will include a comprehensive review and planning process like the one used Chapter 7: Plan Adoption and Maintenance 7-1City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update to develop the Plan. This process includes updating land use practices, collecting, and reviewing best available data, reviewing the capability assessment, engaging the public and relevant stakeholders, and updating the mitigation strategies. This process will occur according to the latest FEMA guidelines. The City of Everett will establish funding for the development of the plan update a year before the Plan expires in 2026. The Conservation Agent will serve as the Project Manager for the update process. 7.3 IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION SCHEDULE Plan Implementation Survey – The Conservation Agent will prepare and distribute a survey in year three of the Plan. The plan implementation survey will be distributed to all LPC members and other interested local stakeholders. The survey will poll the members on any changes or revisions to the plan that may be needed, progress and accomplishments for implementation, and any new hazards or risks as identified in the City of Everett. This information will be used to prepare a report or addendum to the local hazard mitigation plan to evaluate its effectiveness in meeting the plan’s goals and objectives and to identify areas that need to be updated in the next plan. The Core Team, led by the Conservation Agent, will have primary responsibility for tracking progress, evaluating, and updating the plan. Prepare for the next Plan Update – FEMA’s approval of this plan is valid for five years, by which time an updated plan must be approved by FEMA to maintain the town’s approved plan status and its eligibility for FEMA hazard mitigation grants. Given the lead time needed to secure funding and conduct the planning process, the Core Team will begin to prepare for an update of the plan in year three. This will help the City avoid any lapse in its approved plan status and grant eligibility when the current Plan expires in 2026. Prepare and Adopt an Updated Local Hazard Mitigation Plan – Once the resources have been secured to update the plan, the Core Team will hire a consultant team to lead the plan update. The Core Team will review the latest FEMA hazard mitigation plan guidelines for guidance in updating the mitigation plan. The Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update will be forwarded to MEMA for review and to FEMA for approval. 7.4 INTEGRATION OF PLAN WITH OTHER PLANNING EFFORTS Upon approval of the Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update by FEMA, the Core Team will provide all interested parties and implementing departments with a copy of the Plan and will initiate a discussion regarding how the plan can be integrated into each department’s ongoing efforts. Chapter 7: Plan Adoption and Maintenance 7-2City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update At a minimum, the plan will be reviewed and discussed with the following departments: • Fire • Police • Public Works • Planning • Health • Building • Recreation Other groups that will be coordinated with include representatives of local businesses, the Everett Chamber of Commerce, nonprofit organizations, and other stakeholders. The Plan will also be posted on the City’s website and promoted on the City’s social media accounts. The posting of the plan on the City website will include a mechanism for citizen feedback such as an e-mail address to send comments to the attention of the Conservation Agent. The Hazard Mitigation Plan will be integrated into other city plans and policies as they are updated and renewed, including the Everett Open Space and Recreation Plan, the latest Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP), upcoming housing plans, and other initiatives.

The primary purpose of Hazus is to provide a methodology and software application to develop multi-hazard losses at a regional scale. These loss estimates would be used primarily by local, state and regional officials to plan and stimulate efforts to reduce risks from multi-hazards and to prepare for emergency response and recovery. The earthquake loss estimates provided in this report was based on a region that includes 1 county(ies) from the following state(s): Massachusetts Note: Appendix A contains a complete listing of the counties contained in the region. The geographical size of the region is 3.54 square miles and contains 8 census tracts. There are over 15 thousand households in the region which has a total population of 41,667 people (2010 Census Bureau data). The distribution of population by Total Region and County is provided in Appendix B. There are an estimated 9 thousand buildings in the region with a total building replacement value (excluding contents) of 4,405 (millions of dollars). Approximately 89.00 % of the buildings (and 71.00% of the building value) are associated with residential housing. The replacement value of the transportation and utility lifeline systems is estimated to be 675 and 955 (millions of dollars) , respectively. Earthquake Global Risk Report Page 3 of 21Building and Lifeline Inventory Building Inventory Hazus estimates that there are 9 thousand buildings in the region which have an aggregate total replacement value of 4,405 (millions of dollars) . Appendix B provides a general distribution of the building value by Total Region and County. In terms of building construction types found in the region, wood frame construction makes up 72% of the building inventory. The remaining percentage is distributed between the other general building types. Critical Facility Inventory Hazus breaks critical facilities into two (2) groups: essential facilities and high potential loss facilities (HPL). Essential facilities include hospitals, medical clinics, schools, fire stations, police stations and emergency operations facilities. High potential loss facilities include dams, levees, military installations, nuclear power plants and hazardous material sites. For essential facilities, there are 1 hospitals in the region with a total bed capacity of beds. There are 14 schools, 3 fire stations, 1 police stations and 2 emergency operation facilities. With respect to high potential loss facilities (HPL), there are no dams identified within the inventory. The inventory also includes 22 hazardous material sites, no military installations and no nuclear power plants. Transportation and Utility Lifeline Inventory Within Hazus, the lifeline inventory is divided between transportation and utility lifeline systems. There are seven (7) transportation systems that include highways, railways, light rail, bus, ports, ferry and airports. There are six (6) utility systems that include potable water, wastewater, natural gas, crude & refined oil, electric power and communications. The lifeline inventory data are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The total value of the lifeline inventory is over 1,630.00 (millions of dollars).

(1) None of your facilities were flooded. This can be checked by mapping the inventory data on the depth grid. (2) The analysis was not run. This can be tested by checking the run box on the Analysis Menu and seeing if a message box asks you to replace the existing results. Flood Global Risk Report Page 10 of 16Induced Flood Damage Debris Generation Hazus estimates the amount of debris that will be generated by the flood. The model breaks debris into three general categories: 1) Finishes (dry wall, insulation, etc.), 2) Structural (wood, brick, etc.) and 3) Foundations (concrete slab, concrete block, rebar, etc.). This distinction is made because of the different types of material handling equipment required to handle the debris. Analysis has not been performed for this Scenario. Flood Global Risk Report Page 11 of 16Social Impact Shelter Requirements Hazus estimates the number of households that are expected to be displaced from their homes due to the flood and the associated potential evacuation. Hazus also estimates those displaced people that will require accommodations in temporary public shelters. The model estimates 0 households (or 0 of people) will be displaced due to the flood. Displacement includes households evacuated from within or very near to the inundated area. Of these, 0 people (out of a total population of 41,667) will seek temporary shelter in public shelters. Displaced Population/Persons Seeking Short Term Public Shelter 0 Persons Seeking Shelter Displaced Population 0 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 Flood Global Risk Report Page 12 of 16Economic Loss The total economic loss estimated for the flood is 0.52 million dollars, which represents 0.45 % of the total replacement value of the scenario buildings. Building - Related Losses The building losses are broken into two categories: direct building losses and business interruption losses. The direct building losses are the estimated costs to repair or replace the damage caused to the building and its contents. The business interruption losses are the losses associated with inability to operate a business because of the damage sustained during the flood. Business interruption losses also include the temporary living expenses for those people displaced from their homes because of the flood. 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 The total building-related losses were 0.31 million dollars. 40% of the estimated losses were related to the business interruption of the region. The residential occupancies made up 0.00% of the total loss. Table 6 below provides a summary of the losses associated with the building damage.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Hazard mitigation is defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as “any sustainable action that reduces or eliminates long-term risk to people and property from future disasters.”1 Mitigation plans are focused on creating a collaborative, locally- specific study that identifies risks and vulnerabilities associated with natural hazards in order to diminish their likely financial and personal impacts on the community. Under the requirements of the Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, hazard mitigation plans must be updated and re-submitted to FEMA every five years for a locality or state to maintain funding eligibility. PLANNING PROCESS The Local Planning Committee (LPC), comprised of members of city staff, lead the Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update (the “2021 HMP Update” or “Plan”) planning effort. The LPC was supported by a group of local stakeholders, including members of the business community, neighboring municipal staff members, nonprofit organizations, relevant state agencies, and other participants who guided this work. In total, more than a half dozen meetings were held with city officials and stakeholders as the 2015 Plan was reviewed in full and the updated Plan began to take form. To broaden the spectrum of community input in this hazard mitigation planning process, a robust community survey was prepared in three languages – English, Portuguese, and Spanish. The survey was launched in late 2020 and was open for different periods coordinated with other public engagements through the end of the planning process in July 2021. The City of Everett communications team periodically advertised the community survey in three distinct timeframes - December 2020/January 2021, near Earth Day in April 2021, and in July 2021. Input from the community was gathered continuously to inform this update and is featured in the Plan. The Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update is also strongly guided by public outreach and education within the Everett community. Two workshops were conducted, one in December 2020 and another in July 2021. These workshops brought a mix of the LPC, a wide range of stakeholders, and the full Everett Community Growers urban agriculture nonprofit staff, including their high school student interns, into this hazard mitigation planning. 1 https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation Executive Summary 1",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Additionally, an advertised public meeting was held on July 15, 2021 with the Everett Conservation Commission. During this meeting, the Commission and the public received an update on the hazard mitigation planning process, reviewed the risk assessment, and discussed current and future mitigation projects. The draft Plan was posted on the City’s website for a period of ten days from July 22, 2021 through July 31, 2021. RISK ASSESSMENT The Plan provides risk assessment for the following natural hazards in Everett: flooding, landslides, drought, severe thunderstorms, severe winter storms, dam failures, and earthquakes. The Plan also considered projected coastal flood and coastal hazard risks associated with sea level rise impacts and increasing heat hazards due to climate change. This evaluation focused on the 2030 and 2070 time horizons for coastal flooding and the 2050 time horizon for extreme heat impacts. Approximately 18.9% of the City’s land area, and approximately 62 buildings worth an estimated $429,952,200 were identified by the LPC as areas were where flooding most frequently occurs based upon the anticipated 2020 mapped FEMA 100-year floodplain. Based upon FEMA guidance, the estimated losses in this area would range from 10% ($42,995,220) and 50% ($214,976,100) of total building value. Approximately 62.6% of the City’s land area, and approximately 1,067 buildings worth an estimated $972,165,000 were identified by the LPC as areas where flooding is projected to frequently occur in 2070 time-horizon based the Massachusetts Coastal – Flood Risk Model. Based upon FEMA guidance, the estimated losses in this area would range from 10% ($97,165,000) and 50% ($486,082,500) of total building value. MITIGATION GOALS The Plan is guided by nine Mitigation Goals, which build upon the nine goals endorsed in the 2015 HMP Update. These goals broadly represent the community’s priorities and vision for mitigating the risk of natural hazards in Everett as follows: 1. Prevent and reduce the loss of life, injury and property damages resulting from all major natural hazards. 2. Identify and seek funding for measures to mitigate or eliminate each known significant flood hazard area. 3. Integrate hazard mitigation planning as an integral factor in all relevant municipal departments, committees, and boards. • Review zoning regulations to ensure that the ordinance incorporates all reasonable hazard mitigation provisions. • Ensure that all relevant municipal departments have the resources to continue to enforce codes and regulations related to hazard mitigation. Executive Summary 2",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4. Prevent and reduce the damage to public infrastructure resulting from all hazards, incorporating a particular focus on flooding and extreme heat hazards, which are likely to intensify due to climate change. 5. Encourage the business community, major institutions, and non-profits to work with the City to develop, review and implement the hazard mitigation plan. 6. Work with surrounding communities, state, regional and federal agencies to ensure regional cooperation and solutions for hazards affecting multiple communities. • Continue to partner with the City of Chelsea to focus on the significant coastal flood hazards occurring now and in the future at the Island End River. 7. Ensure that future development meets federal, state, and local standards for preventing and reducing the impacts of natural hazards. 8. Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures that can be undertaken by property-owners. • Provide information on hazard mitigation activities in the languages most frequently spoken in Everett. 9. Take maximum advantage of resources from FEMA, MEMA, and other federal and state agencies to fund large-scale hazard mitigation projects KEY HAZARD MITIGATION ACTIONS The following mitigation actions were highlighted through this Plan: - Constructing a coastal flood barrier near the Island End River to protect regional food distribution hub and surrounding industrial area from storm surge. - Complete repair of the Market and Beacham Street culverts near the Island End River and identify needed tide gate and pump station infrastructure in this corridor. - Upgrade stormwater pipe infrastructure in the Second Street corridor to alleviate flooding and treat stormwater runoff. - Model stormwater flood risk throughout the City to identify additional mitigation projects needed. - Implement new floodplain overlay district zoning to incorporate sustainable planning into new developments and significant renovations into Chapter 9 of the Everett General Ordinances – Flood Damage Prevention. - Implement a green standard for the City that incorporates updated engineering design guides and eventually a zoning ordinance that incentivizes the use of low impact development strategies and nature-based solutions in new developments and significant renovations.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update PLAN REVIEW AND UPDATE PROCESS Table 1-1: Plan Review and Update Chapter Reviews and Updates III – Public Public participation was a key feature of the Plan. In addition to the LPC, a Participation Stakeholder Working Group comprised of local business leaders, nonprofit organizations, neighboring municipal staffs, state agency representatives, and others led this Plan. The City of Everett focused on reaching out to the community in their primary written and/or spoken language to gather feedback. A community survey was conducted in English, Portuguese, and Spanish and was open for different periods coordinated with other public engagements through the end of the planning process. It was promoted on the City’s social media accounts, shared through LPC and stakeholder listservs and other connections, and available on the City website. An advertised public meeting was held in coordination with the Everett Conservation Commission in July 2021. The Plan was also available on the City’s website. IV – Risk The Consultant Team gathered recent available hazard and land use data and Assessment met with the LPC to identify any recent changes in land use and development trends. The critical infrastructure list was updated to incorporate new features and eliminate any facilities that were no longer operational in Everett. The best available projected coastal flood mapping from the State of Massachusetts’s endorsed MC-FRM was analyzed as part of this plan review and update. The latest version of HAZUS was also used to evaluate flooding and earthquake hazards. V - Goals The Hazard Mitigation Goals were reviewed and updated by the LPC. VI – Existing The list of existing mitigation measures was updated to reflect current Mitigation mitigation activities in the City. Measures VII & VIII – Mitigation measures from the 2015 Plan were reviewed to identify the status Hazard (complete, ongoing, or deferred) of each measure. The LPC identified Mitigation additional mitigation measures to support these efforts and new mitigation Strategy measures to address growing hazards due to the impacts of climate change. Mitigation measures were reprioritized based upon LPC, stakeholder, and community input. IX – Plan This section of the Plan was updated with a new implementation plan and five Adoption & year update process that will aid the City in continuing their progress tackling Maintenance hazard mitigation measures throughout the City. Some mitigation measures, such as the construction of a large-scale coastal flood resilience barrier at the Island End River, will require significant monetary investment.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1.1 PLANNING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FEDERAL DISASTER MITIGATION ACT Each year, natural disasters in the United States cause loss of life and damage to infrastructure and property at the local, state, and federal levels. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), established in 1979, has a primary purpose to not only respond to these disasters when they strike, but to prepare for and protect against the impacts of natural hazards such as floods, storms, and extreme temperatures before they turn into disasters. To aid this effort, FEMA provides technical and financial natural disaster assistance to state and local governments through the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988 (Stafford Act). The law as originally adopted authorized the President of the United States to declare an emergency at the local and state levels following a natural disaster, thereby allowing Congressional funds and federal assistance to be provided. Recognizing that proactively planning for natural disasters would allow local, tribal, and state communities to reduce their vulnerability to loss of life and property, Congress further amended the Stafford Act with the Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 on October 30, 2000. The law requires that after November 1, 2004, municipalities who wish to be eligible for certain types of FEMA funding must adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan. Hazard mitigation is defined by FEMA as “any sustainable action that reduces or eliminates long-term risk to people and property from future disasters.”1 Mitigation plans are focused on creating a collaborative, locally-specific study that identifies risks and vulnerabilities associated with natural hazards in order to diminish their likely financial and personal impacts. Hazard mitigation plans must be updated and re-submitted to FEMA every five years for a locality or state to maintain funding eligibility. The City of Everett has formally participated in local hazard mitigation planning since 2004, when it and eight other Metro Boston communities developed the Metro Boston Multi- Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan under the guidance of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC). This regional plan allowed the neighboring communities to jointly identify inter-community hazard mitigation issues during the early years of the Federal Disaster Mitigation Act. On September 23, 2015, the City of Everett individually filed a Hazard Mitigation Plan Update (the “2015 HMP Update”) with FEMA in compliance with the requirements of the 1 https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation Chapter 1: Introduction 1-1",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Federal Disaster Mitigation Act. Based on the State of Massachusetts’ prior regional approach, the 2015 HMP Update built upon the multijurisdictional MAPC plan and was the first document prepared solely for the City of Everett. This document serves as an update to the 2015 HMP Update as required by FEMA. 1.2 PURPOSE OF THE PLAN The purpose of the Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update (the “2021 HMP Update” or “Plan”) is to provide the City of Everett with an assessment of the natural hazards it has experienced in the 2015-2021 period, as well as strategies to reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property damage resulting from likely future hazards, including those hazards exasperated by the impacts of climate change. With a robust community engagement process and a comprehensive inventory of Everett’s existing mitigation tools, the 2021 HMP Update suggests improvements to the City’s planning, policy, and programs to reduce vulnerability and risk. The City of Everett has experienced 22 hazards that triggered federal or state disaster declarations since 1991. These are listed in Table 1-1, Previous Federal/State Disaster Declarations and are reflective of the most significant hazard within the community consistently being flood hazards.

        "Chapter 2 COMMUNITY PROFILE",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 2: COMMUNITY PROFILE 2.1 INTRODUCTION Everett was settled in 1630, established as a town in 1870, and incorporated as a city in 1892. Located in Middlesex County, it is bordered by the city of Malden to the north, the cities of Chelsea and Revere to the east, the Malden River to the west, and the Mystic River to the south. The Charlestown neighborhood of the City of Boston and the Assembly Square neighborhood of the City of Somerville are located across the Mystic River. Everett is bisected by a major roadway, Route 16/Revere Beach Parkway, which runs east/west from Medford through Everett and into Chelsea. The city is close to Interstate Highways 93 and 95, has 60 miles of public roads, and is served by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Boston’s Logan International Airport is approximately 15 minutes away by car. Map 2-1 shows Everett and its road network within the regional context. It is a small city of 3.5 square miles, yet the City of Everett able to provide a high level of educational, public safety, public works and recreational services to its residents at a modest tax rate. The City's public facilities include seven elementary schools, one junior high school, and one senior high school, which offers a vocational education program. Water and sewer services are provided by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). A blue-collar working-class community, Everett has served as a gateway city to immigrants for most of its history. The community has a diversified industrial and commercial base. Everett industry contributes significantly to the economic well-being of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with many of its companies producing and servicing products in use world-wide. Everett’s employment is concentrated in industries associated with its Designated Port Area (DPA) along the Mystic River; in food produce distribution, reflecting the presence of the New England Produce Center and surrounding facilities at Beacham and Market Streets, and in a range of service and retail establishments, especially those serving health care and social services. Many of these jobs are located in industrial and commercial spaces within the city’s waterfront along the Mystic River. Table 2-1 provides a snapshot of the demographics within Everett. Chapter 2: Community Profile 2-1",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Table 2-1: Estimated Everett Characteristics Population = 46,118 • 22% are under the age of 18 • 11% are over the age of 65 • 30% speak English less than “very well” • 18% of households have no vehicle Number of Housing Units = 16,021 • 61% are renter-occupied housing units • 63% of housing units were built before 1940 Source: U.S. Census, 2019 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates 2.2 GEOGRAPHY The City of Everett is bound by two major rivers – the Mystic River along the City’s southern perimeter and the Malden River along the City’s western perimeter. The Island End River (IER) is a tributary to the Mystic River and is located south of the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) Amelia Earhart Dam. The dam provides an important tidal management resource on the Mystic River to control upstream flooding in the Mystic River watershed. The community recognizes these rivers as an important source of strength and vulnerability within the community because of the resources they provide and the challenges they present for the City of Everett. Map 2-2 provides an aerial view of the city. These rivers are an important regional asset for food security and job creation centered around a thriving produce distribution industry at the New England Produce Center. These rivers also serve as a gateway to connect the City of Everett to recent economic development across the Mystic River in Somerville and to public open space along the Mystic and Malden Rivers in Medford and Malden. The IER has been significantly altered historically by industrial development and associated fill activities for sites like the New England Produce Center where the river was culverted in 1968. Due to lack of maintenance and the impacts of significant uncontrolled stormwater and tidal flows, the Market Street Culvert at the New England Produce Center is failing with several collapsed pipe sections and exposed sinkhole areas that pose a risk to public safety, the local produce industry, and water quality in the Mystic River. The Cities of Chelsea, Everett, along with other partners are working aggressively to secure funding through FEMA and other federal, state, and non-government agencies to address this aging utility infrastructure. These coastal and riverine resources also present a growing flood risk to the City of Everett. The IER and a portion of the Mystic River south of the DCR Amelia Earhart Dam are tidally influenced and experience storm surge effects from Boston Harbor in major storm events. Relatively flat topographic elevations in Everett and neighboring Chelsea Chapter 2: Community Profile 2-2",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update also present overland pathways for coastal/saltwater flooding to impact areas deeper into the community. 2.3 LAND USE The city is characterized by both densely developed residential neighborhoods bordered by walkable neighborhoods serving commercial retail streets, as well as an intensely used industrial area that includes a power plant and a materials processing facility. There is a large open space in the northeastern portion of the city, comprised of the Woodlawn Cemetery, Beth Israel Cemetery, and Glenwood Cemetery, and smaller parks generally throughout the residential portion of the city. However, this has been changing along the Malden River through recent efforts to increase the amount of public open space and access to the riverfront by Everett’s leadership. The residential neighborhood and commercial areas are generally located in the upland hills while the industrial area is adjacent to the Mystic River and IER. Generally, residential neighborhoods are found north of Route 16. Within the low-lying area near the Mystic River and IER in Everett are a great concentration of largely industrial users: rail yard for MBTA, scrap metal recycling, oil tank farms, and a significant amount of food produce distribution (Beacham Street, Second Street). Population density is highest north of Route 16, within the residential areas of the city, and lowest along the rivers and industrial/commercial areas. Everett is most dense toward center of city and the Broadway corridor. See Map 2-3, Everett Population Density. 2.4 DEMOGRAPHICS The estimated population in Everett was 46,118 residents in 2019. The associated city- wide population density of 13,000 people per square mile assumes an even distribution of the population throughout the city. If the population was assumed to be limited to the residential areas predominantly found north of Route 16, the associated population density would be approximately 23,000 people per square mile. The median household income in Everett is $65,528 (2019 inflation-adjusted dollars). Table 2-2, Workforce Characteristics, compares the characteristics of the city’s working- age population to that of Middlesex County. The city lags the county in educational attainment: 14% of Everett’s workers lack a high school degree compared to 3% in Middlesex County and 22% of Everett workers have a Bachelor’s degree or higher compared to 57% of workers in Middlesex County. However, more of the city’s workers have some high school or a high school degree and more workers with some college or an Associate’s degree than is found in greater Middlesex County.

The state of Massachusetts defines a neighborhood as an EJ population if any of the following conditions are true:1 • Annual median household income is not more than 65% of the statewide annual median households income; • Minorities comprise 40% or more of the population; • 25% or more of households lack English proficiency; or • Minorities comprise 25% or more of the population and the annual median household income of the municipality in which the neighborhood is located does not exceed 150% of the statewide annual median household income. Any or all of these neighborhood characteristics indicate that residents may be at a heightened risk for experiencing environmental hazards, and as such, merit particular attention during environmental resilience planning processes. EJ block groups within Everett include Minority; Minority and Income; Minority and English Isolation; and Minority, Income and English Isolation EJ communities.

The public services and facilities of Everett serve as a foundation for the quality of life for residents and function of the community as a whole. Their adequacy affects the ability of the City to serve the community. As noted above, the City's educational facilities include seven elementary schools, one junior high school, and one senior high school, which offers a vocational education program. The Police Department is centrally located on Elm Street. The Fire Department has three stations: Central Station on Broadway, Hancock Street Station, and Ferry Street Station. Drinking water enters the city from the MWRA’s water distribution in five locations throughout the city. The city’s water distribution system consists of approximately 70 miles of pipe, 724 fire hydrants, and over 8,200 service connections. The city’s wastewater collection system consists of approximately 70 miles of pipe. The city’s wastewater travels via gravity through city pipes and then enters the MWRA’s wastewater collection system where it is transmitted to MWRA’s Deer Island Treatment Plant.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 3: PLANNING PROCESS 3.1 INTRODUCTION The Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) Update planning process provided an opportunity for the City to engage the public and stakeholders to join the City in ensuring their systems, infrastructure, and people are prepared for potential hazards. Outreach and incorporating feedback received creates an engaged community with inherent interest in the long-term quality of their neighborhoods and the quality of municipal infrastructure and services. To create a planning process where public and stakeholder participation is equitable and effective – especially given concerns surrounding COVID-19 – participation was sought through a variety of methods, such as working through partner organizations and using non-traditional outreach methods. To adhere to social distancing and public health guidelines, virtual meetings were used; however, effort was made to engage all community voices, including those that are not frequently represented, such as youth and elderly residents. 3.2 PLANNING TEAM The City of Everett established a Local Planning Committee (LPC) to lead this hazard mitigation planning effort. Members of the LPC, listed in Table 3-1, Local Planning Committee Members, collaborated regularly and was responsible for providing relevant information and data, reviewing the hazard assessment, evaluating goals and objectives for hazard mitigation, participating during stakeholder working group and public workshops and meetings, reviewing and providing comments on the draft Plan, and maintaining the Plan following adoption.

The LPC met via video conference on August 27, 2020 for a kickoff meeting that set expectations for the upcoming update of the Plan, as well as reviewed the core tenets of the 2015 HMP Update Plan. Members of the LPC were familiar with each other as many serve on a similar committee, the Massachusetts Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Core Team, which is focused on similar goals with a more specific lens on climate hazards. See Chapter 7: Plan Adoption and Maintenance for further information on how this established Core Team will support the implementation of mitigation measures and keeping the Plan current going forward. The LPC also met via video conference on November 17, 2020 to prepare an upcoming hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA) workshop in December 2020. Additional information on the HIRA workshop can be found in Section 3.4, Workshops and Public Meetings, below. Prior to the November LPC meeting, members of the LPC also listened in to a video conference meeting with the Stakeholder Working Group on September 9, 2020. Additional information on the Stakeholder Working Group can be found in Section 3.3.1, Stakeholder Working Group, below. On July 13, 2021, the LPC met along with the Stakeholder Working Group in a 90-min session focused on mitigation measures. Members of the LPC, particularly Everett Conservation Agent Tom Philbin who served as the project manager for the project, also met with the consultant team developing the Plan and other stakeholders throughout the project. Going forward the LPC will continue to serve in this role as defined in Chapter 7: Plan Adoption and Maintenance, to support hazard mitigation planning and the implementation of mitigation measures going forward. 3.3 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 3.3.1 STAKEHOLDER WORKING GROUP Stakeholders from throughout the community can provide important perspectives in addition to those of City staff and the public.

Questions solicited information on topics such as hazard preparedness, experience with and concern about hazards, and prioritization of potential mitigation projects. The survey was posted on the City website, promoted on the City’s social media accounts, and distributed by the LPC, Stakeholder Working Group, and other parties to their networks.: The City of Everett focused on reaching out to the community in their primary written and/or spoken language to gather feedback. A community survey was conducted in English, Portuguese, and Spanish and was open for different periods coordinated with other public engagements through the end of the planning process. The survey included opportunities for the public to both answer specific questions and provide broad feedback. A copy of the community survey along with response metrics is included in Appendix B. General trends from the survey responses included a broad spectrum in the level of concern related to flooding and coastal hazards as shown in Figure 3-1: Community Survey Response Data – Concern about Natural Hazard Impacts. These results may indicate a disconnect associated with the fact that majority of residential areas are located outside of the current and projected flood hazard zones. The City of Everett intends to continue to expand public education related to flooding and coastal hazards in Everett to highlight linkages between transportation impacts, economic impacts, and other factors that can also impact residents related to flooding hazards in Everett’s Industrial District.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Figure 3-1: Community Survey Response Data – Concern about Natural Hazard Impacts Overall, survey respondents indicated a strong focus on winter storm events, thunderstorms, and significant wind events. Additional survey feedback focused on mitigation measures to address stormwater flooding at key areas of the city such as Air Force Road, enhanced communications from the City of Everett related to hazards and preparedness and continuing to invest in utility infrastructure resilience. The City of Everett intends to keep the survey open through the public comment period and subsequent agency review of the draft Plan to continue to collect feedback from the community. 3.4.2 PROJECT WORKSHOPS Two workshops were conducted to support the development of the Plan. The first workshop took place on December 10, 2021 and was a two-and-a-half-hour session conducted via Microsoft Teams video conference platform. Attendees at the first workshop included the LPC plus a half dozen other city staff members and the Stakeholder Working Group. Participants attended three district presentations by the consultant team focused on an introduction to hazard mitigation planning, HIRA, and mitigation measures. Between each presentation segment, participants entered smaller breakout groups of approximately 6-8 individuals to discuss the topic and to use ArcGIS online mapping tool to directly assess risks and hazards in Everett. Feedback from participants indicated that use of the ArcGIS online mapping tool developed by the consultant team aided their evaluation of risks and hazards and was an engaging way to solicit meaningful feedback for the Plan.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update The second workshop was conducted on July 8, 2021 and was a 90-minute session conducted via Microsoft Teams video conference platform. Attendees at the second workshop were staff members for a local nonprofit organization, Everett Community Growers (ECG). ECG focuses on urban agriculture and food security in Everett and operates community gardens and a farm stand for the benefit of the community. ECG staff members range from high school age to adult senior staff members and are involved in various roles to support the organization from farm field work to farm stand operations to organizational management. Participants attended three district short presentations by the consultant team focused on an introduction to hazard mitigation planning, HIRA, and mitigation measures. Between each presentation segment, participants entered smaller breakout groups of approximately 4-6 individuals to discuss the topic and to use ArcGIS online mapping tool to directly assess risks and hazards in Everett. Based upon the interests of the participants, the discussion focused on the impact of climate change on urban agriculture and the mitigation benefits of urban agriculture in addressing flooding and heat hazards. 3.4.3 PUBLIC MEETING On July 13, 2021, the Everett Conservation Commission hosted a public meeting to support this project. This meeting was used to engage the community, communicate progress regarding the project timeline and draft Plan, facilitate discussion, solicit information, and receive input and feedback throughout the drafting of the Plan. The meeting was hosted virtually and was available to the entire community. The meeting was properly noticed, posted on the City website, and promoted on the City’s social media accounts.

        "Chapter 4 RISK AND VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 4: RISK ASSESSMENT 4.1 UPDATE PROCESS The risk assessment analyzes the potential natural hazards that could occur within the City of Everett as well as the relationship between those hazards and current land uses, potential future development, and critical infrastructure. This section also includes a vulnerability assessment that estimates the potential damages that could result from certain large-scale natural hazard events. Everett’s risk assessment was updated using the most recently available hazard and land use data and through meetings with City staff, the Local Planning Committee (LPC), and the Stakeholder Working Group to identify changes in local hazard areas and development trends. 4.2 OVERVIEW OF HAZARDS AND IMPACTS The natural hazards within this evaluation were based on those identified in the 2015 Everett HMP, the 2018 Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP)1, and 2019 Everett Community Resilience Building Summary of Findings (resulting from a Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) program planning grant). The SHMCAP integrated the Commonwealth’s traditional hazard mitigation plan, the 2013 Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation Plan, with a climate change adaptation plan, 2011 Massachusetts Climate Change Adaptation Report. The resulting plan included an assessment of the Commonwealth’s natural hazard and climate change vulnerabilities and accounted for projected changes in precipitation, temperature, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. The MVP program2 provides support for cities and towns in Massachusetts to begin the process of planning for climate change resiliency and implementing priority projects. The state awards communities with funding to complete vulnerability assessments and develop action-oriented resiliency plans. Communities who complete the MVP program become certified as an MVP community and are eligible for MVP Action Grant funding and other opportunities. The City of Everett participated in the planning phase of this program starting in 2018 and produced the Everett Community Resilience Building Summary of 1 Massachusetts Integrated State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP) - https://www.mass.gov/service-details/massachusetts-integrated-state-hazard-mitigation-and-climate- adaptation-plan 2 Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness program - https://www.mass.gov/municipal-vulnerability- preparedness-mvp-program Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-1",

This assessment groups the identified natural hazards according to four primary climate change interactions, consistent with the categories used within the SHMCAP: • Changes in Precipitation: Changes in the amount, frequency, and timing of precipitation—including both rainfall and snowfall—are occurring across the globe as temperatures rise and other climate patterns shift in response. • Sea Level Rise: Climate change will drive rising sea levels, and rising seas will have wide-ranging impacts on communities, natural resources, and infrastructure along the Commonwealth’s 1,519 tidal shoreline miles. • Rising Temperatures: Average global temperatures have risen steadily in the last 50 years, and scientists warn that the trend will continue unless greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced. The 9 warmest years on record all occurred in the last 20 years (2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2010, 2009, 2005, and 1998), according to the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)5. • Extreme Weather: Climate change is expected to increase extreme weather events across the globe, as well as right here in Massachusetts. There is strong evidence that storms—from heavy downpours and blizzards to tropical cyclones and hurricanes—are becoming more intense and damaging and can lead to devastating impacts for residents across the state. 5 U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - https://www.noaa.gov/news/2020-was-earth-s-2nd-hottest-year-just-behind-2016 Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-3",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Table 4-2, Climate Change Interactions and Associated Natural Hazards, provides a summary of the climate change interaction categories and the group of applicable natural hazards within this evaluation. The flooding hazard has been divided based on the predominant climate change interaction: riverine and urban flooding have been associated with “Changes in Precipitation,” and coastal flooding has been associated with “Sea Level Rise.” Consistent with the SHMCAP, dam failure and earthquake are not associated with a climate change interaction. Rather, dam failure is considered a technological and human-caused hazard and earthquake is considered a non-climate-influenced hazard. While SHMCAP does not associate dam failure with a climate change interaction, the Mystic River watershed community is focused on the impacts of climate change on the DCR Amelia Earhart Dam infrastructure and its operations. As sea levels rise over the next fifty years, the Dam may experience flanking or overtopping during coastal storm events as shown in flood projections from the Massachusetts Coast – Flood Risk Model6. Flanking is related to storm surge bypassing the dam on the land sides in Somerville and Boston and causing coastal flooding inland and on properties located on/near the non- tidal section of the Mystic River. Overtopping of the dam would occur when the elevation of storm surge extends the top elevation of the dam. An incident of overtopping would render the dam unable to control water elevations on either side of the dam allowing significant amounts of seawater into the Upper Mystic River and Malden River and likely leading to significant damage of dam equipment that would lead to a long recovery. Storm surge into the Upper Mystic River and Malden River would also lead to catastrophic regional flooding into the dozens of upstream communities that are tributary to the Mystic River. State agencies with local municipal support are currently working on interventions to improve the resilience of the dam, including the addition of more pumping infrastructure, protection of existing dam equipment, and land side projects to raise ground elevations in Somerville and Boston adjacent to the dam.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Climate Change Interaction Natural Hazard Not Applicable – Technological Dam Failures and Human-Caused Hazard Not Applicable – Non-Climate- Earthquake Influenced Hazard The Plan uses the following definitions, consistent with the SHMCAP: • Climate change: A change in the state of the climate that can be identified by statistical changes of its properties that persist for an extended period, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. • Exposure: The extent to which something is in direct contact with natural hazards or their related climate change impacts. Exposure is often determined by examining the number of people or assets that lie within a geographic area affected by a natural hazard, or by determining the magnitude of the climate change impact. For example, measurements of flood depth outside a building or number of heat waves experienced by a county are measurements of exposure. • Natural hazard: Natural hazards are natural events that threaten lives, property, and other assets. Often, natural hazards can be predicted. They tend to occur repeatedly in the same geographical locations because they are related to weather patterns or physical characteristics of an area. • Risk: The potential for an unwanted outcome resulting from a hazard event, as determined by its likelihood and associated consequences; and expressed, when possible, in dollar losses. Risk represents potential future losses, based on assessments of probability, severity, and vulnerability. In some instances, dollar losses are based on the actual demonstrated impact. In other cases, dollar losses are demonstrated through exposure analysis due to the inability to determine the extent to which a structure is impacted. • Severity/Extent: The extent or magnitude of a hazard, as measured against an established indicator (e.g., Richter Scale, Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, or Regional Snowfall Index). • Vulnerability: The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected; for example, as applied to building performance (functionality), damage, or the number of people injured. Vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-5",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.3 HAZARDS IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION 4.3.1 RIVERINE AND URBAN FLOODING Riverine and urban flooding was the most prevalent serious natural hazard identified by City staff, the LPC, and the Stakeholder Working Group. The MVP Community Resilience Building workshop participants also indicated it was a natural hazard of particular concern. Riverine flooding occurs when the rate of precipitation and/or amount of stormwater runoff overwhelms the capacity of natural or structured drainage systems causing overflows; urban flooding occurs when precipitation causes the water table to rise and leads to flooding of low-lying areas such as streets and underpasses. The City of Everett is bound by two major rivers – the Mystic River along the City’s southern perimeter and the Malden River along the City’s eastern perimeter. The Island End River is a tributary to the Mystic River and is located south of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) Amelia Earhart Dam. Flooding is generally caused by hurricanes, nor’easters, severe rainstorms, and thunderstorms. As noted in the SHMCAP, secondary hazards for flooding include landslides following flood events when high flows oversaturate soils on steep slopes, causing them to fail. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time as storms with increased precipitation rates become more frequent. 4.3.1.1 LOCATION Many of Everett’s urban flooding problems are associated with aging infrastructure and dense development patterns that involve significant areas of impervious surfaces which limit infiltration of precipitation and accelerate the velocity of stormwater runoff. Some areas within Everett that experience significant urban flooding issues include the Second Street corridor, which lacks stormwater infrastructure, Air Force Road, the Commercial Triangle section of Everett between Route 16 and the commuter rail tracks, and the area surrounding Glendale Park, which includes the site of the Everett Police Department. In addition to these areas, critical infrastructure that is vulnerable to flooding due to their location in the FEMA flood zone are indicated in Table 4-14 and shown on Map 4-1. For sites related to coastal flooding, see Section 4.4.1.1. Related underlying infrastructural deficiencies are noted, where available, and have been updated to reflect current conditions.

Problems in the drainage system and aging infrastructure continue to increase the probability of urban flooding. 4.3.2 LANDSLIDES According to the SHMCAP, “the term landslide includes a wide range of ground movement, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes, and shallow debris flows. Although gravity acting on an over steepened slope is the primary reason for a landslide, there are other contributing factors.” Among the contributing factors are erosion by rivers, glaciers, or ocean waves create over steepened slopes; rock and soil slopes weakened through saturation by snowmelt or heavy rains; earthquakes create stresses that make weak slopes fail; and excess weight from accumulation of rain or snow, and stockpiling of rock or ore, from waste piles, or from man-made structures. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time as storms with increased precipitation rates become more frequent. Landslides can result from human activities that destabilize an area or can occur as a secondary impact from another natural hazard such as flooding. In addition to structural damage to buildings and the blockage of transportation corridors, landslides can lead to sedimentation of water bodies. 4.3.2.1 LOCATION Landslides are a potential city-wide hazard in Everett. However, the City has limited vulnerability to landslides, and no critical facilities were identified with high vulnerability to landslides. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-11",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.3.2.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD The entire city is classified as having a moderate risk for landslides. See Map 4-2. 4.3.2.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS There have been no documented landslides in Everett. 4.3.2.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS The LPC did not believe that landslides pose a significant risk to Everett and did not take actions regarding this hazard in the 2008 or 2015 Plans. There have been no comments from the community regarding landslides. 4.3.3 DROUGHT As noted by the SHMCAP, “droughts can vary widely in duration, severity, and local impact. They may have widespread social and economic significance that requires the response of numerous parties, including water suppliers, firefighters, farmers, and residents. Droughts are often defined as periods of deficient precipitation. How this deficiency is experienced can depend on factors such as land use change, the existence of dams, and water supply withdrawals or diversions. For example, impervious surfaces associated with development can exacerbate the effects of drought due to decreased groundwater recharge.” Climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time as rising temperatures and precipitation patterns become more variable and extreme. 4.3.3.1 LOCATION In Everett, drought is a potential city-wide hazard. However, the impact of drought on Everett’s water supply is limited because the City receives its water supply from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), which operates two large reservoirs in central Massachusetts, Wachusett and Quabbin Reservoirs. Because of the very large ratio of storage to annual demand, the MWRA water system is very well buffered from the impacts of drought in terms of its ability to supply water to its service population. Even the multi-year drought of record from 1962 to 1965 did not seriously impair the MWRA water system. The City of Everett has not had to impose emergency water restrictions. Were there to be a severe drought worse than the drought of record, water use restrictions could be implemented, which would mainly have an impact on nonessential outdoor water use for irrigation of public parks and playing fields and residential lawns.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.3.3.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD Massachusetts generally receives enough precipitation under normal conditions to not be considered at a large risk for drought. DCR’s precipitation observation station closest to Everett, the East Boston station “BOSNWS,” recorded an average of 44.3 inches of annual precipitation between 1990-2014. This is significantly more than the national precipitation average of 30.9 inches during the same timeframe. 4.3.3.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS Everett does not collect data relative to drought events. Because drought is more of a regional natural hazard, this plan references state data as the best available data for drought. As noted in the SHMCAP, the Massachusetts has never received a Presidential Disaster Declaration for a drought-related disaster. However, Massachusetts has experienced extended periods of dry weather over the past 100 years and has recorded events dating back to 1879. 4.3.3.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS The Boston Harbor basin, which includes Everett, is expected to see a slight decrease to an increase in consecutive dry days throughout this century compared to the annual baseline of approximately 17 days per year from 1971 to 2001. Table 4-4, Projected Annual Consecutive Dry Days, indicates the projected number of consecutive dry days according to the “high” and “low” limits of the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (NE CASC) data.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.4 HAZARDS IMPACTED BY SEA LEVEL RISE 4.4.1 COASTAL FLOODING Coastal flooding is where wind and tide leads to flooding along tidal waterways such as the Island End River (IER) and the Lower Mystic River (south of the DCR Amelia Earhart Dam). The SHMCAP states coastal flooding is defined by the submersion of land along the ocean coast and other inland waters caused by the movement of seawater over and above normal present-day tide action. These types of flooding are often combined as storm events lead to large amounts of draining stormwater, which can be blocked by elements of the built environment and can be backed up when drainage locations (ponds, streams, etc.) are at or above capacity. Sea level rise driven by climate change will exacerbate these issues over time. 4.4.1.1 LOCATION The Island End River and a portion of the Mystic River south of the DCR Amelia Earhart Dam are tidally influenced and experience storm surge effects from Boston Harbor in major storm events. Relatively flat topographic elevations in Everett and neighboring Chelsea also present overland pathways for coastal/saltwater flooding to impact areas deeper into the community. Many of the City’s currently identified areas of flooding concern are directly linked to the filling of the Island End River in the early 1900s by the Eastern Gas and Coal Company, as well as subsequent filing for the construction of the New England Produce Center. The river was replaced by a ditch and culvert, which are partially located in adjoining Chelsea, and eventually drain into the Island End River in Chelsea near Williams Street. Several of the flooding areas of concern identified below are associated with the degraded Market Street culvert. The area of Everett that experiences the most significant coastal flooding issues is the New England Produce Center and surrounding properties along the Island End River. During three coastal storm events in 2018 identified in Chapter 1: Introduction, significant flooding inundated this area filling roadways and parking areas, submerging the commuter and freight rail tracks, and limiting vehicle access and commerce associated with produce distribution. Flood projections from the MC-FRM, which incorporates sea level rise, show increasing risk of severe damage in this area, as well as other areas along the Lower Mystic River from storm surge during coastal storm events. Additionally, piped infrastructure that flows into the Market and Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-14",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update Beacham Street culverts and ultimately discharges at an outfall into the Island End River can become surcharged with seawater when that outfall is submerged during coastal storm events. This condition creates multiple pathways back into Everett’s Industrial District and Commercial Triangle to spread the extent of coastal flood hazards. Locations such as Spring Street along the commuter rail tracks historically had tide gate infrastructure to limit this hazard. At this time, the majority of these upstream tide gates have fallen into disrepair due to age and lack of maintenance. In addition to these areas, the critical infrastructure vulnerable to flooding due to their location in both the FEMA flood zone are indicated in Table 4-14 and shown on Map 4-1.

Between 1921 and 2020, a relative sea level rise trend of 2.87 mm/year with a 95 percent confidence interval of +/- 0.15 mm/year (equivalent to 0.94 feet over a 100-year period) was observed in Boston.9 4.4.1.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS The frequency and severity of routine tidal flooding and storm-related flooding will increase due to the sea level rise effect of climate change. In addition, the frequency of severe storm events and resulting storm surge sufficient to cause coastal flooding is likely to increase due to climate change. However, as noted within the SHMCAP, communities like Everett can plan infrastructure improvements in preparation for elevated water levels using best available flood projection data for time horizons from present day out to the end of the century. 4.4.2 COASTAL HAZARDS Coastal hazards, including wave damage, storm surge, and erosion, remain a significant concern that is increasing due to climate change. Eroded coastlines have a lower capacity to buffer against the storm surge associated with hurricanes, nor’easters or other coastal storms, resulting in the greater vulnerability. Rising sea levels have led to increased rates of erosion along beaches and coastlines and the undermining of coastal bulkheads and estuarine river banks in Everett. Bulkheads and coastal banks in Everett protect the buildings from storm damage and their failure can lead to increased property damage. 4.4.2.1 LOCATION The City experiences erosion and undercutting along its Mystic River banks when the Amelia Earhart dam is opened by DCR to increase storm water storage capacity by lowering the level of the Upper Mystic River.

Coastal banks, salt marshes, and other elevated coastal landforms can buffer increased tidal levels and storm surges. 4.4.2.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS The City does not keep records of specific coastal erosion events, but the process is an incremental one over the long term. FEMA has indicated in their latest rules that post hazard event reconstruction or repair funding for coastal protection structures will only be made available where the damage can be directly attributed to the storm event. Therefore, to receive this funding, the City must maintain records of maintenance and repair activities that demonstrate the status of each structure. 4.4.2.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS The frequency of severe storm events and resulting storm surge sufficient to cause wave damage, storm surge, and erosion is likely to increase due to climate change. 4.5 HAZARDS IMPACTED BY RISING TEMPERATURES 4.5.1 HIGH HEAT There is no universal definition for extreme temperatures. The term is relative to the usual weather in the region based on climatic averages. High heat, for this climatic region, is usually defined as a period of 3 or more consecutive days above 90 °F, but more generally a prolonged period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high humidity. 4.5.1.1 LOCATION High heat is a city-wide hazard which has had an impact on Everett’s residents, especially on the more vulnerable populations such the elderly, school-aged children, and people with certain medical conditions, such as heart disease. However, even young and healthy individuals can succumb to heat if they participate in strenuous physical Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-17",

Some behaviors also put people at greater risk: drinking alcohol; taking part in strenuous outdoor physical activities in hot weather; and taking medications that impair the body's ability to regulate its temperature or that inhibit perspiration. The urban heat island effect is when cities experience much warmer temperatures than suburbs and rural communities on hot days. Dense development patterns, large areas of industrial land use, heavy commercial trucking activity, limited tree canopy cover, and a high percentage of impervious land cover all contribute to the urban heat island effect throughout Everett. The critical facilities vulnerable to flooding due to their location in areas mapped as historical experiencing urban heat island impacts such as localized higher ambient temperatures are indicated in Table 4-14 and shown on Map 4-3. 4.5.1.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD While a heat wave for Massachusetts is defined as three or more consecutive days above 90°F, another measure used for identifying extreme heat events is through a Heat Advisory from the NWS. These advisories are issued when the heat index (Figure 4-1) is forecast to exceed 100 degree Fahrenheit (F) for 2 or more hours; an excessive heat advisory is issued if forecast predicts the temperature to rise above105 degree F.

There are an average of four to five heat waves annually in Massachusetts. From 1979-2003, excessive heat exposure caused 8,015 deaths in the United States. During this period, more people in this country died from extreme heat than from hurricanes, lightning, tornados, floods, and earthquakes combined.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update The Trust for Public Land’s Climate Smart Cities report identifies several major corridors in Everett, as seen in Figure 4-2, as a “very high risk” of heat hazards and the remainder of the community as “moderate to high risk” of heat hazards. Figure 4-2: Everett Climate Smart Cities Map Source: Trust for Public Land, 2019 - https://www.tpl.org/how-we-work/climate-smart-cities 4.6 HAZARDS IMPACTED BY EXTREME WEATHER 4.6.1 SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS A thunderstorm is a storm originating in a cumulonimbus cloud. Cumulonimbus clouds produce lightning. Frequently during thunderstorm events, gusty winds, and heavy rain sufficient to produce flooding are present. Less frequently, hail is present, which can become very large in size. Tornadoes can also be generated during these events. The National Weather Service defines a severe thunderstorm as a thunderstorm that produces one-inch hail or larger in diameter and/or winds equal or exceed 58 mph. The city is vulnerable to both the wind and precipitation associated with thunderstorms. High winds can cause damage to structures, fallen trees, and downed power lines leading to power outages. Intense rainfall can overwhelm drainage systems causing localized flooding of rivers and streams as well as urban stormwater ponding and localized flooding. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-20",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update As severe thunderstorms are wind- and precipitation-related hazards, climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time as storms with increased severity and increased precipitation rates become more frequent. 4.6.1.1 LOCATION The effect and impact from severe thunderstorms are experienced across both the city and the entire state. 4.6.1.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD Thunderstorms can lead to localized damage and represent a hazard risk for communities. Severe thunderstorm can form quickly, and, on average, they are only around 15 miles in diameter and last for about 30 minutes. They are typically more difficult to predict than continental and coastal storms. 4.6.1.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS Eastern Massachusetts is at risk of one to two severe thunderstorms per year. Everett experienced three severe thunderstorm events from 2005 to April 30, 2014 with no deaths or injuries. Based on data from the NCEI Storm Events Database, 236 thunderstorm wind events occurred on 48 days in Middlesex County between April 1, 2014 and December 31, 2020. This includes six events on three days in Everett, causing an estimated $35,500 in property damage. During the same time period, the Storm Events Database reflects two hail events in Everett. These storms are detailed in Table 4-7.

The SHMCAP notes that “based on these available projections for future rainfall events, the probability of future thunderstorm events is anticipated to increase.” 4.6.2 SEVERE WINTER STORMS Severe winter storms include ice storms, nor’easters, heavy snow, blowing snow, and other extreme forms of winter precipitation. Winter storms are the most common and most familiar of the region’s hazards that affect large geographic areas. An increased amount of severe winter storms is expected due to climate change. Most blizzards and ice storms in the region cause more inconvenience than they do serious property damage, injuries, or deaths. However, periodically, a storm will occur which is a true disaster, and necessitates intense large-scale emergency response. Occasionally winter storms can also hinder the tidal exchange in tidally restricted watersheds and result in localized flooding within these areas. Ice build- up at gate structures can also damage tide gates and increase the hazard potential because of malfunctioning tide gates. Coastal storms also cause flooding because of tidal surges. Because a major feature of winter storms is the tendency for higher tides with associated flooding, the same mitigation measures in place for flooding are all important for mitigating the impacts of winter storms. However, the rapid melting Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-22",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update of snow after major storms, combined with rainfall, is more of a common flooding threat. The Everett Department of Public Works clears roads as requested by emergency service providers and carries on general snow removal operations, in conjunction with local snow removal contractors. The City continues to ban on-street parking at nights during snow storm events and during snow removal to ensure that streets can be plowed, and public safety vehicle access is maximized. The city’s overall vulnerability to winter storms is primarily related to restrictions to travel on roadways, temporary road closures, school closures, and potential restrictions on emergency vehicle access. A secondary vulnerability is power outages due to fallen trees and utility lines. 4.6.2.1 LOCATION The entire city is at risk for winter storms. The elderly population is particularly susceptible due to their increased risk of injury and death from falls, overexertion, or hypothermia related to clearing snow or power failures. Also vulnerable are low income residents who may lack access to housing or housing with sufficient insulation or heating supply. 4.6.2.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD The average annual snowfall for most of the city is 36.1 to 48.0 inches. There is a small band in the northwestern part of the city where the average snowfall is 48.1 to 72.0 inches. 4.6.2.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS The City of Everett does not keep local records of winter storms. Data for Middlesex County, which includes Everett, is the best available data to help understand previous occurrences and impacts of winter storm events. The NCEI Storm Events Database includes 39 heavy snow events in Middlesex County between April 1, 2014 and December 31, 2020, as shown in Table 4-8.

Nor’easters are the most frequently occurring natural hazard in the state, generally occurring on an annual basis with some years bringing up to four nor’easter events. Ice storms impact the Commonwealth on at least an annual basis. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-24",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.6.3 STRONG WINDS Strong winds, including those resulting from hurricanes and tornadoes, remain a significant concern for Everett. Effects from high winds can include downed trees and/or power lines and damage to roofs, windows, and other structural components. High winds can cause scattered power outages. High winds are also a hazard for the boating, shipping, and aviation industry sectors. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate these issues over time warmer temperatures create energy for more intense storms and increased precipitation rates become more frequent. A hurricane is a violent wind and rainstorm with wind speeds of 74-200 miles per hour. A hurricane is strongest as it travels over the ocean and is particularly destructive to coastal property as the storm hits the land. Hurricanes generally occur between June and November. There have been no significant changes to address hurricane emergency response since 2005. The two major mitigation measures in place are adherence to the Massachusetts State Building Code and the City’s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan which addresses hurricane hazards although primarily from a response perspective. A tornado is a violent windstorm characterized by a narrow, violently rotating column of air that extends from the base of a thunderstorm to the ground. They develop when cool air overrides a layer of warm air, causing the warm air to rise rapidly. Most vortices remain suspended in the atmosphere. Should they touch down, they become a force of destruction. There have been no changes since the 2008 Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan to address tornadoes in Everett beyond maintaining emergency shelters in the event that they were needed. The City has adopted the Massachusetts State Building Code. The code’s provisions are the most cost-effective mitigation measure against tornados given the extremely low probability of occurrence. The City does maintain American Red Cross certified emergency shelters if they were needed in case of evacuations due to tornadoes. 4.6.3.1 LOCATION Eastern Massachusetts, including Everett, has been impacted to varying degrees by numerous hurricanes throughout its history. Given their typical characteristics and size, they have the potential to impact the entire city of Everett. Given their unpredictable track, tornadoes are a potential city-wide hazard in Everett. Most structures pre-date current building codes and could be subject to significant damages. Evacuation may be required Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-25",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update on short notice. Sheltering and mass feeding efforts may be required along with debris clearance, search and rescue, and emergency fire and medical services. 4.6.3.2 EXTENT OF NATURAL HAZARD Hurricanes range from 50 to 500 miles across. Hurricane intensity is measured according to the Saffir-Simpson scale, which categorizes hurricane intensity linearly based upon maximum sustained winds, barometric pressure, and storm surge potential. These are combined to estimate potential damage. Table 4-9 gives an overview of the wind speeds and range of damage caused by different hurricane categories. Table 4-9: Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale Category Sustained Range of Damage Winds Speed (mph) 1 74-95 Very dangerous winds will produce some damage. 2 96-110 Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage. 3 111-129 Devastating damage will occur. 4 130-156 Catastrophic damage will occur. 5 157 or higher Catastrophic damage will occur. Source: NOAA National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center, https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php Tornado damage severity is measured by the Fujita Tornado Scale, in which wind speed is not measured directly but rather estimated from the amount of damage. As of February 01, 2007, the National Weather Service began rating tornados using the Enhanced Fujita-scale (EF- scale), shown in Table 4-9, which allows surveyors to create more precise assessments of tornado severity. Table 4-10: Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale EF 3-Second Gust Rating (mph) 0 65-85 1 86-110 2 111-135 3 136-165 4 166-200 5 Over 200 Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-26",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.6.3.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS Major storm events, such as hurricanes and tornados have been an occasional, albeit not frequent, threat to Everett. In 1944, a Category 1 hurricane tracked through northwestern Everett. A hurricane or storm track is the line that delineates the path of the eye of a hurricane or tropical storm. Typically, the entire city experiences the impacts of the wind and rain of hurricanes and tropical storms, regardless of the storm track. Tornadoes are rare in eastern Massachusetts. Although no tornadoes have been recorded within the City of Everett, a tornado rated as F2 struck the neighboring cities of Chelsea and Revere on July 28, 2014. 4.6.3.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS Storms with strong winds are projected to occur with increased frequency and intensity. Hurricanes and tropical storms are generally limited to the months of July, August, September, and October, with a few storms arriving in May, June, or November. As noted in the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s Fourth National Climate Assessment, tornado activity in the U.S. has become more variable, with a decrease in the number of days per year that tornadoes occur but an increase in the number of tornadoes on these days. 4.7 DAM FAILURE Considered a technological and human-caused hazard, dam failure can arise from two types of situations. Dams can fail because of structural problems independent of any storm event. Dam failure can follow an earthquake by causing structural damage. Dams can fail structurally because of flooding arising from a storm or they can overspill due to flooding. The DCR Amelia Earhart Dam separates the tidal and the non-tidal parts of the Mystic River. Constructed in 1966, is estimated to need $5 million dollars in repairs, including repairs to the third pump and the possible installation of a fourth pump. The dam is currently able to pump 4,000 cubic feet per second of flow from the Mystic and Malden Rivers against high tide into Boston Harbor. The pump improvements would increase the rate that flood water can travel out of the cities and towns along the Mystic River. 4.7.1 LOCATION The Amelia Earhart Dam is located on the Mystic River between the Cities of Everett and Somerville. It is owned and operated by the DCR, which also owns the Mystic Lakes Dam in Medford/Arlington, which is part of the Mystic Lakes system, located further upstream the Mystic River watershed. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-27",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.7.2 EXTENT OF HAZARD The dam provides an important tidal management resource on the Mystic River to control upstream flooding in the Mystic River watershed. In the event of a dam failure, the energy of the water stored behind even a small dam can cause loss of life and property damage if there are people or buildings downstream. The number of fatalities from a dam failure depends on the amount of warning provided to the population and the number of people in the area in the path of the dam’s floodwaters. In the case of the Amelia Earhart Dam, if a dam failure occurred, the lower elevation areas of Everett along the Mystic River could be impacted by flooding. In Everett, these areas do not include populated residential areas and are mostly industrial properties, some of which are abandoned or underutilized sites, but also include some currently active operations and many of which are currently storing hazardous materials such as petroleum products, fuels, and other chemicals. 4.7.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS There has never been a dam failure in Everett. 4.7.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS Dam failure in general is infrequent but has the potential for severe impacts. However, projected sea level rise and greater storm intensity increase the probability that floodwaters could flank and/or overtopping the dam in its current condition. 4.8 EARTHQUAKE An earthquake, a non-climate influenced hazard, is the vibration of the Earth’s surface that follows a release of energy in the Earth’s crust. These earthquakes often occur along fault boundaries. As a result, areas that lie along fault boundaries—such as California, Alaska, and Japan—experience earthquakes more often than areas located within the interior portions of these plates. New England, on the other hand, experiences intraplate earthquakes because it is located deep within the interior of the North American plate. 4.8.1 LOCATION Earthquakes are a potential city-wide hazard in Everett. The City has many un- reinforced, older masonry buildings which would be vulnerable in a severe earthquake. 4.8.2 EXTENT OF HAZARD Seismologists use the Richter Scale to express the amount of seismic energy released by an earthquake (shown in Table 4-11), while the intensity of an Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-28",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update earthquake is measured by the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale (shown in Figure 4-3). As the Richter Scale has a logarithmic basis, each whole number step corresponds to the release of about 31 times more energy than the preceding whole number. Table 4-11: Richter Scale Magnitude Earthquake Effects Less than 3.5 Usually not felt, but can be recorded by seismograph. 3.5-5.4 Often felt, but only causes minor damage. 5.5-6.0 Slight damage to buildings and other structures. 6.1-6.9 May cause a lot of damage in very populated areas. 7.0-7.9 Major earthquake. Serious damage. 8 or greater Great earthquake. Can totally destroy communities near the epicenter. Figure 4-3: Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale 4.8.3 PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HAZARD EVENTS There have been no recorded earthquake epicenters within the City of Everett although residents may feel the tremors from one or more of the infrequent earthquakes recorded within the region. 4.8.4 PROBABILITY OF FUTURE EVENTS Earthquakes cannot be predicted and may occur at any time. As stated in the SHMCAP, “because of the low frequency of earthquake occurrence and the Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-29",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update relatively low levels of ground shaking that are usually experienced, the entire Commonwealth can be expected to have a low to moderate risk to earthquake damage as compared to other areas of the country.” 4.9 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT TRENDS 4.9.1 EXISTING LAND USE As previously noted, Everett has both densely developed residential neighborhoods, as well as an intensely used industrial area that includes a marine terminal associated with liquified natural gas (LNG), fuel storage facilities, and a materials processing facility. The residential neighborhood and commercial areas are in the upland hills while the industrial area is adjacent to the Mystic River and Island End River. Everett is a densely populated city with over 13,000 people per square mile and is also an Environmental Justice community. Except for the waterfront areas, there is little natural open space, with acres of cemeteries located in the northeast section of the city and smaller parks located throughout the city. The city’s land use is shown on Map 4-4. The most recent land use statistics available from the state are from aerial photography taken in 2016. Table 4-12 shows the acreage and percentage of land in 13 categories. If the residential categories are aggregated, residential uses make up 32.8% (722.6 acres) of the city’s area. The most prevalent use is multi- family residential with 21.3% (469.5 acres) of the city’s use.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update 4.11 VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT The purpose of the vulnerability assessment is to estimate the extent of potential damages from natural hazards of varying types and intensities. A vulnerability assessment and estimation of damages was performed for earthquakes and flooding using HAZUS software. 4.11.1 INTRODUCTION TO HAZUS-MH HAZUS- MH (multiple-hazards) is a computer program developed by FEMA to estimate losses due to a variety of natural hazards. The following overview of HAZUS-MH is taken from the FEMA website. For more information on the HAZUS-MH software, go to https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/products-tools/hazus. “Hazus is a nationally standardized risk modeling methodology. It is distributed as free GIS-based desktop software with a collection of inventory databases for every U.S. state and territory. Hazus identifies areas with high risk for natural hazards and estimates physical, economic, and social impacts of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tsunamis. The Hazus Program, managed by FEMA’s Natural Hazards Risk Assessment Program, partners with other federal agencies, research institutions, and regional planning authorities to ensure Hazus resources incorporate the latest scientific and technological approaches and meet the needs of the emergency management community. Hazus is used for mitigation, recovery, preparedness, and response. Mitigation planners, GIS specialists, and emergency managers use Hazus to determine potential losses from disasters and to identify the most effective mitigation actions for minimizing those losses. Hazus supports the risk assessment requirement in the mitigation planning process. Response planners use Hazus to map potential impacts from catastrophic events and identify effective strategies for response and preparedness. Hazus is also used during real-time response efforts to estimate impacts from incoming storms or ongoing earthquake sequences. Hazus can quantify and map risk information such as: • Physical damage to residential and commercial buildings, schools, critical facilities and infrastructure. • Economic loss, including lost jobs, business interruptions, and repair and reconstruction costs. • Social impacts, including estimates of displaced households, shelter requirements, and populations exposed to floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis. • Cost-effectiveness of common mitigation strategies, such as elevating structures in a floodplain or retrofitting unreinforced masonry buildings.” Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-46",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update There are three modules included with the HAZUS-MH software: hurricane wind, flooding, and earthquakes. There are also three levels at which HAZUS-MH can be run. Level 1 uses national baseline data and is the quickest way to begin the risk assessment process. The analysis that follows was completed using Level 1 data. Level 1 relies upon default data on building types, utilities, transportation, etc. from national databases as well as census data. While the databases include a wealth of information on the City of Everett, it does not capture all relevant information. In fact, the HAZUS training manual notes that the default data is “subject to a great deal of uncertainty.” However, for the purposes of this plan, the analysis is useful. This plan is attempting to only generally indicate the possible extent of damages due to certain types of natural disasters and to allow for a comparison between different types of disasters. Therefore, this analysis should be considered to be a starting point for understanding potential damages from the hazards. If interested, communities can build a more accurate database and further test disaster scenarios. It is expected that the City of Everett will advance this analysis as part of an upcoming Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) to support flood resilience projects at the Island End River. 4.11.2 ESTIMATED DAMAGES FROM EARTHQUAKES The HAZUS earthquake module allows users to define an earthquake magnitude and model the potential damages caused by that earthquake as if its epicenter had been at the geographic center of the study area. For the purposes of this plan, an earthquake with a magnitude 5.3 was selected. Historically, major earthquakes are rare in New England, though a magnitude 5.3 event occurred in 1963. In summary, an earthquake of this magnitude would likely cause nearly $1 billion dollars in damages, including damage to regional transportation infrastructure, municipal utility infrastructure, and community-wide facility damages. The full results of the analysis for Everett are summarized in Appendix C: Risk Assessment Materials. 4.11.3 ESTIMATED DAMAGES FROM FLOODING While HAZUS outputs related to flooding are included in Appendix C: Risk Assessment Materials, the LPC decided ultimately not to limit estimated flood damages from HAZUS based upon the limited extent of the current FEMA 100- year floodplain while the latest Middlesex County flood maps are published (formerly anticipated in 2020). This flood map update will significantly extend the mapped floodplain in Everett to match the 2016 Suffolk County update that triggered significant expansion of the regulated floodplain in the City of Chelsea. Current flood mapping highlights the significant divided in the level of flood map accuracy at the Island End River where the portion of the New England Produce Center within Chelsea is mapped and the portion in Everett is not mapped despite Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-47",

Approximately 18.9% of the City’s land area, and approximately 62 buildings worth an estimated $429,952,200 were identified by the LPC as areas were where flooding most frequently occurs based upon the anticipated 2020 mapped FEMA 100-year floodplain. Based upon FEMA guidance, the estimated losses in this area would range from 10% ($42,995,220) and 50% ($214,976,100) of total building value. Approximately 62.6% of the City’s land area, and approximately 1,067 buildings worth an estimated $972,165,000 were identified by the LPC as areas where flooding is projected to frequently occur in 2070 time-horizon based the Massachusetts Coastal – Flood Risk Model. Based upon FEMA guidance, the estimated losses in this area would range from 10% ($97,165,000) and 50% ($486,082,500) of total building value. These estimated damages are limited to coastal flood impacts do not include inland urban flooding, which has not been accurately modeled in Everett to date. The City of Everett is currently engaging in stormwater modeling efforts for areas of the city that report inland flooding hazards and will update the Plan accordingly with estimate damages and associated mitigation measures as more information is available. 4.11.4 NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP) INSURED STRUCTURES The Massachusetts NFIP Coordinator provided information regarding repetitive loss properties in Everett. A repetitive loss property is a property for which two or more NFIP losses of at least $1,000 each have been paid within any 10-year rolling period since 1978. As of July 2, 2020, there were three repetitive loss properties in Everett. All three were residential properties, with two located in a Zone A flood hazard zone. There has been a total of 11 paid losses, with total losses of $66,457, which is an increase of $5,754 since the 2015 HMP Plan. Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 4-48",

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 5: CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT 5.1 INTRODUCTION The Capability Assessment identifies the strengths and weaknesses of Everett’s policies, programs, partnerships, and funding opportunities to mitigate the risks of natural hazards. It evaluates both current and future opportunities to improve capabilities as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): 1. Planning and regulatory capabilities based on the implementation of ordinances, policies, local laws and State statues, and plans and programs that relate to guiding and managing growth and development. 2. Administrative and technical capabilities associated with the City’s staff and their skills and their tools that can be used for mitigation planning and to implement specific mitigation actions. 3. Financial capabilities that include the resources the City has access to or is eligible to use to fund mitigation actions. 4. Education and outreach capabilities resulting from programs and methods already in place that could be used to implement mitigation activities and communicate hazard-related information. 5.2 PLANNING AND REGULATORY CAPABILITIES Planning and regulatory capabilities include the local plans, codes, ordinances, policies, and programs that mitigate the impact of natural hazards. With input from the Local Planning Committee (LPC) and Stakeholder Working Group, the following table provides an inventory of the available resources that impact Everett’s ability to mitigate risk. The relative effectiveness of each resources is ranked on a scale from “Most Effective” through “Somewhat Effective” to “Least Effective” in its potential ability to address potential hazards in Everett based upon its current form/structure/use. Additional notes on each resource, including ways to supplement or enhance the effectiveness of the resource, are included in Table 5-1, Planning and Regulatory Capabilities.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 6: MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES 6.1 INTRODUCTION Hazard mitigation refers to “any sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate the long- term risk to human life and property from hazardous conditions.” The mitigation goals and strategies set by the City of Everett through its 2015 Hazard Mitigation Plan are presented in this chapter along with updated goals and strategies to address current hazards and the projected impacts of climate change. Everett’s mitigation goals and strategies were updated based upon the results of the hazard identification and risk assessment presented in Chapter 4: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment. 6.2 EXISTING MITIGATION GOALS The purpose of the Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update (the “2021 HMP Update” or “Plan”) is to provide the City of Everett with an assessment of the natural hazards it has experienced in the 2015-2021 period, as well as strategies to reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property damage resulting from likely future hazards, including those hazards exasperated by the impacts of climate change. With a robust community engagement process and a comprehensive inventory of Everett’s existing mitigation tools, the 2021 HMP Update suggests improvements to the City’s planning, policy, and programs to reduce vulnerability and risk. In the 2015 HMP Update Plan, the City of Everett identified the following nine mitigation goals for the community: 1. Prevent and reduce the loss of life, injury, and property damages resulting for all major natural hazards. 2. Identify and seek funding for measures to mitigate or eliminate each known significant flood hazard area. 3. Integrate hazard mitigation planning as an integral factor in all relevant municipal departments, committees, and boards. • Ensure that the Planning Department considers hazard mitigation in its review and permitting of new development. • Review zoning regulations to ensure that ordinance incorporates all reasonable hazard mitigation provisions. • Ensure that all relevant municipal departments have the resources to continue to enforce codes and regulations related to hazard mitigation. 4. Prevent and reduce the damage to public infrastructure resulting from all hazards Chapter 6: Mitigation Goals & Strategies 6-1",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update • Begin to assess the vulnerability of municipal buildings and infrastructure to damage from an earthquake. • Maintain existing mitigation infrastructure in good condition. 5. Encourage the business community, major institutions, and non-profits to work with the City to develop, review, and implement the hazard mitigation plan. 6. Work with surrounding communities, state, regional, and federal agencies to ensure regional cooperation and solutions for hazards affecting multiple communities. • Continue to participate in the Mystic Region Regional Emergency Planning Committee (REPC). 7. Ensure that future development meets federal, state, and local standards for preventing and reducing the impacts of natural hazards. 8. Educate the public about natural hazards and mitigation measures that can be undertaken by property owners. • Provide information on hazard mitigation activities in languages most frequently spoken in Everett. 9. Take maximum advantage of resources from FEMA and MEMA to educate City staff and the public about hazard mitigation. 6.3 UPDATED MITIGATION GOALS Through discussions with the Local Planning Committee (LPC), the majority of the 2015 HMP Update goals were reconfirmed as ongoing goals of the community. Minor modifications were suggested to adapt specific text to current conditions as follows: 1. Prevent and reduce the loss of life, injury, and property damages resulting for all major natural hazards. 2. Identify and seek funding for measures to mitigate or eliminate each known significant flood hazard area. 3. Integrate hazard mitigation planning as an integral factor in all relevant municipal departments, committees, and boards. • Review zoning regulations to ensure that ordinance incorporates all reasonable hazard mitigation provisions. • Ensure that all relevant municipal departments have the resources to continue to enforce codes and regulations related to hazard mitigation. 4. Prevent and reduce the damage to public infrastructure resulting from all hazards, incorporating a particular focus on flooding and extreme heat hazards, which are likely to intensify due to climate change. 5. Encourage the business community, major institutions, and non-profits to work with the City to develop, review, and implement the hazard mitigation plan.

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update The City of Everett takes a holistic approach to addressing hazard mitigation. By working across communities, City departments, and demographics, the City has begun a comprehensive effort to mitigate risk from urban and coastal flooding, high heat, severe storm events, and more. Specifically, to address the current consistent threat of flooding near the Island End River (IER), the City Everett and its regional partner, the City of Chelsea, has both independently and collaboratively pursued planning and infrastructure projects to improve the resilience of the IER area. Several projects in the Industrial District/Designated Port Area are already underway, including: • DPA Industrial District Master Planning - The Everett Industrial District/ Designated Port Area is used primarily for wholesale produce, a deep-water petroleum and liquid natural gas port, and heavy construction and material recycling businesses. This master plan study will involve developing an understanding of current businesses and operations, uncovering new economic development strategies, and crafting a comprehensive implementation plan. • Market Street Culvert Tide Gate at IER Outfall- Two corrugated metal culverts, one on Market Street and one on Beacham Street, were installed decades ago when the IER was filled in. As these culverts fail, the river is “self-daylighting”—breaking through the surface of the NEPC parking lots in unpredictable and dangerous ways. The culvert backs up with seawater and floods inland neighborhoods of Everett and Chelsea during storm events and astronomical high tides. The City of Everett is pursuing funding for a new tide gate to prevent this saltwater flooding into urban neighborhoods. This part of the project is essential for the rest of the coastal flood management strategy to work; otherwise water will pour in behind flood barriers via the stormwater system. • Market Street Culvert Improvements - Constructed in 1965, Market Street culvert carries the old IER from an open drainage channel north of the Boston Market Terminal, across the site, and under Market Street to an outfall at the IER in Chelsea. Flooding has been a problem in the area for many years due to this culvert deteriorating and several sections of it collapsing. The Cities of Everett and Chelsea are partnering with a private landowner to replace the existing corrugated metal arch with a reinforced box culvert, and daylight a 400 linear-foot section of the river. The Market Street culvert repairs will improve its ability to manage intense precipitation events. The daylighted, landscaped portion of the channel will provide social benefits, including reducing summer heat and providing much-needed public open space. • MBTA Culvert Repairs - The MBTA stormwater culvert northeast of Boston Market Terminal at 34 Market Street site was repaired in 2020 as part of activities in the City of Everett's proposed 20-Year Capital Improvement Recommended Plan. In 2021, the City of Everett will continue discussions with the MBTA about the Chapter 6: Mitigation Goals & Strategies 6-6",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update installation of additional relief drains underneath the MBTA tracks in the Spring Street area and removal of broken tide gate structures that cause stormwater to back up and increase surface flooding. 6.5 UPDATED MITIGATION STRATEGIES The LPC and Stakeholder Working Group participants reviewed recent mitigation prioritizes identified in the Community Resilience Building Summary of Findings report prepared as part of the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) program in 2019. The LPC further refined the list of mitigation strategies to include • The Title of Mitigation Measure and Hazard addressed by the mitigation measure; • A Description of the mitigation measure; • Implementation Responsibility; • Potential Partners; • Time Frame for implementation of mitigation measure; • Estimated Cost of implementing mitigation measure categorized as follows: Very high (over $10 million) o High ($1 million - $10 million) o Medium ($100,000 - $1 million) o Low ($50,000 - $100,000) o Very low (under $50,000) o • Potential Funding Source or Supporting Agency (through Technical Assistance) These designations reflect discussion and a consensus developed by the LPC with input from stakeholders but could change as conditions in the community change over time. The impact of climate change is likely to intensify natural hazards and may lead to a change in prioritization of the next five years. The LPC will continue to review and maintain this list of prioritized mitigation measures to adjust to changing conditions in Everett. The information on potential funding sources shown in Table 6-2; Updated Mitigation Strategies, is preliminary and dependent on available funding per fiscal year. Many mitigation strategies will require multiple funding sources and identification of a potential funding source in Table 6-2 does not guarantee that a project will be eligible for or selected for funding. Upon adoption of this plan, the LPC is responsible for implementation should begin to explore the funding sources in more detail. Chapter 6: Mitigation Goals & Strategies 6-7",

        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update CHAPTER 7: PLAN ADOPTION & MAINTENANCE 7.1 PLAN ADOPTION The Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan was adopted by the City Council on Month Date, Year. See Certificate of Adoption at the start of the Plan for documentation. The Plan was approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Month Date, Year for a period of five years. The Plan is set to expire on Month Date, Year. 7.2 PLAN MAINTENANCE While many of the mitigation measures from the City's previous Hazard Mitigation Plan have been implemented since that plan was adopted there has not been an ongoing local process to guide implementation of the plan. Additionally, there were no members of the previous Local Planning Committee (LPC) still serving in their roles in Everett at the time of this plan update. Over the next five years, it will be key to have an established process for the implementation of this plan update. Fort Point Associates (a Tetra Tech Company) worked with the Everett LPC and Stakeholder Working Group to prepare this plan. After approval of the plan by FEMA, the City of Everett will combine this plan implementation with an existing Core Team established for the Massachusetts EEA MVP program, with the Conservation Agent designated as the coordinator. The Core Team meets at minimum quarterly to fulfill other grant program obligations that overlap the areas of interest in the hazard mitigation plan, including climate resilience, municipal preparedness, and public education centered around natural and climate-enhanced hazards. Core Team members will continue to participate in regional and state-based meetings/trainings to stay current with best practices for mitigating risk. These meetings/trainings may include those with the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), the Regional Emergency Planning Committee, Resilient Mystic Collaborative, and others. Additional members could be added to the Core Team from businesses, non-profit organizations, and other entities. The City will continue encourage public participation throughout the five-year implementation of this plan and in the review and update process. As updates and a review of the plan are conducted by the Core Team, these will be placed on the City’s web site ,, a hard copy of the Plan and all updates will be available for viewing at Everett City Hall, and the Plan and all updates will be promoted on the City’s social media accounts. Any public meetings associated with this work will be publicly noticed in accordance with local and state open meeting laws. The City of Everett agrees to update and adopt this mitigation plan on a five-year basis. This update will include a comprehensive review and planning process like the one used Chapter 7: Plan Adoption and Maintenance 7-1",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update to develop the Plan. This process includes updating land use practices, collecting, and reviewing best available data, reviewing the capability assessment, engaging the public and relevant stakeholders, and updating the mitigation strategies. This process will occur according to the latest FEMA guidelines. The City of Everett will establish funding for the development of the plan update a year before the Plan expires in 2026. The Conservation Agent will serve as the Project Manager for the update process. 7.3 IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION SCHEDULE Plan Implementation Survey – The Conservation Agent will prepare and distribute a survey in year three of the Plan. The plan implementation survey will be distributed to all LPC members and other interested local stakeholders. The survey will poll the members on any changes or revisions to the plan that may be needed, progress and accomplishments for implementation, and any new hazards or risks as identified in the City of Everett. This information will be used to prepare a report or addendum to the local hazard mitigation plan to evaluate its effectiveness in meeting the plan’s goals and objectives and to identify areas that need to be updated in the next plan. The Core Team, led by the Conservation Agent, will have primary responsibility for tracking progress, evaluating, and updating the plan. Prepare for the next Plan Update – FEMA’s approval of this plan is valid for five years, by which time an updated plan must be approved by FEMA to maintain the town’s approved plan status and its eligibility for FEMA hazard mitigation grants. Given the lead time needed to secure funding and conduct the planning process, the Core Team will begin to prepare for an update of the plan in year three. This will help the City avoid any lapse in its approved plan status and grant eligibility when the current Plan expires in 2026. Prepare and Adopt an Updated Local Hazard Mitigation Plan – Once the resources have been secured to update the plan, the Core Team will hire a consultant team to lead the plan update. The Core Team will review the latest FEMA hazard mitigation plan guidelines for guidance in updating the mitigation plan. The Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update will be forwarded to MEMA for review and to FEMA for approval. 7.4 INTEGRATION OF PLAN WITH OTHER PLANNING EFFORTS Upon approval of the Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update by FEMA, the Core Team will provide all interested parties and implementing departments with a copy of the Plan and will initiate a discussion regarding how the plan can be integrated into each department’s ongoing efforts. Chapter 7: Plan Adoption and Maintenance 7-2",
        "City of Everett Hazard Mitigation Plan 2021 Update At a minimum, the plan will be reviewed and discussed with the following departments: • Fire • Police • Public Works • Planning • Health • Building • Recreation Other groups that will be coordinated with include representatives of local businesses, the Everett Chamber of Commerce, nonprofit organizations, and other stakeholders. The Plan will also be posted on the City’s website and promoted on the City’s social media accounts. The posting of the plan on the City website will include a mechanism for citizen feedback such as an e-mail address to send comments to the attention of the Conservation Agent. The Hazard Mitigation Plan will be integrated into other city plans and policies as they are updated and renewed, including the Everett Open Space and Recreation Plan, the latest Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP), upcoming housing plans, and other initiatives.

        "Overview of 2021 HMP Update Agenda Risks and Hazards Next Steps",
        "Why We’re Here: FEMA HMP Requirements • The 2000 Federal Disaster Mitigation Act requires communities that wish to qualify for FEMA funding adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan. • Plans must be updated in five-year intervals and involve a robust community engagement process. • Hazard mitigation includes “any sustainable action that reduces or eliminates long-term risk to people and property from future disasters.” AUGUST 27, 2020 | 3",
        "Everett HMP History • Everett first participated in hazard mitigation planning in 2004, when it and eight other Metro Boston communities filed the Metro Boston Multi Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan under the guidance of MAPC. • The City’s first individual HMP was prepared by MAPC and filed in 2015. It was approved by FEMA in October 2016. • Building on public participation and stakeholder engagement, the 2015 HMP Update identified nine mitigation goals to reduce the dangers to life and property from the following community-identified natural hazard events: VERY HIGH FREQUENCY MEDIUM FREQUENCY LOW FREQUENCY VERY LOW FREQUENCY Flooding Hurricanes Landslides Dam Failures Coastal Hazards Brush Fires Drought Earthquakes Severe Thunderstorms Tornadoes Nor’easters Extreme Temperatures Winter Storms",

        "Community Context Population Density • Population corresponds with land use; primarily residential north of Revere Beach Parkway and Northern Strand Community Trail • Least dense in heavily industrial/commercial areas along Mystic, Malden, and Island End Rivers • Most dense toward center of city and Broadway “spine” AUGUST 27, 2020 | 7",
        "Flooding • Everett is subject to inland (riverine) flooding, urban (precipitation) flooding, and coastal (storm surge) flooding. • Floods are caused by severe rainstorms, thunderstorms, nor’easters, and hurricanes. • Undersized or lack of storm drainage and large expanses of impervious surfaces (building roofs, asphalt pavement for roadways or parking areas, etc.) exacerbate flooding impacts.",
        "Current FEMA Flood Zones (2010) • Middlesex county Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) last updated in June 2010 • Suffolk County FIRM maps updated in 2016 • Areas of potentially high flood risk (such as the Island End River near the New England Produce Center) are currently mapped as hazards in Chelsea but are not mapped over the county line in Everett AUGUST 27D, 2E0C2E0M|B 9ER 10, 2020 | 9",
        "Community Risk Profile • “Repetitive Loss” (RL) is defined by FEMA as: a National Flood Insurance Program-insured structure that has had at least 2 paid flood losses of more than $1,000 each in any 10-year period since 1978. • In Everett, there have been 2 RL Buildings in the A and AE Zones, and 1 building in the X Zone. • Losses total $23,876.25. • The quantity and value of these claims reflect the flood zones on the FIRMs to date, which cover only small portions of the Island End River area, the Malden River area, and the Mystic River DPA.",

        "General Description of the Region Hazus-MH is a regional earthquake loss estimation model that was developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Institute of Building Sciences. The primary purpose of Hazus is to provide a methodology and software application to develop multi-hazard losses at a regional scale. These loss estimates would be used primarily by local, state and regional officials to plan and stimulate efforts to reduce risks from multi-hazards and to prepare for emergency response and recovery. The earthquake loss estimates provided in this report was based on a region that includes 1 county(ies) from the following state(s): Massachusetts Note: Appendix A contains a complete listing of the counties contained in the region. The geographical size of the region is 3.54 square miles and contains 8 census tracts. There are over 15 thousand households in the region which has a total population of 41,667 people (2010 Census Bureau data). The distribution of population by Total Region and County is provided in Appendix B. There are an estimated 9 thousand buildings in the region with a total building replacement value (excluding contents) of 4,405 (millions of dollars). Approximately 89.00 % of the buildings (and 71.00% of the building value) are associated with residential housing.
