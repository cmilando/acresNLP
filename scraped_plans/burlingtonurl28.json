We are currently researching resilience strategies planned or implemented at the local and regional level across the country that could potentially help coastal communities in New Jersey adapt to sea level rise and other challenges faced by climate change. Our work, being performed in conjunction with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, is intended to help create the framework for a coastal resilience plan New Jersey intends to develop over the next two years. Please let me know when you have some time within the next two weeks to discuss your experiences with the _______________ project. I’ll also follow up with a phone call this week with the hope of arranging a time and date certain for a call. Below is a list of the questions I’d like to ask about your project. Questions 1. Has the strategy achieved the desired goals? 2. How long did it take and was it costly? 3. How is/was the strategy implemented, what authority enabled you to implement it? 4. Whose buy-in was needed to implement the strategy and how did you achieve it? 5. Who has chief responsibility to implement the strategy? I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance for your help.PROPOSED MLUL Modification to Incorporate Resiliency Planning 40:55D-3 Definitions Natural hazard refers to all atmospheric, hydrologic (e.g. extreme storms, heavy precipitation), geologic (especially seismic and volcanic), and wildfire phenomena that, because of their location, severity, and frequency, have the potential to affect humans, their structures, and/or their activities adversely including but not limited to: drought; sea-level rise; extreme temperatures; flooding, and air quality impacts associated with temperature changes. Resilience: The ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions; and to withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions Article 3. Master Plan 40:55D-28 Preparation; contents; modification. b. The master plan shall generally comprise a report or statement and land use and development proposals, with maps, diagrams and text, presenting, at least the following elements (1) and (2) and, where appropriate, the following elements (3) through (17): 17) A resiliency plan element that: a) analyzes current and future potential of community risks and vulnerability associated with natural hazards; (b) identifies critical facilities, utilities and roadways necessary for evacuation purposes and sustaining quality of life during a disaster that must be protected and maintained in an operational state; (c) analyzes the impact of community risk and vulnerability on each component and element of the master plan; (d) describes strategies and design standards that may be implemented to reduce and/or avoid risks associated with natural hazards; (e) includes specific policy statements on the consistency, coordination, and integration of the resiliency plan element to the existing or proposed county Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan, floodplain management plan, comprehensive emergency management plan, emergency response plan, post-disaster recovery plan, and the capital improvement plan. e. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection shall provide all municipalities with the most recent natural hazards projections based on the best available science. This data shall be used by municipalities when preparing or updating their master plans.",

        "Hello, We at New Jersey Future consider the coastal resilience work you are doing to be highly innovative and would very much like the opportunity to talk with you about your _______________project. We are currently researching resilience strategies planned or implemented at the local and regional level across the country that could potentially help coastal communities in New Jersey adapt to sea level rise and other challenges faced by climate change. Our work, being performed in conjunction with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, is intended to help create the framework for a coastal resilience plan New Jersey intends to develop over the next two years. Please let me know when you have some time within the next two weeks to discuss your experiences with the _______________ project. I’ll also follow up with a phone call this week with the hope of arranging a time and date certain for a call. Below is a list of the questions I’d like to ask about your project. Questions 1. Has the strategy achieved the desired goals? 2. How long did it take and was it costly? 3. How is/was the strategy implemented, what authority enabled you to implement it? 4. Whose buy-in was needed to implement the strategy and how did you achieve it? 5. Who has chief responsibility to implement the strategy? I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance for your help.",

        "PROPOSED MLUL Modification to Incorporate Resiliency Planning 40:55D-3 Definitions Natural hazard refers to all atmospheric, hydrologic (e.g. extreme storms, heavy precipitation), geologic (especially seismic and volcanic), and wildfire phenomena that, because of their location, severity, and frequency, have the potential to affect humans, their structures, and/or their activities adversely including but not limited to: drought; sea-level rise; extreme temperatures; flooding, and air quality impacts associated with temperature changes. Resilience: The ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions; and to withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions Article 3. Master Plan 40:55D-28 Preparation; contents; modification. b. The master plan shall generally comprise a report or statement and land use and development proposals, with maps, diagrams and text, presenting, at least the following elements (1) and (2) and, where appropriate, the following elements (3) through (17): 17) A resiliency plan element that: a) analyzes current and future potential of community risks and vulnerability associated with natural hazards; (b) identifies critical facilities, utilities and roadways necessary for evacuation purposes and sustaining quality of life during a disaster that must be protected and maintained in an operational state; (c) analyzes the impact of community risk and vulnerability on each component and element of the master plan; (d) describes strategies and design standards that may be implemented to reduce and/or avoid risks associated with natural hazards; (e) includes specific policy statements on the consistency, coordination, and integration of the resiliency plan element to the existing or proposed county Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan, floodplain management plan, comprehensive emergency management plan, emergency response plan, post-disaster recovery plan, and the capital improvement plan. e. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection shall provide all municipalities with the most recent natural hazards projections based on the best available science. This data shall be used by municipalities when preparing or updating their master plans."
