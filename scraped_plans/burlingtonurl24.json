As primary implementers of the IRA, states and territories are essential to delivering on its promise and took important steps this year to harness its historic investments to build healthier communities and tackle the climate crisis. Alliance governors also used their collective voice to raise the floor of federal ambition. The coalition kicked off the year by calling on the Biden administration to advance a series of additional federal climate actions that will support states and accelerate the nation’s transition to a net-zero future. In a letter to President Biden, the Alliance laid out more than 20 specific actions the federal government can take to cut emissions across sectors, and throughout the year, continued to partner closely with the administration to support effective deployment of federal executive authority on climate. The Alliance’s engagement included providing detailed recommendations on the development of Photo Credit: U.S. Climate Alliance federal programs, policies, and regulations; establishing innovative new partnerships; and facilitating state-federal convenings to collaborate on, scale up, and inform Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond ambitious climate solutions across government. As unprecedented wildfire smoke, record heat, and catastrophic flooding swept across the country this year, Alliance governors were reminded of the crisis facing their states and territories and the urgency of their work. More action is needed across all sectors of the economy to make the coalition’s long-term collective climate goals a reality and to ensure that all communities are more resilient to future extreme weather events expected under current warming conditions. Doing so will deliver even more health and economic benefits above and beyond what Alliance members have already achieved.

While this bump in GHG emissions was expected, it demonstrates clearly how important it is for Alliance members — and the nation — to accelerate development and implementation of bold climate policies and programs that will result in lasting reductions. FIGURE 1. The Alliance’s collective net GHG emissions decreased an estimated 18 percent between 2005 and 2021.

Transportation remains the largest source of collective GHG emissions, followed by power and industry. • Transportation remained the largest source of the Alliance’s collective GHG emissions by far, representing nearly one-third of total emissions (Figure 3). The transportation sector also saw the largest rebound in emissions following the height of the pandemic — a 13 percent increase between 2020 and 2021 — as demand for travel resumed. This data suggests additional action is needed to increase the use of more efficient and zero-emission vehicles, low-carbon fuels, and multimodal options. • More than 45 percent of electricity generated across the Alliance comes from carbon-free sources, compared to only one-third in the rest of the United States.12 Between 2020 and 2021, GHG emissions from electricity generation grew by 6 percent in Alliance states and territories. 32% Transport This was largely driven by a 19 percent increase in 20% Power coal-fired generation, in line with national trends.

To assess the largest opportunities for Alliance members to work together and with the federal government to build on this progress and achieve collective long-term climate goals, the Alliance commissioned Energy and Environmental Economics (E3) to update its last analysis conducted for the coalition’s 2021 Annual Report. This updated analysis incorporates major advances in state and federal climate legislation and regulations over the past two years and assesses where the Alliance’s collective GHG emissions are headed through 2050 under four scenarios (specific assumptions can be found in Appendix 1). Key Takeaways E3’s analysis shows that the Alliance has made real Alliance members to meet their collective goals of progress toward achieving its 2025 GHG emissions reducing net GHG emissions at least 50-52 percent by reduction target, thanks to ambitious state policies and 2030 and achieving overall net-zero GHG emissions historic federal investments and programs enacted over by 2050, both below 2005 levels.

The largest driver of additional emissions reductions in the near-term is the achievement of aviation decarbonization targets, highlighting this sector as a prime opportunity for strong federal action — and one that states are unlikely to be able to address alone, in light of federal preemption issues. While EPA’s proposed vehicle emissions standards help increase ZEV adoption, benefits are consolidated in Alliance jurisdictions that have not yet adopted the ACC II and Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) regulations. The impact of proposed power plant regulations in Alliance states and territories is also relatively modest, as most Alliance members already have ambitious clean energy mandates in place. This analysis does not account for the significant benefits of these federal actions for emissions in the rest of the United States, where they would likely lead to more dramatic reductions given the comparatively higher reliance on fossil fuels to generate electricity.

Perhaps most significantly, President Biden signed the effective deployment of federal executive authority IRA into law in 2022, concluding a historic legislative across more than 20 specific recommendations session that resulted in the largest investment in laid out by the Alliance for federal climate action. climate in U.S. history. The law’s enactment followed public calls by Alliance governors for Congress to As benefits of the IRA and IIJA become fully realized pass a bold climate and clean energy package, over time, Alliance states and territories will continue to recognizing that states and territories cannot act work collaboratively alongside the federal government alone to meet the nation’s climate goals.

Collaborating Across Government to Speed America’s Net-Zero Transition 84UNITED STATES CLIMATE ALLIANCE 2023 Annual Report BOX 4 Scaling Impact Examples of Alliance Member IIJA and IRA Successes Michigan mobilizes for federal funds In response to the passage of the IIJA, IRA, and CHIPS and Science Act, Michigan has aggressively mobilized to secure federal funding opportunities, particularly to implement the state’s landmark MI Healthy Climate Plan. This mobilization included creating the Michigan Infrastructure Office (MIO), the state’s federal funding coordinating office; signing executive directives to prepare state agencies for formula-funding opportunities; and creating and convening a dedicated subcabinet and topical working groups to address challenges, discuss key decisions, and ensure that staff coordinates as efficiently as possible, including one role devoted exclusively to climate and energy-funding priorities. Governor Whitmer also proposed and secured $337 million for the Make it in Michigan Competitiveness Fund, which is intended to provide enabling funds to unlock federally backed investments. In addition, MIO launched a technical assistance program to help communities leverage federal funding opportunities by providing support, planning, and matching grants to connect locals, Tribal governments, and other eligible entities with consulting services to help identify, apply for, manage, and administer federal grant funding. Pennsylvania spearheads workforce transformation Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro announced the Commonwealth Workforce Transformation Program (CWTP), a first-of-its-kind program created via Executive Order 2023-17 in August 2023 to bolster and expand its infrastructure workforce. Under the program, the commonwealth will reserve 3 percent of IRA and IIJA funding received from the federal government specifically to promote workforce development and on-the-job training, leading to as much as $400 million being invested directly in training Pennsylvania’s workers over the next five years. Importantly, organizations within the commonwealth receiving IRA and IIJA funding are also eligible to receive up to $40,000 for each new worker trained. The program is expected to support as many as 10,000 jobs by preparing Pennsylvanians for next-generation infrastructure jobs, including those modernizing energy, water, and sewer infrastructure. Collaborating Across Government to Speed America’s Net-Zero Transition 85UNITED STATES CLIMATE ALLIANCE 2023 Annual Report BOX 4 Continued New Mexico unleashes wind and solar manufacturing power Belen, New Mexico, is the future site of Arcosa, Inc.’s newest wind-tower manufacturing facility. Fueled by IRA incentives, Arcosa bought an extant facility in Belen’s Rio Grande Industrial Park and intends to create over $314 million in economic impact for the area in the next decade — creating a New Mexico-grown wind-tower supply chain to build wind farms all over the Southwest. Belen is just the beginning of clean energy manufacturing in New Mexico: in August 2023, Governor Lujan Grisham, along with the state’s federal delegation and the mayor of Albuquerque, celebrated the announcement of Maxeon Solar Technology’s $1 billion investment in a solar cell and panel manufacturing center in Mesa del Sol, near Albuquerque. The new factory will create more than 1,800 domestic jobs in clean energy manufacturing and engineering, further demonstrating how New Mexico has capitalized on the job-creating provisions of the IRA, private investment, and the state’s commitment to the clean energy transition. Colorado welcomes IRA investment boom In August 2023, Colorado Governor Polis joined the state’s federal lawmakers to mark the one-year anniversary of the IRA in Brighton, Colorado, the site of a surge in private-sector investment since passage of the landmark legislation. Following receipt of an offer of state incentives from the Colorado Economic Development Commission, solar manufacturer VSK Energy Inc. announced its intent in June 2023 to invest $250 million in a new solar photovoltaic module assembly facility in the Denver suburb. The investment will add to Colorado’s $4.6 billion cleantech economy, according to the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, and is projected to bring 900 net new jobs. Other private investments include Ampirus establishing a new lithium-ion manufacturing facility in Brighton, Fortesque Future Industry selecting Colorado for its clean hydrogen innovation center, and CS Wind doubling its wind tower facility in Pueblo. Governor Polis cited tax credits made possible by the IRA as a significant driver of these ventures as well as an overall growth in clean energy and manufacturing projects throughout Colorado. Collaborating Across Government to Speed America’s Net-Zero Transition 86UNITED STATES CLIMATE ALLIANCE 2023 Annual Report BOX 4 Continued Oregon bolsters climate action workforce In 2023, Oregon broadened its climate action workforce to prepare for the expected influx of 171 million federal-formula dollars made available through IIJA and IRA. By building staff capacity, the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) would engage more frequently and meaningfully with communities to ensure the federally funded programs will best serve Oregonians, especially those in traditionally underserved communities. This included adding new staff members with specialized expertise, such as a federal grants officer for the state’s IIJA Grid Resilience Program and a new community navigator program staff member that will provide enhanced outreach and help environmental justice communities (including Tribes, rural areas, low-income areas, and communities of color) access dollars and technical assistance for energy projects. At the same time, the ODOE-supported Oregon Global Warming Commission — soon to be called the Oregon Climate Action Commission — will be bolstered with expanded membership, including a representative with environmental justice experience, a youth representative, and the directors of additional state agencies to enhance the state’s whole-of-government approach. ODOE will continue to bring on additional procurement, human resources, management, equity, and policy positions in preparation for anticipated federal funding. • Strengthening federal light-, medium-, and heavy- Recommending federal executive duty vehicle standards by adopting GHG emissions actions to speed America’s net-zero and fuel economy standards before 2024. transition • Empowering states to set more stringent vehicle emission standards by approving California The Alliance kicked off 2023 by calling on the Biden waiver requests under the Clean Air Act. administration to advance a series of additional federal climate actions through the remainder of • Tackling GHG emissions from industrial facilities the president’s term that will support states and and electricity generation by rapidly adopting accelerate the nation’s transition to a net-zero future. new standards under the Clean Air Act.

Since the letter was sent, the Biden administration has advanced several crucial efforts in alignment with Alliance members’ recommendations, including proposed rules strengthening vehicle emission and fuel economy standards, waivers affirming the authority of states to tackle heavy-duty truck pollution, and proposed rules targeting GHG emissions in power plants. The letter will continue to provide a foundation for collaboration and engagement with the federal government as Alliance governors work to raise federal ambition and ensure a stringent federal floor in the coming year. Over the course of 2023, Alliance members also provided detailed recommendations on the development of federal programs, policies, and regulations through coalition-wide and multi-state letters to federal agencies. These comment letters included: • Letter providing input on design and deployment of IRA’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grants.356 • Letter encouraging an update to the federal government’s Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases estimates.357 Photo credit: U.S. Climate Alliance • Letter calling for stringent final vehicle emission standards.358 Working together to increase • Letter supporting the rapid finalization of collective ambition strengthened power plant rules.359 As the end of President Biden’s term nears, the coalition’s partnership with the federal government is stronger than ever. Both the Biden administration and Alliance governors agree that achieving the nation’s climate goals at the scale and speed necessary requires bold and immediate action at the state, territorial, and federal levels. To deliver on their shared ambition, they have forged new and innovative partnerships in 2023 and brought top officials from Alliance states and territories together with federal leaders to collaborate on, scale up, and inform innovative climate solutions to make our common 2030 and 2050 targets a reality (See Box 5).

Looking Ahead to 2024 and Beyond 90UNITED STATES CLIMATE ALLIANCE 2023 Annual Report Appendix I: Decarbonization Scenario Analysis The U.S. Climate Alliance commissioned analysis from Energy and Environmental Economics, Inc. (E3) to analyze possible trajectories for Alliance-wide GHG emissions through 2050. The E3 analysis was conducted using the PATHWAYS model with electricity sector analysis informed by the National Renewable Energy Lab 2022 Standard Scenarios. This appendix details the modeling methodology and scenario assumptions used in the analysis. PATHWAYS Model PATHWAYS is an economy-wide energy demand and from both existing devices and new electrification greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions accounting model loads. In addition, PATHWAYS produces liquid and that tracks all annual final energy consumption and gaseous fuel demands that are used as inputs to the GHG emissions sources and sinks. PATHWAYS takes a low-carbon fuels and negative emissions technology “bottom-up” approach, meaning it accounts for changes (NET) module, which optimizes the production of in demand for energy services and changes to the biomass-based and synthetic low-carbon fuels and efficiency and fuel type of equipment used to meet those deployment of NETs based on biomass feedstock service needs in order to endogenously calculate final supply, energy prices, and emissions targets. energy demand. Users translate policies and technology trends into scenario inputs that determine changes in physical infrastructure and energy consumption patterns, and the model then quantifies the effect of those changes on overall economy-wide GHG emissions. PATHWAYS Analysis for this year’s Annual Report uses a stock rollover approach in order to accurately was conducted with support from America Is All In. capture the effects of policies like vehicle fuel economy www.americaisallin.com standards (CAFE standards), building energy efficiency codes, and adoption of zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) over time (see Figure 1). PATHWAYS tracks the lifetime of installed building equipment and vehicles and provides useful results such as annual sales of zero-emissions vehicles required to meet a ZEV target, annual reductions in energy demand from increased adoption of efficient building shells, and total electricity demand by sector Appendix 91UNITED STATES CLIMATE ALLIANCE 2023 Annual Report FIGURE 1. Example of PATHWAYS Model Stock Rollover Functionality for Light- Duty Vehicles The E3 PATHWAYS model includes a representation of the following sectors: • Residential buildings • Commercial buildings • Industry • Transportation • Non-energy/non-combustion sectors • Agriculture • Industrial processes and product uses (IPPU) • Coal mining and abandoned mines • Natural gas and oil systems • Solid waste and wastewater • Land-use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) PATHWAYS includes a stock rollover representation for 16 residential building sectors such as space heating, water heating, and lighting; nine commercial building sectors; and six on-road transportation sectors including light-duty automobiles, heavy-duty trucks, and buses. Other consuming sectors like industrial energy demand and aviation are accounted for with total annual energy consumption by fuel and total annual emissions by pollutant. The default geography for the U.S. PATHWAYS model is the nine U.S. census divisions, with state level inputs aggregated and weighted based on historical economic activity, energy consumption, and GHG emissions. For this analysis, E3 modeled eight regions representing only the U.S. Climate Alliance states in each census division (no states in the East South Central census division are currently members of the Climate Alliance). The list of modeled states by census division is below: Appendix 92UNITED STATES CLIMATE ALLIANCE 2023 Annual Report Census Division Alliance Members Modeled New England CT, ME, MA, RI, VT Middle Atlantic NJ, NY, PA East North Central IL, MI, WI West North Central MN South Atlantic DE, MD, NC East South Central None West South Central LA Mountain AZ, CO, NM Pacific CA, HI, OR, WA Electricity sector approach Electricity sector costs and emissions for this analysis leveraged the NREL 2022 Standard Scenarios,364 NREL Annual Technology Baseline (ATB),365 and EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2023 (AEO).366 State-level outputs for electricity capacity and generation by resource from the NREL Standard Scenarios were combined with capital costs for generating resources from ATB, transmission and distribution cost escalators from AEO, and fuel prices from AEO to yield an annual electricity emissions rate and average retail price for each scenario. The Reference scenario used capacity and generation outputs from the NREL Mid-case with Current Policies, which includes IRA incentives and binding state electricity policies like renewable portfolio standards or clean electricity standards. The Collective Action scenario used capacity and generation outputs from the NREL High Demand case with 100% net-zero emissions by 2035, with adjustments made so that the achievement of 100% was delayed until 2050 and to replace unabated natural gas combined-cycle plants with combined-cycle with carbon-capture-and-storage (CCS) plants and unabated natural gas combustion turbine plants with renewable gas combustion turbine plants. The resulting annual electricity emissions rate and average retail price of electricity were then combined with annual electricity demands from PATHWAYS to determine total electricity sector costs and emissions. Appendix 93UNITED STATES CLIMATE ALLIANCE 2023 Annual Report Approach to Modeling Puerto Rico and Guam Emissions from Puerto Rico and Guam were modeled outside of the stock-rollover and energy demand accounting of PATHWAYS. Base year emissions for these territories came from the ClimateDeck,367 which had emissions estimates for the transportation and electric power sectors. This study assumed that sectoral emissions in Puerto Rico and Guam followed the same trend as emissions for the Alliance as a whole for each scenario modeled. Puerto Rico and Guam are included in Alliance-wide emissions results, but are not reflected in other modeling outputs such as the costs and benefits analysis. Scenario Inputs The U.S. Climate Alliance designed four scenarios of Alliance-wide GHG emissions: 1. Reference Scenario: Includes existing and final statutory/regulatory measures in Alliance states as of June 1, 2023, but no new policies. 2. Federal Action Scenario: Includes potential additional regulatory action at the federal level to further reduce GHG emissions. 3. Collective Action Scenario: Alliance states and/or the federal government take a suite of ambitious actions to achieve 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. 4. Existing GHG Targets Scenario: Alliance members put additional policies and actions into place to achieve their individual GHG emissions reduction goals. Detailed input assumptions for each of these scenarios are described in the sections that follow. Appendix 94UNITED STATES CLIMATE ALLIANCE 2023 Annual Report Reference Scenario The Reference Scenario is designed to align with key drivers and outputs (such as population or VMT growth) from EIA AEO 2023 at the national level. This scenario reflects a ‘business-as-usual’ future with no new policies but includes existing state and federal statutory/regulatory measures as of June 1, 2023, including the IRA, with additional state-specific adjustments made based on input from Alliance members.

In this analysis, the economy-wide costs of the Collective Action scenario can be compared to those of the Reference scenario to evaluate the relative costs of achieving the Alliance’s climate goals. In addition to direct costs, the model also includes an evaluation of health and climate benefits using EPA tools and guidance. These benefits are critical to include when evaluating the net costs and benefits of decarbonization.

The largest driver of additional emissions reductions in the near-term is the achievement of aviation decarbonization targets, highlighting this sector as a prime opportunity for strong federal action — and one that states are unlikely to be able to address alone, in light of federal preemption issues. While EPA’s proposed vehicle emissions standards help increase ZEV adoption, benefits are consolidated in Alliance jurisdictions that have not yet adopted the ACC II and Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) regulations. The impact of proposed power plant regulations in Alliance states and territories is also relatively modest, as most Alliance members already have ambitious clean energy mandates in place. This analysis does not account for the significant benefits of these federal actions for emissions in the rest of the United States, where they would likely lead to more dramatic reductions given the comparatively higher reliance on fossil fuels to generate electricity.

This mobilization included creating the Michigan Infrastructure Office (MIO), the state’s federal funding coordinating office; signing executive directives to prepare state agencies for formula-funding opportunities; and creating and convening a dedicated subcabinet and topical working groups to address challenges, discuss key decisions, and ensure that staff coordinates as efficiently as possible, including one role devoted exclusively to climate and energy-funding priorities. Governor Whitmer also proposed and secured $337 million for the Make it in Michigan Competitiveness Fund, which is intended to provide enabling funds to unlock federally backed investments. In addition, MIO launched a technical assistance program to help communities leverage federal funding opportunities by providing support, planning, and matching grants to connect locals, Tribal governments, and other eligible entities with consulting services to help identify, apply for, manage, and administer federal grant funding. Pennsylvania spearheads workforce transformation Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro announced the Commonwealth Workforce Transformation Program (CWTP), a first-of-its-kind program created via Executive Order 2023-17 in August 2023 to bolster and expand its infrastructure workforce. Under the program, the commonwealth will reserve 3 percent of IRA and IIJA funding received from the federal government specifically to promote workforce development and on-the-job training, leading to as much as $400 million being invested directly in training Pennsylvania’s workers over the next five years. Importantly, organizations within the commonwealth receiving IRA and IIJA funding are also eligible to receive up to $40,000 for each new worker trained. The program is expected to support as many as 10,000 jobs by preparing Pennsylvanians for next-generation infrastructure jobs, including those modernizing energy, water, and sewer infrastructure.

Belen is just the beginning of clean energy manufacturing in New Mexico: in August 2023, Governor Lujan Grisham, along with the state’s federal delegation and the mayor of Albuquerque, celebrated the announcement of Maxeon Solar Technology’s $1 billion investment in a solar cell and panel manufacturing center in Mesa del Sol, near Albuquerque. The new factory will create more than 1,800 domestic jobs in clean energy manufacturing and engineering, further demonstrating how New Mexico has capitalized on the job-creating provisions of the IRA, private investment, and the state’s commitment to the clean energy transition. Colorado welcomes IRA investment boom In August 2023, Colorado Governor Polis joined the state’s federal lawmakers to mark the one-year anniversary of the IRA in Brighton, Colorado, the site of a surge in private-sector investment since passage of the landmark legislation. Following receipt of an offer of state incentives from the Colorado Economic Development Commission, solar manufacturer VSK Energy Inc. announced its intent in June 2023 to invest $250 million in a new solar photovoltaic module assembly facility in the Denver suburb. The investment will add to Colorado’s $4.6 billion cleantech economy, according to the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, and is projected to bring 900 net new jobs. Other private investments include Ampirus establishing a new lithium-ion manufacturing facility in Brighton, Fortesque Future Industry selecting Colorado for its clean hydrogen innovation center, and CS Wind doubling its wind tower facility in Pueblo.

(E3) to analyze possible trajectories for Alliance-wide GHG emissions through 2050. The E3 analysis was conducted using the PATHWAYS model with electricity sector analysis informed by the National Renewable Energy Lab 2022 Standard Scenarios. This appendix details the modeling methodology and scenario assumptions used in the analysis. PATHWAYS Model PATHWAYS is an economy-wide energy demand and from both existing devices and new electrification greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions accounting model loads. In addition, PATHWAYS produces liquid and that tracks all annual final energy consumption and gaseous fuel demands that are used as inputs to the GHG emissions sources and sinks. PATHWAYS takes a low-carbon fuels and negative emissions technology “bottom-up” approach, meaning it accounts for changes (NET) module, which optimizes the production of in demand for energy services and changes to the biomass-based and synthetic low-carbon fuels and efficiency and fuel type of equipment used to meet those deployment of NETs based on biomass feedstock service needs in order to endogenously calculate final supply, energy prices, and emissions targets. energy demand. Users translate policies and technology trends into scenario inputs that determine changes in physical infrastructure and energy consumption patterns, and the model then quantifies the effect of those changes on overall economy-wide GHG emissions. PATHWAYS Analysis for this year’s Annual Report uses a stock rollover approach in order to accurately was conducted with support from America Is All In. capture the effects of policies like vehicle fuel economy www.americaisallin.com standards (CAFE standards), building energy efficiency codes, and adoption of zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) over time (see Figure 1).

Other consuming sectors like industrial energy demand and aviation are accounted for with total annual energy consumption by fuel and total annual emissions by pollutant. The default geography for the U.S. PATHWAYS model is the nine U.S. census divisions, with state level inputs aggregated and weighted based on historical economic activity, energy consumption, and GHG emissions.

The Reference scenario used capacity and generation outputs from the NREL Mid-case with Current Policies, which includes IRA incentives and binding state electricity policies like renewable portfolio standards or clean electricity standards. The Collective Action scenario used capacity and generation outputs from the NREL High Demand case with 100% net-zero emissions by 2035, with adjustments made so that the achievement of 100% was delayed until 2050 and to replace unabated natural gas combined-cycle plants with combined-cycle with carbon-capture-and-storage (CCS) plants and unabated natural gas combustion turbine plants with renewable gas combustion turbine plants.
