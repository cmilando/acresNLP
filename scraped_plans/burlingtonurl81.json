of Natural Resources (WVDNR) completed the State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP) with the input of numerous stakeholders from across the state, including public agencies and land managers, researchers, local and regional conservation organizations, volunteer groups, private landowners and members of the public. The 2015 SWAP identified 21 Conservation Focus Areas (CFAs), each with a distinctive set of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), wildlife habitats, stresses that can adversely affect those species, and conservation opportunities to address those stresses. In 2018 the WVDNR and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) began convening a working group of local stakeholders including public agencies and land managers, watershed groups, cave interest groups and other non-profit conservation organizations working in the area to develop this Action Plan for the North Fork Mountain- Thorn Creek CFA. This Action Plan addresses the eight essential elements required in the SWAP. It provides an overview of the landscape and major habitat types within this CFA, including forest and woodland habitats, rock outcrop, cliffs and talus and shale barren habitats, aquatic, floodplain and riparian habitats, karst and cave habitats, and developed and agricultural habitats. It also identifies 240 plant and animal SGCN that are priorities for conservation within this CFA based on factors such as their abundance, distribution, population trends and opportunities for conservation. For each major habitat type the Action Plan lists the priority species, stresses, and voluntary actions that can be taken by private landowners, public land managers and partner organizations for the conservation of wildlife species and their habitats. Climate stresses impacting each major habitat type and potential actions to boost their resilience are also listed. A plan for implementation for each major habitat type lists partners and programs available to assist with each of the actions and metrics for monitoring conservation success. There is also a summary of other human benefits that may be generated by the proposed conservation actions in each major habitat type. The Action Plan also describes a regional network of resilient and connected landscapes within which wildlife species can adapt and shift to a changing climate, identifies high integrity as well as resilient and connected landscapes within the CFA, and provides an implementation plan for landscape resilience and connectivity. The plan concludes with a summary of the priority habitats for conservation, describes the importance of combining conservation actions for greater impact and connecting them across the landscape for climate resilience, and outlines next steps in plan implementation. Local stakeholders can use this plan to identify priority species, the habitats and stresses within the CFA, as well as partners who can assist with planning, implementation and monitoring of conservation actions to conserve wildlife and enable climate adaptation. The information in this plan can also be used to inform conservation projects being planned by partners and provide justification for grant applications and other proposals seeking to conserve priority species and habitats. Local stakeholders can also work with relevant agencies to develop strategies to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts to priority species, their habitats, and the resilient and connected landscapes within this CFA. Conserving wildlife species and their habitat within this CFA will rely upon the voluntary actions of local landowners, public agencies and partner organizations, with support from the WVDNR. WVDNR will convene a working group of local stakeholders on a regular basis to provide guidance, assistance and support the plan, implement, and monitor conservation actions, facilitate stakeholder collaboration, and update the Action Plan every 10 years or sooner if needed. 1Introduction to the State Wildlife Action Plan & Conservation Focus Areas The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR) manages the state’s wildlife resources as part of the public trust. A goal of the WVDNR is to support and promote a sense of ownership in the conservation community and the public for the unique habitats and wildlife resources in West Virginia. The 2015 West Virginia State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP) was therefore developed to also function as a blueprint for conservation that other natural resource agencies, local governments, non-governmental organizations, and the general public can use and apply (WVDNR 2015). The SWAP is intended to have a ten-year timeframe and to be updated by 2025. Species of Greatest Conservation Need, Habitats and Stresses The 2015 SWAP identified 681 wildlife Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) across the state. Because plants are a fundamental element of habitat for wildlife SGCN, a list of SGCN plants was also developed, including 482 plant species. The SWAP classified and mapped nineteen terrestrial habitats across the state. These include 16 natural or semi-natural habitats that are derived from NatureServe’s Ecological Systems (Comer et al. 2003, Gawler 2008) and three anthropogenic habitats that represent map classes of the National Land Cover Database (Homer et al. 2004). In addition, the SWAP classified and mapped eighteen aquatic habitat types. These are GIS-derived types based on a simplification for West Virginia of the Northeast Aquatic Habitat Classification System (Anderson et al. 2013). Stream size is considered the most influential effect on determining biological assemblages at the reach scale and is divided into four primary classes: headwaters and creeks, small rivers, medium rivers, and large rivers. Stream slope, or gradient, affects aquatic communities at the reach scale due to its influence on stream bed morphology, water velocity, and sediment dynamics. Three relative classes (low, moderate, high) of gradient are used to define West Virginia’s streams. Water temperature in streams is a key physiological characteristic determining where different stream organisms may persist. Temperature affects seasonal migrations, growth rates, body condition, and fecundity of biota. Three temperature classes (cold, cool, warm) based on continuously recorded data and modeled environmental variables were used to determine biological constraints on stream communities in this model. The characteristics, distribution, trends, and threats associated with each of the terrestrial and aquatic habitats are described in the 2015 SWAP. This Conservation Focus Area Action Plan uses those same habitat classifications. For those SGCN listed in the SWAP and their associated habitats, WVDNR staff developed a statewide stress assessment using the classification system of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Terrestrial stresses were addressed at the habitat level within ecoregions. Aquatic stresses were addressed at the HUC 8 watershed level within ecoregions. The resulting analysis identified 21 major statewide stresses affecting terrestrial SGCN and habitats and 20 major stresses that affect aquatic SGCN and habitats. Stresses exerted on SGCN populations and habitats can reduce species populations either directly, by disease, or indirectly, by affecting the quality or quantity of available habitat. Conservation Actions The purpose of stress assessment and prioritization in the 2015 SWAP was to identify statewide conservation actions that could reduce stress on SGCN populations and their habitats. Most stresses are the result of the lawful activities of people, corporations, and public agencies. Rather than seeking a 2regulatory approach to restrict lawful activities, the intention of the SWAP was to promote voluntary collaboration with landowners, corporations, and other partner organizations and agencies to reduce stresses on wildlife species and their habitats. Conservation actions vary according to the species and the specific stresses being addressed and can take many forms. A lack of information on the status of a species or understanding of a threat may indicate a need for actions such as baseline inventory, research, or data acquisition. Direct action may involve directly protecting or restoring habitats. Conservation easements are a form of habitat protection that preserves habitat in its current state or can include land management plans that benefit wildlife. It is likely that a suite of actions is required, depending on the identified stress and the conservation opportunities available. Ideally, actions are designed to address the source of the stress (AFWA 2011). Conservation actions must also address habitat integrity and ecosystem processes. This includes conserving or preserving intact and functional habitats, protecting, or restoring aquatic resources, and maintaining and restoring connectivity between habitats (AFWA 2012, Byers and Norris, 2011). Conservation Focus Areas and Action Plans The SWAP provides a broad framework for conservation across West Virginia. However, wildlife species are concentrated in different parts of the state, and exposed to multiple, and often similar, stresses at state, regional, and local scales. Conservation Focus Areas (CFAs) are specific regions in the state where SGCNs are concentrated, addressable threats are identified, and where feasible opportunities exist for focused actions that will achieve success. In completing the 2015 SWAP, WVDNR defined 21 CFAs across the state based on these factors. The map on the following page illustrates the CFAs in West Virginia. In addition to conservation actions at the statewide level, the 2015 SWAP envisioned that planning at the CFA level would be necessary to fully implement successful conservation, and to further define conservation actions and measurable outcomes for most SWAP-based activities. The SWAP also noted that investing conservation resources in the CFAs could increase the potential for collaboration with partners and landowners, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of conservation on the ground. CFA Action Plans have been developed to identify priority SGCN from each taxa group in each major habitat type, key stresses and actions that will effectively secure or protect priority species and their habitats within the CFA. The Action Plans also identify public lands that can provide opportunities for conservation in collaboration with public land managers. And because many SGCN and their habitats occur on private property within CFAs, conservation actions will require collaboration with private landowners, as well as partner organizations and stakeholder groups. Many local partners have relations with landowners as well as the expertise, capacity, resources, and funding to plan and implement the actions listed in CFA Action Plans. CFA planning engages local partners and stakeholders at a scale where collaboration can increase resources (funding, capacity) available for conservation action. WVDNR has engaged a working group of local partners in developing each CFA Action Plan and intends to facilitate, guide and support partner efforts in planning, implementation, and evaluation of conservation actions to implement the plans. 3Conservation Focus Areas in West Virginia. Climate Change and Resilience The 2015 SWAP listed climate change as a substantial threat to wildlife and plant populations, noting several recent studies. For example, an assessment of the relative vulnerability to climate change of 185 animal and plant species in West Virginia (Byers and Norris, 2011) identified natural and anthropogenic barriers to movement and dispersal, and physiological thermal and hydrological niches occupied by some species as risk factors correlated with vulnerability to climate change. Over half of the species assessed were determined to be vulnerable to climate change. This study and the SWAP identified climate change as a stressor particularly for cool and coldwater fish, mollusks, plants, terrestrial salamanders, and many species associated with wetlands and high elevation ecosystems. The SWAP listed habitat shifts and alterations as statewide stresses for terrestrial SGCN and it listed increasing frequency and severity of drought, storms and flooding and temperature extremes as statewide stresses for aquatic SGCN and habitats. The SWAP observed that even within taxonomic and habitat groupings, species may respond differently to climate change based on their sensitivity to factors such as temperature, moisture, and seasonal triggers. Furthermore, climate change acts in tandem with other stresses on wildlife and habitat, and actions to address those other stresses could decrease their vulnerability to climate change. And actions to address climate impacts would vary between CFAs, emphasizing restoration and expansion of vulnerable habitat types in some areas, or reducing habitat fragmentation in others. The SWAP further 4stated that efficient approaches to maintaining broad suites of species include maintaining functioning ecological systems, landscapes that are resilient to the effects of climate change, and ecological connectivity within and between landscapes. Rather than a species-specific approach, the SWAP therefore sought to address climate change broadly through additional vulnerability assessments for select species, statewide actions to reduce additional stresses on SGCN and their habitats, and more geographically focused actions in Conservation Focus Areas (CFAs). CFAs are an appropriate scale to promote climate resilience by identifying local actions to relieve stresses on SGCN, restore or expand vulnerably habitats, and maintain ecosystems process, landscape resilience and connectivity. Monitoring and Adaptive Management Monitoring of SGCN and their habitat is essential to establish better baseline data about species distribution, abundance, and population trends. The SWAP envisioned monitoring of species and habitat trends across the state, along with more intensive monitoring within CFAs through collaboration with local partners to gain more area-specific data and to address local threats with targeted conservation actions. Beyond monitoring SGCN and their habitat, successful wildlife conservation in CFAs will require monitoring the effectiveness of conservation actions and adapting those actions accordingly. The SWAP envisioned monitoring the results of conservation actions at the CFA level, and that CFA-level plans would incorporate measurement and monitoring protocols integrated with conservation actions themselves. Effectiveness measures indicate progress to date and whether the expected results are being realized. Conservation actions should be designed with enough specificity that project impacts and performance can be measured but broadly enough to benefit multiple species and engage partners. Success may be measured by the amount of protected or restored habitat, by stable or increasing populations, or by acquiring a more complete understanding of species and threats in order to make informed conservation decisions. Another measure of success is the amount of “buy-in” or participation by conservation partners in the public and private sectors. Conservation partners, especially those operating through grant funding or those following conservation agency protocols, may already have metrics for accomplishment/success that are used for their own reporting requirements. Furthermore, accountability and transparency to funding sources, partners, and the public are essential for program success. Adaptive management also requires monitoring of climate change impacts on species, their habitats, and the success of conservation actions. Conservation actions are intended to reduce stresses on SGCN and their habitats, and to enable species to adapt to changing conditions. In common terms, climate adaptation may be thought of as preparing for, coping with, or adjusting to climatic changes and their associated impacts (Stein et al. 2014). Planning conservation actions for climate adaptation will require consideration of climate impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation options, and careful monitoring of project effectiveness and ecological response. Frameworks such as the Climate Smart Conservation Cycle illustrated below (from Stein et. al, 2014) can be used to plan, implement, and monitor conservation actions to enable wildlife to adapt to a changing climate. Planning and monitoring conservation actions may be informed by the climate impacts to species and habitats, WVDNR’s ongoing vulnerability assessments and field surveys to further document the distribution, abundance, and population trends of priority species, and the options to build the resilience of each major habitat type listed in this Action Plan. Information on site conditions and project plans provided by partners and landowners should also be considered. This will require careful coordination among WVDNR and local stakeholders. 5Organization of this Action Plan This CFA Action Plan will begin by introducing the CFA, including an overview of the landscape, terrestrial and aquatic habitats, species of greatest conservation need, distinctive stresses and broad conservation actions, potential partners and lands protected by public ownership or conservation easements. The Action Plan then reviews the conservation goals and lists priority species identified by WVDNR specialists based on factors such as their abundance, population trends and opportunities for conservation within the CFA. The Action Plan is then divided by major habitat type, including forest and woodland habitats, rock outcrop, cliffs and talus and shale barren habitats, aquatic, floodplain and riparian habitats, karst and cave habitats, and developed and agricultural habitats. For each major habitat type the Action Plan lists priority species, stresses effecting those species, and actions to alleviate those stresses. The Action Plan also identifies climate stresses impacting each major habitat type and lists potential actions to boost their resilience. The Action Plan provides a plan for implementation and monitoring of conservation actions for each major habitat type, and a brief statement about other human benefits that may be generated by the proposed actions. The Action Plan also describes a regional network of resilient and connected landscapes spanning multiple habitat types to enable wildlife species to adapt and shift to a changing climate and provides an implementation plan for landscape resilience and connectivity. The conclusion provides a summary of the priority habitats for conservation, describes the importance of integrating conservation actions for greater impact and connecting conservation actions for climate resilience, and outlines next steps in plan implementation. 6How to use this plan Implementation of this plan will rely upon voluntary actions by local stakeholders including landowners, public agencies and partner organizations, and collaboration between them to conserve wildlife species and their habitat. The role of WVDNR in implementing this Action Plan is to provide local stakeholders with information, guidance, assistance, and support to plan, implement, and monitor conservation actions, and facilitate stakeholder collaboration. Local stakeholders can use this plan for many purposes, including the following: • Identify priority wildlife species, rare plant communities and their habitats, and the resilient and connected landscapes that can enable species to shift in response to changing conditions. • Work with relevant agencies to develop strategies to avoid, minimize and mitigate for impacts to priority species, their habitats, and the resilient and connected landscapes. • Identify stresses on priority species in specific habitats, conservation actions that can alleviate those stresses, monitoring protocols to evaluate success, and partners who can provide assistance. • Understand climate impacts on wildlife habitat, and actions to boost habitat resilience. • Plan and implement conservation actions to alleviate stresses on wildlife species in specific habitat, boost habitat resilience, and enable wildlife to adapt to climate change. • Design and implement monitoring protocol to evaluate the success of conservation actions. • Inform and provide rationale for activities being proposed in grant or permit applications. • Integrate priority species, habitat, and climate resilience into other local project plans. The information provided in this Action Plan is constantly evolving. Local stakeholders are encouraged to seek additional information and assistance from WVDNR to: • Confirm whether specific priority wildlife species and habitats are present at specific sites • Understand their vulnerability to climate change • Further define or confirm stresses on wildlife species and habitats • Tailor proposed wildlife conservation actions to alleviate stresses • Consider adaptation options to boost habitat resilience to climate change • Develop effective strategies to monitor and evaluate project success 7The Cacapon River and Patterson Creek Conservation Focus Area Overview The Ridge and Valley Ecoregion includes the entire watersheds of the Cacapon River and Patterson Creek. The Cacapon watershed includes two large tributary drainages, the North River and Lost River. Both watersheds are in the Potomac Basin and have many ecological and land-use similarities. A map of the CFA is on the following page. The valleys in both the Cacapon and Patterson Creek watersheds are below 1000 feet in elevation & have narrow, but well-developed floodplains along the larger streams. The shale uplands give way to parallel ridges of mostly shale and sandstone. Areas of limestone occur in both watersheds. Higher mountains, some rising above 3000 feet, include: ` • Cacapon Mountain • Patterson Creek Mountain • Great North Mountain • Knobly Mountain • Short Mountain • Allegheny Mountain (the Allegheny Front) • Long Mountain The ridgetops and upper slopes in this CFA are mostly forested, with several medium and large intact forest areas or “blocks” remaining primarily in the Cacapon Watershed. Privately owned forestland is mostly in small to medium sized tracts and used for forestry and recreation. Some of the lower ridges support apple orchards, while lower uplands & river bottoms are mostly used for agriculture. Agriculture practices are primarily livestock production and include pasture and hay lands and corn production. Poultry operations also occur in both watersheds. Residential development is prevalent in the Cacapon Watershed, especially along the Cacapon River downstream of North River and adjacent to public land. Small towns in the Cacapon watershed include Wardensville and Capon Bridge. There is substantial public land in the eastern portion of the Cacapon Watershed, including the George Washington National Forest, Cacapon State Park, Sideling Hill Wildlife Management Area, and Short Mountain Wildlife Management Area. Lost River State Park lies in the southwest portion of the watershed. Communities and towns present in the Patterson Creek watershed include Williamsport, Burlington, and Fort Ashby. There are no state or federal lands in the Patterson Creek watershed. 8Overview 9Habitats The Cacapon River and Patterson Creek CFA includes a variety of terrestrial, subterranean, and aquatic habitat types. Terrestrial Habitats This Action Plan uses the terrestrial habitat types described in the SWAP, fourteen of which are present in this CFA. This CFA includes over 15% of the state’s dry calcareous forests and its pine oak rocky woodlands. Shale barrens represent a tiny portion of the terrestrial habitats in this CFA yet represent over 22% of the state’s total shale barren habitat.

Headwater tributaries in both Cacapon River and Patterson Creek, although at low elevations, are cold water streams that support native Brook Trout populations. Streams and wetlands in the CFA support 28 dragonflies and damselflies SGCN (an unusually large number for West Virginia). These watersheds also include shale barrens that support associated endemic plants and lepidopterans including 14 SGCN moths and butterflies. This is also an important CFA for birds, including 44 SGCN. Pastures and hayfields are important for several grassland bird species. Upland forests, especially larger intact forest blocks on the national forest, support a suite of forest interior bird species. Altogether, the CFA supports 75 SGCN plants. The algific talus community (which holds subsurface ice into the summer) at Ice Mountain is a notable refugium for rare plants and snails, and the extensive, high quality wetlands on Short Mountain WMA are of global significance. This Action Plan will list the priority SGCN in each major habitat type in the CFA. 14Distinctive Stresses The 2015 SWAP lists several general stresses affecting SGCN and habitat in this CFA: • Development pressure is significant in the Cacapon Watershed, with substantial residential and second home development, especially along major streams and adjacent to public land. • Water quality impacts from agriculture and development exist throughout both watersheds. • Fragmenting intact forests increases surface water temperatures (and consequently headwater stream temperatures) and storm water run-off. In addition to this list of general stresses, this Action Plan will list more specific local stresses affecting priority SGCN in each major habitat type. Conservation Actions To address these stresses, the 2015 SWAP recommended that four main types of action in the CFA: 1. Promote practices for restoring riparian habitat, including streamside fencing and establishing riparian buffers, and for reducing sedimentation and nutrient runoff from farms. 2. Coordinate with the active land trust and farmland protection community to protect habitat through land conservation. 3. Engage public landowners to maintain large, intact forest blocks thus protecting many other special habitats. Develop forest management plans. 4. Implement a plan to enhance climate change resiliency through reducing other stressors (such as invasive species), identifying, maintaining, and creating key habitat cores and corridors, and protecting areas of high landscape complexity and integrity. These four broad actions are integrated into this Action Plan along with more specific conservation actions to address the stresses affecting priority SGCN in each major habitat type. Potential Partners The 2015 SWAP lists many potential partners for landowners and others interested in wildlife conservation in the CFA, including: • WV Division of Forestry, • County Farmland Protection Boards, • WV Department of Environmental • The Cacapon and Lost Rivers Land Trust, Protection, • Friends of the Cacapon, • USDA- Natural Resource Conservation • The Cacapon Institute, and Service, • Potomac Conservancy. • West Virginia Conservation Agency, With an established “constituency”, many conservation partners can provide direct outreach to landowners and key stakeholders interested in wildlife conservation. The WVDNR will engage with these and other partners in regular meetings and planning workshops during CFA planning, 15implementing conservation actions, and monitoring effectiveness. In many cases partners may assume a lead role in implementation. Appendix 1 lists the types of programming and assistance each partner provides to landowners. Specific partners are also listed along with conservation actions supported through their programs in the implementation plan for each habitat type. Protected Lands Public lands that can provide significant opportunities for wildlife conservation include: • George Washington National Forest • Short Mountain, Edwards Run, Nathaniel • Cacapon and Lost River State Parks Mountain, and Sideling Hill WMAs These public lands provide important wildlife habitat and are managed for conservation or other compatible goals. Appendix 3 lists habitat types occurring in each of the public lands within this CFA. WVDNR will work with public land managers to identify opportunities to plan and implement conservation actions that address stresses in these habitats and support priority SGCN. WVDNR will work with public land managers to identify opportunities to plan and implement conservation actions that address stresses in these habitats and support priority SGCN. On state lands, this may include protection of important ecosystems, habitats, SGCN populations or plant communities through designation as State Natural Areas. City and county-owned public lands may also be managed to benefit wildlife and habitat. In addition, land trusts and conservation organizations including the Cacapon and Lost River Land Trust and the Potomac Conservancy, as well as The Nature Conservancy, the county farmland protection boards, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and WV Division of Forestry’s Forest Legacy Program hold conservation easements on private lands that may protect important wildlife habitat and provide additional wildlife conservation opportunities. The next map shows the location of public lands and conservation easements in the CFA, based on data provided by The Conservation Fund (TCF), USGS Gap Analysis Program (GAP), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED) in 2015. It also shows known occurrences of SGCN and rare plant communities within 500- square meter areas, and the biodiversity rank (including global, state, or local significance) of those occurrences, as generated by WVDNR in 2017. This map illustrates that many SGCN and rare plant communities occur on public lands and conservation easements in the CFA, and there may be opportunities for WVDNR, public agencies and landowners to protect them there. Many SGCN and rare plant communicates also occur on private land outside of public lands and conservation easements. This indicates how important it is for WVDNR and other partners to work with private landowners to restore and protect biodiversity on private lands. Appendix 4 lists partners and programs that provide assistance to private landowners in wildlife conservation. 16Protected Lands and Biodiversity 17Action Plan for the Conservation Focus Area Conservation Goals The Cacapon River/Patterson Creek CFA Action Plan is an extension of the State Wildlife Action Plan. While it is driven by local issues, the overarching goals remain the same. These include: 1. Halt the decline of at-risk species and thus avoid the need for federal listing as threatened or endangered 2. Assist with the recovery of federally listed species 3. Keep the common species common 4. Conserve the full array of habitat types and biological diversity in the state The WVDNR will develop relationships with conservation partners and key stakeholders to support and promote natural resource stewardship and guide efforts that protect, restore, enhance, and otherwise benefit natural communities and processes. Only through collaboration with agency partners, non- governmental organizations and the public can we address threats to Species of Greatest Conservation Need, key habitats, and unique communities. Priority Species Effectiveness and efficiency are paramount in targeting actions in CFAs and specifically addressing every SGCN present in the CFA is not feasible. From the list of SGCN present in the CFA provided in the SWAP, WVDNR wildlife biologists selected priority species for conservation action that represent the best opportunity for successful conservation based on its population status and known trends in the CFA, the significance of each species at the global, state and local levels, the degree of dependence of each species on habitats within the CFA, conservation opportunities and likelihood of conservation success in the CFA, and other factors. The table below lists SGCN that were selected as priority species within the CFA based on the above criteria. Also listed are the priority species which are classified as rare, threatened or endangered species or as sensitive species by United States Forest Service’s Region 8 and as at risk species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, indicating that the agencies may target these species for conservation action and may provide additional technical and financial support. Additional field surveying and information is needed to document and monitor the distribution, abundance, and population trends of these priority species in the habitats where they occur, and to assess their vulnerability to climate change. This work is ongoing and will be included as an action in the implementation plan for each major habitat type that follows.

Dry Calcareous Forests, Woodlands and Glades and Pine-Oak Rocky Woodlands occupy smaller portions of the CFA but represent over 15% of those forest habitat types in the state. Smaller portions of forested areas are composed of Mixed Mesophytic Forests, Montane Red Oak Forests on some high ridge tops, and Northern Hardwood Forests. The following pages include maps of forest habitat types, and intact forest patches (based on the Appalachian and Mid-Atlantic Forest Patch Dataset compiled by The Nature Conservancy in 2011) with biodiversity. The diversity of forest types across elevational gradients provides great opportunities for their conservation within larger forest patches and requires careful management tied to specific site conditions and forest stand characteristics. Intact forest patches provide core habitat for a significant portion of the SGCN and rare communities, as well as a matrix of forest habitat types and large corridors within which forest species may shift and adapt to climate change. Priority Species The table below lists priority species in the CFA associated with forest and woodland habitats. Priority Species in Forest and Woodland Habitats. TAXA SCIENTIFIC NAME COMMON NAME Birds Buteo platypterus Broad-winged Hawk Birds Aquila chrysaetos Golden Eagle Birds Coccyzus erythropthalmus Black-billed Cuckoo Birds Hylocichla mustelina Wood Thrush Birds Setophaga discolor Prairie Warbler Birds Helmitheros vermivorum Worm-eating Warbler Birds Setophaga cerulea Cerulean Warbler Reptiles Glyptemys insculpta Wood Turtle Plants Lupinus perennis ssp. perennis Wild Lupine, Sundial Lupine *Plants Xerophyllum asphodeloides Eastern Turkeybeard *Plants Trifolium reflexum Buffalo Clover *These species may be extirpated; their status and location are unknown and requires surveying. Several priority bird species rely on Dry Mesic Oak Forests, which occupy the largest portion of the CFA. Several rare plant species are associated with Pine-Oak Rocky Woodlands and Dry Oak-Pine Forests, but additional surveying will be required to ascertain their status and location. Large forest patches provide core habitat for forest interior breeding birds, including Broad-winged Hawk, Wood Thrush, Cerulean Warbler and Worm-eating Warbler. Early successional habitats support Prairie Warbler, and Black-billed Cuckoo. Wood turtles rely on forested as well as aquatic habitats for different parts of their life history. They also rely on connections between those habitats for passage between them. 21Forest and Woodland Habitats 22Intact Forest Patches and Biodiversity 23Rare Plant Communities Dry Mesic Oak Forests and Calcareous Forests, Woodlands and Glades host several rare plant communities in this CFA. Note that over half of the state’s Eastern Ridges Oak-Hickory-Graminoid Forest are located here. These communities are vulnerable to disturbance by logging and grazing activities, and to the spread of non-native invasive plants. Disturbance should be avoided, and non-native invasive plant infestations should be treated. Rare Plant Communities in Forest and Woodland Habitats.

While efforts to manage and restore both early successional and interior forest habitat are needed for priority SGCN, restoration efforts should not convert one to the other. Early successional forest habitat forest restoration should take place in small patches of forest and along forest edges. Existing young forests can be enhanced outside of large blocks of interior forest. And efforts to restore and expand interior forest blocks should not generate an overall loss of early successional forest. Climate Change and Habitat Resilience The Central Appalachian Forest Ecosystem Vulnerability Assessment (Butler et. al, 2015) described many potential impacts of climate change on forests in the region. Likely impacts include increased temperatures (especially during the summer and fall), a decrease in winter snowpack, longer growing seasons, increased precipitation during spring and even greater decreases in precipitation during summer and fall, more frequent heavy precipitation events, and increasing frequency and severity of storms. These impacts will likely lead to changing soil moisture patterns, increased risk of wildfire, increased damage from pests and pathogens, and increased extent and abundance of invasive plants. Habitat for northern species is likely to decline, although species such as red spruce may persist in cool, wet microclimates. Tree seedlings will likely be more vulnerable to climate change impacts than mature trees. Forest ecosystems lacking a diversity of species, age classes and genotypes may be at greater risk from climate change than those with greater diversity. Forest species in fragmented landscapes will have less opportunity to migrate across the landscape in response to changing conditions, and ecological communities tied to specific hydrological conditions or geologic features may also be unable to migrate. Urban areas and impervious cover can exacerbate the effects of increasing temperatures and heavier precipitation. However, ecosystems within areas of high landscape complexity, including a diversity of topography and microhabitats, may be more able to persist and adapt in response to climate change. The 2015 assessment also described likely impacts to specific forest types. Dry Mesic Oak Forests support of large number of tree species over a diversity of terrain, and many of the tree species are tolerant of drought and fire, providing some resilience to climate change. Fire suppression and timber harvesting have allowed more mesic species to become dominant. But increased temperature and drought could increase the risk of wildfire. While low-intensity fires could restore fire-adapted species, severe fires, combined with drought and other stressors, could increase mortality of some species. Higher temperatures and drought may increase the susceptibility of these forests to invasive species, pests and pathogens, and drought as well as disturbances from stronger storms may enable the spread of non-native invasive plants. 25Dry Oak Pine Forests and Pine-Oak Rocky Woodlands are adapted to heat, drought and fire. While moderate increases in these drivers could benefit this forest type, severe drought and fire could lead to increased mortality of tree species. Droughts may increase susceptibility to forest pests and pathogens and enable non-native invasive plants to outcompete native herbs and shrubs, providing additional fuel for fires and increasing fire intensity. Forest pests, pathogens and invasive plants need to be carefully managed to build resilience to climate change. Dry Calcareous Forests, Woodlands and Glades are adapted to heat, drought and wildfire, but may be impacted by increased fire intensity, correlated with increases in invasive plant species. Management of invasive plants will be critical for the long-term resilience of the ecosystem. Dependence on unique soils may impede the ecosystem’s ability to shift across the landscape. Mixed Mesophytic Forests may be vulnerable to increasing disturbance by wildfire, drought and invasion by non-native plants. These ecosystems may decline in some areas, while sheltered sites in areas of complex topography may provide some refuge from climate change. Drought may increase the susceptibility of these forests to hemlock woolly adelgid, forest tent caterpillar, beech bark disease and other insect pests and diseases. Invasive plants may outcompete native species as conditions change, and drought may increase the risk of wildfire, to which these forests are not well adapted. The small areas of northern hardwood forests may be particularly impacted by climate change. Increased heat and moisture stress in summer and fall may interact with acid deposition as well as increases in insect pests and pathogens, storm disturbance and wildfires to stress these forests, reducing species diversity and coverage. Cool, moist sites within areas of complex topography may provide some refuge and buffer the effects of climate change. Some changes in forest composition and structure are likely to occur over time as these different forest types adapt and adjust in response to changes in climate. Conservation actions to reduce existing stresses on forests will aid in building their resilience. Protection of large forest patches in areas with complex topography and diverse microclimates, and maintaining forested connections between them, may further enable their adaptation and shifting distribution across the landscape. Below is a summary of climate stresses on forest habitats, and actions which could boost their resilience (Swanston et al, 2016). While climate stresses are listed separately, forest and woodland habitats are often impacted by a multiple climate stresses occurring simultaneously and actions to boost habitat resilience are intended to address multiple climate stresses. Many of these actions resemble previously listed conservation actions to reduce stress on priority species, meaning that they could have positive outcomes for priority species as well as habitat resilience. WVDNR, land managers, landowners and partners may select the actions best suited to their specific site conditions, management goals and objectives, from the list below or other sources. 26Climate Stresses and Resilience Actions in Forest and Woodland Habitats Climate Stresses Habitat Resilience Actions • Restore or maintain fire in fire-adapted ecosystems • Increased spring and summer • Manage deer herbivory to promote regeneration temperatures • Promptly revegetate sites after disturbance, • Increased risk of drought and wildfire prevent the introduction and establishment of • Increased frequency and severity of invasive plant species, and remove existing invasive storms, species • Increased competition from non-native • Promote diversity of native species and age classes invasive species, pests, and pathogens through planting and silviculture • Protect habitat refugia for rare plant communities and forest types dependent on unique soils, such as calcareous forests, woodlands, and glades • Protect forest reserves in areas of high biological diversity or priority species • Reduce forest fragmentation • Maintain or restore large patches and corridors of forest habitat • Restore native forest vegetation on degraded lands within and adjacent to forested areas Implementation Plan WVDNR will work with interested partners and landowners to plan, implement, and measure the effectiveness of conservation actions to benefit priority species in forest and woodland habitats.

A map illustrating the location of these rare habitat types is on the following page, and those in smaller forest patches may be more vulnerable to stresses. These habitat types, while covering only small areas, are priorities for the conservation of rare plant communities in this CFA. Rare Plant Communities Although there are no priority SGCN selected for these habitats, Shale Barrens and Acidic Rock Outcrops, Cliffs and Talus habitats provide core habitats for several rare plant communities, listed below. Over 40% of statewide occurrences of these communities are found in this CFA. These habitat types, while covering only small areas, are priorities for the conservation of rare plant communities in this CFA. Additional field surveying is needed to better understand and monitor the distribution and abundance of these rare communities.

Acidic rock outcrops, cliffs and talus and shale barren habitats are dependent on underlying geology, so their ability to shift across the landscape in response to climate change is very limited. While they are usually adapted to extreme conditions, they may be vulnerable to increased disturbance from drought, fire and storms, and from invasion by non-native invasive plants. Protecting and maintaining intact forest ecosystems around these rare habitats, and controlling invasive species, may help maintain resilience in a changing climate.

A map of aquatic habitat types is included in the introduction to the CFA. These streams and river habitats are tightly connected with their adjacent floodplains, wetlands and riparian habitats. Many wildlife species rely on aquatic habitats such as streams, rivers, and wetlands, as well as their adjacent terrestrial habitats, especially riparian areas and forests. Substantial portions of floodplain have been cleared for settlement and agriculture. The loss of natural floodplain habitats and riparian corridors often impacts water quality and adjacent aquatic habitat. And improving wildlife habitat in streams and rivers often requires conservation actions to improve adjacent floodplain and riparian habitats. Therefore aquatic, floodplain, wetland and riparian habitats will be addressed together. Priority Species The table below lists priority aquatic species in the CFA that occur in rivers and streams. This CFA contains more than half of the state’s occurrences of several species of mussel including Triangle Floater, Brook Floater, Yellow Lampmussel, as well as half of the state’s Wood Turtles and Spotted Turtles and at least 50% of three Dragonfly and Damselfly species: Yellow-sided Skimmer, Splendid Clubtail, and Spine-crowned Clubtail. Spotted Turtles also rely on adjacent wetland habitats.

Depression ponds and wetlands are classified as terrestrial habitats but are often tied to the hydrology of aquatic habitats and host similar species. The Yellow-sided Skimmer is a dragonfly/damselfly that relies on warm, low-gradient headwater streams as well as High Allegheny wetland habitats. And Bristle-brush Bulrush is associated with sinkholes and depression ponds. Like other aquatic environments, ponds and wetland habitats are influenced by land use practices in adjacent lands and waters. 35Priority Species in Depression Ponds and Wetlands TAXA SCIENTIFIC NAME COMMON NAME Plants Scirpus ancistrochaetus Barbed-bristle Bulrush Dragonflies and Damselflies Libellula flavida Yellow-sided Skimmer Although riparian and floodplain habitats are classified as terrestrial, they are closely connected to adjacent rivers and streams and host some of the same species, including Wood Turtles, Splendid Clubtails and Appalachian Jewelwings. Louisiana Waterthrush and Bank Swallows both rely on riparian and floodplain and habitats, as do rare plants including Harperella and Davis’ Sedge, the current status of which is unknown.

Rare Plant Communities The following rare plant communities may be found in aquatic, floodplain and riparian habitats in this CFA. Note that all the state’s Ridge and Valley Pitch Pine Peat Woodlands, and over half of its Red Maple-Black Gum Peatmoss Swamps and Tussock Sedge Wet Meadows are found in this CFA. These plant communities are vulnerable to disturbance and the spread of non-native invasive plants. Disturbance should be avoided, and non-native invasive plant infestations should be treated.

These areas provide core habitat and movement corridors for many of the priority species and rare plant communities listed above and are priority habitats. Patterson Creek, the Cacapon, North and Lost Rivers, Dillons Run, Trout Run, Waites Run and Tear Coat Creek are designated state mussel streams. These streams and several others support large clusters of biodiversity occurrences, and along with brook trout patches, require careful management to maintain those priority species. There is a large exemplary wetland complex in Short Mountain WMA that is home to SGCN and rare communities. In addition to providing important habitat for priority species, floodplain habitats along the larger rivers and numerous small stream riparian corridors are critical for maintaining the form and function of streams and rivers. Floodplain and riparian habitats and brook trout habitat patches outside of the larger forest patches may be more vulnerable to stresses. 37Riparian and Floodplain Habitats 38Mussel Streams, Wetlands, Brook Trout Habitat Patches 39Impaired Streams and Biodiversity 40Habitat Stresses and Conservation Actions Direct stresses to priority species include cattle trampling mussels and the over-fishing of eels and elvers. Common shiners may suffer from translocation and hybridization. Wood turtles and Spotted turtles suffer from the direct impacts of illegal collection and poaching. The table below lists habitat stresses on priority species, and conservation actions to alleviate those stresses. For example, protecting and restoring streamside riparian buffers is an important conservation action that improves water quality as well as both in-stream and riparian habitat for priority bird, fish, mussel, dragonfly/damselfly, and plant species. A map showing the biological and fecal/bacterial stream impairments on Patterson Creek and Lost River, and Algae impairment on the Cacapon (compiled by WVDEP in 2014) is on the previous page. These impaired streams are also home to clusters of SGCN and biological diversity. Improving water quality in these impaired streams is an important conservation action, especially where priority SGCN are present.

Impervious cover may exacerbate these impacts. Drought may stress plants and increase their susceptibility to wildfire, forest pests and pathogens. Warming temperatures and increased disturbances may enable non-native invasive plant species to outcompete native species. Although riparian forests are adapted to some level of disturbance and variable conditions, habitat alterations in agricultural and developed areas, habitat fragmentation and invasive species may limit the ability of riparian forests to adapt to climate change. 41The Assessment also describes how instream habitats and associated plant and animal species may be stressed by climate change-related increases in temperature, droughts, flood frequency and severity, and resulting erosion and sedimentation. Low flow events may also become more frequent and severe. Warming surface waters is likely to result in water quality degradation and eutrophication. Many aquatic species and life stages are adapted to specific timing and ranges of flow and temperature, as well as water quality variables. Climate change may impact different species and life stages in different ways. Cold water habitats and aquatic communities may be at particular risk. Areas within a watershed may be sensitive to increases in air temperature, depending on local factors such as watershed characteristics, position within the watershed, upstream land uses, groundwater contributions, forest cover and shading. Restoring and maintaining the health, size, and connectivity of native riparian forests along streams and rivers can provide riparian habitat, shade and cooling, organic matter, structure and debris, protect stream banks and in-stream habitat during high flows, and maintain water quality. Stabilizing eroding stream banks using natural channel design techniques, and reconnecting streams with their floodplains can restore fluvial processes and floodplain habitats. Cleaning and enlarging culverts and stream crossings to accommodate increased peak flows and aquatic organism passage can reduce flood damage to infrastructure and habitat and allow aquatic organisms to reach additional habitat as they adapt to changing conditions. Below is a summary of climate stresses on aquatic, floodplain and riparian habitat, and actions to boost their resilience (Swanston et. al, 2016). While climate stresses are listed separately, aquatic, floodplain and riparian habitats are often impacted by multiple climate stresses occurring simultaneously and actions to boost habitat resilience are intended to address multiple climate stresses. Many of these actions reiterate previously listed conservation actions to reduce stress on priority species and could have positive outcomes for priority species as well as habitat resilience. WVDNR, land managers, landowners and partners may select the actions best suited to their specific site conditions, management goals and objectives, from the list below or other sources.

Caves provide important habitat for bats that move in and out, as well as a diverse group of vertebrate and invertebrate animals that have evolved specialized adaptations to permanent underground living. Common traits exhibited by permanent cave dwellers (troglobites) include blindness (or complete loss of eyes) and reduced pigmentation. On the following pages, one map illustrates areas with karst geology running north to south in the central part of the CFA. Karst areas in smaller and more fragmented forest patches may be more vulnerable to stresses. The map on the subsequent page illustrates karst feature density with 3-kilometer buffers offset randomly, and one biologically significant cave near Wardensville with a 3-mile random offset buffer. This data was provided by the West Virginia Speleological Society, with offset buffers developed by WVDNR. Caves classified by WVDNR as biologically significant may host rare bat or endemic cave species, or exceptional biological diversity. These areas require careful management to minimize disturbance on karst and cave habitats and protect priority species. Priority Species Caves in this CFA provide core habitat for the following priority species, all of which are rare and dependent on specific cave habitats for their survival. Of special significance, this CFA hosts 67% of the state’s Allegheny Cave Amphipod, and 50% of the state’s Morrison’s Cave Amphipod.

The following table lists stresses affecting wildlife in caves and subterranean habitats, and conservation actions landowners and partners can take to address them. In addition, WVDNR is developing cave management plans for all biologically significant caves. The management plans will describe cave ownership, access, bats and other SGCN present, threats, surrounding areas requiring careful management, recommended access restrictions and conservation actions. 46Habitat Stresses and Conservation Actions for Karst and Cave Habitats Habitat Stress Conservation Action Education, wastewater treatment, fencing, riparian Water quality plantings Land protection, land use planning and careful Land use changes management around caves Climate Change and Habitat Resilience The Central Appalachians Forest Ecosystem Vulnerability Assessment (Butler et. al, 2015), noted that ecosystems that are limited by geological or hydrological features, such as cave and karst habitats, may be restricted from shifting across the landscape in response to climate change. However, cave and karst habitats that are connected more closely with groundwater inputs than surface water may be buffered by the impacts of climate change, and subterranean habitats may be buffered from increasing surface temperatures. But caves and karst areas may be vulnerable to groundwater extraction during droughts as well as changes in surface water flow regimes, nutrient inputs, high flows, and contaminants carried by floods, which may be exacerbated by impervious cover within the watershed (Swanston et. al, 2016). Restoring and maintaining riparian corridors, water quality and natural flow regimes, and limiting impervious cover in areas upstream and above caves and karst may boost the resilience of cave ecosystems. Some cave dwelling species also rely on adjacent forest, riparian and aquatic habitats. Maintaining the resilience of adjacent ecosystems could further buffer cave species from the impacts of climate change. Below is a summary of climate stresses on cave and karst habitats, and actions to boost their resilience. Although climate stresses are listed separately, subterranean habitats are often impacted by a multiple climate stresses occurring simultaneously and actions to boost habitat resilience are intended to address multiple climate stresses. Some of these actions repeat previously listed conservation actions to reduce stress on priority species and could benefit priority species while also boosting habitat resilience. WVDNR, partners and landowners can collaborate to select the habitat resilience actions best suited to site conditions, conservation goals and land management objectives. Climate Stresses and Resilience Actions in Karst and Cave Habitats Climate Stress: Habitat Resilience Action: • Increased flood frequency and severity, • Restore and protect surface water quality and hydrology nutrient inputs and contaminants • Limit impervious cover • Increased surface water temperatures, low- • Maintain ground water quality and quantity flow events, and ground water withdrawals • Maintain resilient forests, riparian and • Impacts to adjacent forest, riparian and aquatic habitat around karst and cave aquatic habitat ecosystems 47Karst Areas 48Karst and Cave Features Source: WV Speleological Society data, offset buffers developed by DNR 2019 49Implementation Plan WVDNR will work with landowners and the following partners and programs to implement and measure the impact of conservation actions around caves and karst habitat.

Some species even rely on habitat in more developed lands in residential and urban areas. Most agricultural lands and developed areas are in valley bottoms and floodplains. A map on the following page shows the location of agricultural and developed habitats and illustrates that they are associated with many examples of biodiversity. Maintaining pastures, fallow fields, woody vegetation, wetlands and riparian corridors is a priority for SGCN associated with these agricultural habitats. Priority Species Agricultural lands including cultivated crops, pastures, and hayfields, along with adjacent areas of natural vegetation in and around adjacent forests and woodlots, hedgerows, fallow areas, ponds, wetlands, streams, and riparian areas provide valuable habitat for several priority grassland bird species in the CFA. The following is a list of priority SGCN in the CFA associated with agricultural habitats. Developed areas also provide important habitat, most notably for the Chimney Swift. Priority Species in Agricultural and Developed Habitats TAXA SCIENTIFIC NAME COMMON NAME Birds Chaetura pelagica Chimney Swift Birds Tyto alba Barn Owl Birds Falco sparverius American Kestrel Birds Colinus virginianus Northern Bobwhite Birds Scolopax minor American Woodcock Birds Lanius ludovicianus migrans Migrant Loggerhead Shrike Birds Icteria virens Yellow-breasted Chat Birds Spizella pusilla Field Sparrow Birds Pooecetes gramineus Vesper Sparrow Birds Ammodramus savannarum Grasshopper Sparrow Birds Dolichonyx oryzivorus Bobolink Birds Sturnella magna Eastern Meadowlark Habitat Stresses and Conservation Actions The conversion of farmland for residential and commercial development reduces valuable habitat for wildlife, especially grassland birds. In addition, modern farming practices have resulted in the intensification of mechanized farming practices and the expansion of areas cleared for agriculture. Consequently, much natural vegetation providing wildlife habitat in grasslands, wetlands, fallow areas, riparian corridors, hedgerows, and forest edges has been cleared. The timing of agricultural practices also impacts some priority species. For example, early haying impacts ground nesting birds. Many SGCN also rely on habitat created by utility corridors, where the cutting of vegetation or herbicide treatment can have direct impacts on native birds and their nests. Rodenticides may also harm Barn Owls and other birds of prey. 52Developed and Agricultural Lands, and Biodiversity 53The table below lists the habitat stresses to priority species in agricultural and developed areas, and conservation actions to address them. Habitat Stresses and Actions in Agricultural and Developed Habitats Habitat Stress Conservation Action Land use planning, land protection, conservation Residential development easements Insufficient nest microhabitat Nest box installation and monitoring Reduce clean farming practices, maintain early Insufficient habitat, cover and predation successional forest Barn owl poisoning from rodenticides Outreach to landowners to reduce rodenticides Clean farming practices: loss of woody veg.

Likely changes include increasing temperatures, longer growing seasons, increasing number of hot days and nights, and changing precipitation patterns. Impacts include increases in the risk of damage to soil, crops, and infrastructure from extreme storm and precipitation events, flood damage, soil moisture stress and drought, competition from weeds and invasive plants, crop damage from insects and pathogens, and livestock parasites and pathogens. Butler et. al (2015) also noted that impervious surfaces in developed areas can exacerbate many of these impacts. Many wildlife species associated with agricultural and developed lands rely on grassland and pasture, fallow fields, floodplain and riparian corridors, streams and wetlands, and areas of natural vegetation around field and forest edges. In agricultural settings, these areas may already be degraded and sensitive to disturbance. As we have seen in previous sections of this plan, these areas may also be susceptible to impacts from climate change. Riparian forests may be vulnerable to climate change stressors including increased flood frequency and severity and resulting erosion and sedimentation in streams. Drought may stress streams and aquatic life, as well as plants, and increase their susceptibility to pests and pathogens. Warming temperatures and increased storm disturbances may enable non- native invasive plant species to outcompete native species. Janowiack et. al (2016) list numerous strategies to boost the resilience of agriculture to climate change, including maintaining soil health and water quality, reducing competition from weeds and invasive species, creating pollinator habitat, adapting farm infrastructure such as stream crossings to higher peak 54flows, adapting farm practices or shifting agricultural land use to match changing conditions. Managing farms as part of a larger landscape by maintaining, restoring and connecting natural habitats such as streams, wetlands, riparian areas and forest edges can boost the resilience of farms by buffering hydrological impacts while providing habitat and corridors wildlife to persist and adapt to climate change. In developed areas, limiting and buffering impervious surfaces, and using constructed wetlands and other green infrastructure can also reduce the hydrological impacts of climate change. Below is a summary of climate stresses on wildlife habitat in agricultural and developed areas, and actions to boost their resilience. Climate stresses are listed separately, but agricultural habitats are often impacted by a multiple climate stresses occurring simultaneously. Therefore, actions to boost habitat resilience are intended to address multiple climate stresses. These actions reinforce conservation actions to reduce stress on priority species in agricultural and developed habitats. WVDNR, partners and landowners can collaborate to select the habitat resilience actions best suited to site conditions, conservation goals and land management objectives. Climate Stresses and Resilience Actions for Agricultural and Developed Habitats Climate Stress: Habitat Resilience Action: • Increased flood frequency and severity, • Maintain soil health and water quality erosion, and sedimentation • Reduce competition from weeds and invasive • Increased surface water temperatures, species low-flow events, and water quality • Create pollinator habitat degradation • Maintain, restore, and connect aquatic, riparian • Increased risk of drought and wildfire and forest habitats to buffer against hydrological • Increased competition from non-native impacts invasive species, pests, and pathogens • Adapt farm practices, infrastructure and land uses to changing conditions • Reduce and buffer impervious surfaces, and use green infrastructure to absorb runoff and mitigate hydrological impacts 55Implementation Plan WVDNR will seek to engage the following partners and programs in implementing and measuring the effectiveness of conservation actions in agricultural habitats.

Benefits may include erosion control and improved water quality, improved hunting, fishing and recreational opportunities, and conservation of native pollinators for crop production. 57Landscape Resilience and Connectivity For the Cacapon River and Patterson Creek CFA, the SWAP included the following conservation action: • Implement a comprehensive plan to enhance climate change resiliency through reducing other stressors, identifying, maintaining, and creating key habitat cores and corridors, and protecting areas of high landscape complexity and integrity”. The conservation and resilience actions described previously in this action plan aim to reduce stressors on priority species in each major habitat type and enhance the resilience of those habitats to climate change. Some of those actions include protecting refugia, core areas of intact habitats and habitat corridors. Habitat cores are patches of high-quality habitat for priority species, surrounded by areas with a different community structure, and serve as nodes in a connected ecological network (Harrison and Odell, 2016; USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2004). Habitat cores identified for protection in this CFA include large forest blocks, wetlands, habitats limited to specific soil types and geology such as shale barrens, cliffs and talus, biologically significant caves and their buffer zones, and core aquatic habitat such as mussel streams and brook trout habitat patches. Important habitat corridors identified for protection include connected forest patches, intact river floodplains and small stream riparian forests. Protecting corridors of terrestrial and aquatic habitat connected to habitat patches and larger core areas may allow for species movement and enhance the flow of genetic material in response to climate change (Butler et. al, 2015; Anderson et. al, 2016a). But wildlife conservation in changing climate may require conservation actions at a landscape level, across habitat types, and beyond individual habitat cores and corridors. Anderson (2016b) summarized a wealth of current research demonstrating how the increasing frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and fires may cause species to respond by shifting location or behavior within their existing habitat, evolving to adapt to new conditions, or shifting their distributions across the landscape. Evidence has been documented for over 1000 species currently shifting one of four ways: locally toward suitable microclimate, upslope to higher elevations, downslope towards moist riparian areas, and northward toward cooler latitudes. However, landscape fragmentation has been shown to slow movement in response to climate change. Enabling wildlife to shift and adapt to climate change will require the conservation of a network of unfragmented landscapes within which species can shift their range to more suitable local microclimates or upslope, downslope or northward. In 2008 the WVDNR developed a model of landscape integrity to identify unfragmented landscapes. The map on the subsequent page illustrates areas of high landscape integrity in the CFA. Landscape integrity is estimated to increase with distance from roads, powerlines, development, and other features that fragment the landscape. These high integrity landscapes tend to correspond to larger forest patches and most lie within public lands including the George Washington National Forest along the east side of the CFA, as well as Lost River and Cacapon Resort State Parks, and Short Mountain WMA. There are also landscapes of high integrity in private ownership, notably south of Short Mountain WMA and along the Mineral – Hampshire county line east of Patterson Creek. These areas are important for species movement in response to climate change and are priorities for protection of wildlife habitat. 58Landscape Integrity 59Building on the concept of landscape integrity, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) led a team of 60 scientists to identify areas representing all geophysical settings, with varied microclimates and natural cover, that were most likely to sustain native plants and animals and natural processes into the future and be resilient to climate change. The team identified resilient sites as those with topographic and elevation diversity that offer a range of habitat types and microclimates for species and ecosystems to adapt to climate change, along with high landscape integrity or local connectedness where species could move locally and disperse in response to climate change, and where natural processes like fire and floods could continue unimpeded. These are core areas for species movement and adaptation at a local level. They then modeled the movement or flow of species across the landscape over time in response to climate change, and as constrained by natural and human-caused barriers. This led to the identification of corridors of constrained movement, and flow zones of dispersed movement. These are corridors and core areas for species movement and adaptation at a landscape level. Lastly the team developed models that integrated landscape resilience, connectivity and the flow of species and populations across the landscape to develop a connected network of sites that represents the full suite of geophysical settings, includes known records of biological diversity, and has the configuration and connections necessary to support the continued movement of species in response to change conditions. To identify the subset of places most essential for sustaining biodiversity in a changing climate and aligned to the natural flow patterns across the region, the team then identified the most resilient and diverse lands representing all of the region’s geophysical settings, recorded occurrences of biological diversity, resilient lands already secured through public ownership or conservation easements, and the riparian corridors and other landscape linkages with the most concentrated movement of species. This prioritized network covers 23% of the land in the Eastern United States. This work is documented in Resilient Sites for Terrestrial Conservation in Eastern North America (Anderson et al, 2016a), and Resilient and Connected Landscapes for Terrestrial Conservation (Anderson et al, 2016b). The studies produced a series of maps (see http://maps.tnc.org/resilientland/) that identified the following areas: • Resilient area: a place buffered from climate change because it contains diverse, complex, connected landscapes with many micro-climates that create options for species adapting to climate change. • Climate corridor: a narrow conduit of natural cover in which the movement of plants and animals becomes concentrated, often along a stream corridor or ridgeline. • Climate flow zone: areas with high levels of plant and animal movement that is less concentrated than in a corridor, such as an intact forest patches and areas of high integrity. On the following page, the regional map of priority resilient and connected landscapes illustrates that the resilient, connected landscapes of the CFA form a critical bridge between the large forest blocks, resilient landscapes and flow zones to the south and the narrower climate corridors along the ridges and valleys stretching northeast into Pennsylvania. The resilient, connected landscapes in this CFA are critical to the species adapting to climate change within the larger network across the Eastern United States. 60Prioritized Resilient and Connected Network: Regional View 61On the next page is a more detailed view of the priority resilient, connected network of landscapes within the Cacapon River and Patterson Creek CFA, which includes many resilient lands, flow zones and corridors with confirmed biodiversity. On the eastern half of the Cacapon portion of the CFA there is a network of climate corridors, resilient areas and flow zones stretching from the state boundary on the Great North Mountain and Cove Mountain in the south, then north along the ridges on the east side of the North River, to the ridges around the Cacapon River. Other connected blocks of resilient land occur on the west side of the Cacapon watershed from Shenandoah and Branch Mountains in the south, up to around Spring Gap Mountain and Sideling Hill in the north. The Patterson Creek portion of the CFA also includes several blocks of resilient lands and connected landscapes, including the lands along Patterson Creek Mountain on the east, from Knobly Mountain in the Southwest north to Stagg Run, and the area toward the confluence of Patterson Creek and the North Branch at the Maryland State line. These priority resilient and connected landscapes contain the CFA’s large forest patches and high integrity areas, and most of the CFA’s rock outcrop, cliff and talus, and shale barren habitats, cave and karst features, and known biodiversity. Smaller patches of fragmented forest and agricultural areas are not included. Protecting and maintaining these areas of high landscape integrity and the resilient areas, climate corridors and climate flow zones within the region’s priority resilient and connected network is critical in order to enable priority SGCN and their habitat to adapt to climate change and persist in this CFA. These areas are priorities for conservation action within the CFA. The table below summarizes conservation actions for climate resilience to address stresses from climate change at a landscape level. Climate Stresses and Actions for Landscape Resilience and Connectivity Climate Stress Conservation Action • Changing conditions exacerbating existing stresses on species and habitat • Protect and maintain a connected network of • Species responding to climate change by resilient landscapes, flow zones and climate shifting locally as well as across the corridors across the landscape for species to landscape adapt and shift locally and regionally in response • Landscape fragmentation that prevents or to climate change constrains species movement 62Prioritized Resilient & Connect Network: Detailed View 63Implementation Plan The resilient and connected landscapes in this CFA provide critical links to the larger network of resilient and connected landscapes in West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, the Central Appalachians, and Eastern North America. They provide a blueprint of habitat cores and corridors where conservation actions to restore, maintain and protect natural habitat and remove barriers to movement will be crucial to enabling priority species and habitats to shift and adapt to climate change at both local and regional scales. The following implementation plan lists specific actions to protect, maintain and restore the network of resilient, connected lands within the CFA.

The major habitat types include forests and woodlands, barrens, cliffs and talus, caves and karst, aquatic, riparian and floodplain habitats, and developed and agricultural habitats. For each major habitat type the plan identifies stresses that affect priority species, conservation actions to reduce those stresses, climate stresses on those habitats and actions to boost resilience, partners that can assist with conservation actions to implement the plan, and the human benefits of conservation. Below is a list of the priority habitats identified by this Action Plan for conservation action within each major habitat type. • Large, intact forest patches, including interior forest habitat • Early successional forest habitat • Small areas of unique, geologically derived habitat including: o Acidic rock outcrops, cliffs and talus o Calcareous cliffs and talus o Shale barrens • Areas with karst geology and caves, and their watersheds • Buffer areas surrounding biologically significant caves • Special aquatic habitats, such as mussel streams, brook trout habitat patches and wetlands • Small stream riparian and river floodplain habitats • Riparian corridors, wetlands, fallow fields, field borders and other areas of natural and woody vegetation within and around agricultural lands. These priority habitats include habitat cores and corridors that are critical for maintaining wildlife populations in this CFA. To protect priority SGCN and enable them to adapt to changing conditions within these priority habitats, landowners and partner organizations are encouraged to plan and implement conservation actions to alleviate stresses on priority species and boost habitat resilience, and carefully monitor the results using an adaptive management framework such as the Climate Smart Conservation Cycle included in the introduction. Stakeholders are also encouraged to coordinate with relevant agencies to develop strategies to avoid, minimize and mitigate for impacts to these priority habitats. Integration of Conservation Actions Integration of conservation actions within the above priority habitats, such as projects to improve mussel stream habitat by improving wastewater treatment, enlarging stream crossings and plant riparian stream buffers may benefit multiple plant communities and wildlife species. Coordinating actions across multiple habitats, such as protecting large patches of diverse forest habitats that also include rare shale barrens, rock outcrops or cliff and talus habitats, or improving water quality and 65planting riparian corridors in karst landscapes or cave watersheds, may benefit additional species. Private landowners, public land managers and conservation partners are encouraged to focus resources across habitats to maximize benefits to multiple species in areas targeted for action in ways. Connecting Conservation Actions for Climate Resilience As we have seen, conservation actions to relieve stresses on priority species and efforts to boost the resilience of wildlife habitat are essential for enabling climate adaptation. Maintaining and protecting areas of high landscape integrity as well as the regional network of resilient lands, climate corridors, and flow zones is also critical for enabling wildlife species to adapt to changing conditions and shift across the landscape. Furthermore, creating local networks of connected habitat cores and corridors will enhance their resilience and connectivity, and the ability of wildlife species to adapt to changing conditions within this CFA. Connected local networks of headwater streams and larger rivers, their riparian corridors, floodplains, and wetlands enhances the stability of these habitats and enables fish, reptiles, birds, and other priority wildlife species that depend on those habitats to move across the landscape as conditions change. Maintaining connections between patches of diverse forest habitat and with rare shale barrens, rock outcrops, cliff and talus, karst or cave habitat buffers enhances the resilience of these habitats and enables forest species to move to optimal sites as conditions change. Conservation of aquatic, riparian and floodplain corridors along with areas of native vegetation in and around agricultural areas, small forest patches and larger blocks of forest habitat can create a local network of resilient, connected lands that merges into the larger regional network. Beyond undertaking conservation actions in the priority habitats listed above, and even beyond protecting the regional network of climate connectors and flow zones, stakeholders are encouraged to restore and protect the connections between these areas in order to maintain an interwoven fabric of natural systems for wildlife within this CFA to thrive long into the future. Next Steps in Implementation WVDNR engaged a working group of partner organizations and public land managers in developing this Action Plan and will seek to remain engaged by convening semi-annual meetings with the working group to collaborate on actions including the following: • Planning, implementing, and evaluating ongoing field surveys of priority species to document and monitor their abundance, distribution, population trends, vulnerability, and range shifts • Planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the results of the conservation actions; and • Engaging and supporting private landowners in this work WVDNR may lead some of these efforts but will most often play the role of supporting efforts by the many partners active in this CFA with ongoing projects, established programs, and connections with landowners. In the case of public lands, WVDNR will also seek to incorporate conservation actions targeting priority species, habitats, and priority areas for conservation action into agency planning processes and support those actions. WVDNR will also work with state agencies and other authorities to promote avoidance, minimization, and mitigation for development impacts to priority habitats and other priority areas for conservation action. 66References Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. 2011.

        "Executive Summary In 2015 the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR) completed the State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP) with the input of numerous stakeholders from across the state, including public agencies and land managers, researchers, local and regional conservation organizations, volunteer groups, private landowners and members of the public. The 2015 SWAP identified 21 Conservation Focus Areas (CFAs), each with a distinctive set of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), wildlife habitats, stresses that can adversely affect those species, and conservation opportunities to address those stresses. In 2018 the WVDNR and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) began convening a working group of local stakeholders including public agencies and land managers, watershed groups, cave interest groups and other non-profit conservation organizations working in the area to develop this Action Plan for the North Fork Mountain- Thorn Creek CFA. This Action Plan addresses the eight essential elements required in the SWAP. It provides an overview of the landscape and major habitat types within this CFA, including forest and woodland habitats, rock outcrop, cliffs and talus and shale barren habitats, aquatic, floodplain and riparian habitats, karst and cave habitats, and developed and agricultural habitats. It also identifies 240 plant and animal SGCN that are priorities for conservation within this CFA based on factors such as their abundance, distribution, population trends and opportunities for conservation. For each major habitat type the Action Plan lists the priority species, stresses, and voluntary actions that can be taken by private landowners, public land managers and partner organizations for the conservation of wildlife species and their habitats. Climate stresses impacting each major habitat type and potential actions to boost their resilience are also listed. A plan for implementation for each major habitat type lists partners and programs available to assist with each of the actions and metrics for monitoring conservation success. There is also a summary of other human benefits that may be generated by the proposed conservation actions in each major habitat type. The Action Plan also describes a regional network of resilient and connected landscapes within which wildlife species can adapt and shift to a changing climate, identifies high integrity as well as resilient and connected landscapes within the CFA, and provides an implementation plan for landscape resilience and connectivity. The plan concludes with a summary of the priority habitats for conservation, describes the importance of combining conservation actions for greater impact and connecting them across the landscape for climate resilience, and outlines next steps in plan implementation. Local stakeholders can use this plan to identify priority species, the habitats and stresses within the CFA, as well as partners who can assist with planning, implementation and monitoring of conservation actions to conserve wildlife and enable climate adaptation. The information in this plan can also be used to inform conservation projects being planned by partners and provide justification for grant applications and other proposals seeking to conserve priority species and habitats. Local stakeholders can also work with relevant agencies to develop strategies to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts to priority species, their habitats, and the resilient and connected landscapes within this CFA. Conserving wildlife species and their habitat within this CFA will rely upon the voluntary actions of local landowners, public agencies and partner organizations, with support from the WVDNR. WVDNR will convene a working group of local stakeholders on a regular basis to provide guidance, assistance and support the plan, implement, and monitor conservation actions, facilitate stakeholder collaboration, and update the Action Plan every 10 years or sooner if needed. 1",
        "Introduction to the State Wildlife Action Plan & Conservation Focus Areas The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR) manages the state’s wildlife resources as part of the public trust. A goal of the WVDNR is to support and promote a sense of ownership in the conservation community and the public for the unique habitats and wildlife resources in West Virginia. The 2015 West Virginia State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP) was therefore developed to also function as a blueprint for conservation that other natural resource agencies, local governments, non-governmental organizations, and the general public can use and apply (WVDNR 2015). The SWAP is intended to have a ten-year timeframe and to be updated by 2025. Species of Greatest Conservation Need, Habitats and Stresses The 2015 SWAP identified 681 wildlife Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) across the state. Because plants are a fundamental element of habitat for wildlife SGCN, a list of SGCN plants was also developed, including 482 plant species. The SWAP classified and mapped nineteen terrestrial habitats across the state. These include 16 natural or semi-natural habitats that are derived from NatureServe’s Ecological Systems (Comer et al. 2003, Gawler 2008) and three anthropogenic habitats that represent map classes of the National Land Cover Database (Homer et al. 2004). In addition, the SWAP classified and mapped eighteen aquatic habitat types. These are GIS-derived types based on a simplification for West Virginia of the Northeast Aquatic Habitat Classification System (Anderson et al. 2013). Stream size is considered the most influential effect on determining biological assemblages at the reach scale and is divided into four primary classes: headwaters and creeks, small rivers, medium rivers, and large rivers. Stream slope, or gradient, affects aquatic communities at the reach scale due to its influence on stream bed morphology, water velocity, and sediment dynamics. Three relative classes (low, moderate, high) of gradient are used to define West Virginia’s streams. Water temperature in streams is a key physiological characteristic determining where different stream organisms may persist. Temperature affects seasonal migrations, growth rates, body condition, and fecundity of biota. Three temperature classes (cold, cool, warm) based on continuously recorded data and modeled environmental variables were used to determine biological constraints on stream communities in this model. The characteristics, distribution, trends, and threats associated with each of the terrestrial and aquatic habitats are described in the 2015 SWAP. This Conservation Focus Area Action Plan uses those same habitat classifications. For those SGCN listed in the SWAP and their associated habitats, WVDNR staff developed a statewide stress assessment using the classification system of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Terrestrial stresses were addressed at the habitat level within ecoregions. Aquatic stresses were addressed at the HUC 8 watershed level within ecoregions. The resulting analysis identified 21 major statewide stresses affecting terrestrial SGCN and habitats and 20 major stresses that affect aquatic SGCN and habitats. Stresses exerted on SGCN populations and habitats can reduce species populations either directly, by disease, or indirectly, by affecting the quality or quantity of available habitat. Conservation Actions The purpose of stress assessment and prioritization in the 2015 SWAP was to identify statewide conservation actions that could reduce stress on SGCN populations and their habitats. Most stresses are the result of the lawful activities of people, corporations, and public agencies. Rather than seeking a 2",
        "regulatory approach to restrict lawful activities, the intention of the SWAP was to promote voluntary collaboration with landowners, corporations, and other partner organizations and agencies to reduce stresses on wildlife species and their habitats. Conservation actions vary according to the species and the specific stresses being addressed and can take many forms. A lack of information on the status of a species or understanding of a threat may indicate a need for actions such as baseline inventory, research, or data acquisition. Direct action may involve directly protecting or restoring habitats. Conservation easements are a form of habitat protection that preserves habitat in its current state or can include land management plans that benefit wildlife. It is likely that a suite of actions is required, depending on the identified stress and the conservation opportunities available. Ideally, actions are designed to address the source of the stress (AFWA 2011). Conservation actions must also address habitat integrity and ecosystem processes. This includes conserving or preserving intact and functional habitats, protecting, or restoring aquatic resources, and maintaining and restoring connectivity between habitats (AFWA 2012, Byers and Norris, 2011). Conservation Focus Areas and Action Plans The SWAP provides a broad framework for conservation across West Virginia. However, wildlife species are concentrated in different parts of the state, and exposed to multiple, and often similar, stresses at state, regional, and local scales. Conservation Focus Areas (CFAs) are specific regions in the state where SGCNs are concentrated, addressable threats are identified, and where feasible opportunities exist for focused actions that will achieve success. In completing the 2015 SWAP, WVDNR defined 21 CFAs across the state based on these factors. The map on the following page illustrates the CFAs in West Virginia. In addition to conservation actions at the statewide level, the 2015 SWAP envisioned that planning at the CFA level would be necessary to fully implement successful conservation, and to further define conservation actions and measurable outcomes for most SWAP-based activities. The SWAP also noted that investing conservation resources in the CFAs could increase the potential for collaboration with partners and landowners, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of conservation on the ground. CFA Action Plans have been developed to identify priority SGCN from each taxa group in each major habitat type, key stresses and actions that will effectively secure or protect priority species and their habitats within the CFA. The Action Plans also identify public lands that can provide opportunities for conservation in collaboration with public land managers. And because many SGCN and their habitats occur on private property within CFAs, conservation actions will require collaboration with private landowners, as well as partner organizations and stakeholder groups. Many local partners have relations with landowners as well as the expertise, capacity, resources, and funding to plan and implement the actions listed in CFA Action Plans. CFA planning engages local partners and stakeholders at a scale where collaboration can increase resources (funding, capacity) available for conservation action. WVDNR has engaged a working group of local partners in developing each CFA Action Plan and intends to facilitate, guide and support partner efforts in planning, implementation, and evaluation of conservation actions to implement the plans. 3",
        "Conservation Focus Areas in West Virginia. Climate Change and Resilience The 2015 SWAP listed climate change as a substantial threat to wildlife and plant populations, noting several recent studies. For example, an assessment of the relative vulnerability to climate change of 185 animal and plant species in West Virginia (Byers and Norris, 2011) identified natural and anthropogenic barriers to movement and dispersal, and physiological thermal and hydrological niches occupied by some species as risk factors correlated with vulnerability to climate change. Over half of the species assessed were determined to be vulnerable to climate change. This study and the SWAP identified climate change as a stressor particularly for cool and coldwater fish, mollusks, plants, terrestrial salamanders, and many species associated with wetlands and high elevation ecosystems. The SWAP listed habitat shifts and alterations as statewide stresses for terrestrial SGCN and it listed increasing frequency and severity of drought, storms and flooding and temperature extremes as statewide stresses for aquatic SGCN and habitats. The SWAP observed that even within taxonomic and habitat groupings, species may respond differently to climate change based on their sensitivity to factors such as temperature, moisture, and seasonal triggers. Furthermore, climate change acts in tandem with other stresses on wildlife and habitat, and actions to address those other stresses could decrease their vulnerability to climate change. And actions to address climate impacts would vary between CFAs, emphasizing restoration and expansion of vulnerable habitat types in some areas, or reducing habitat fragmentation in others. The SWAP further 4",
        "stated that efficient approaches to maintaining broad suites of species include maintaining functioning ecological systems, landscapes that are resilient to the effects of climate change, and ecological connectivity within and between landscapes. Rather than a species-specific approach, the SWAP therefore sought to address climate change broadly through additional vulnerability assessments for select species, statewide actions to reduce additional stresses on SGCN and their habitats, and more geographically focused actions in Conservation Focus Areas (CFAs). CFAs are an appropriate scale to promote climate resilience by identifying local actions to relieve stresses on SGCN, restore or expand vulnerably habitats, and maintain ecosystems process, landscape resilience and connectivity. Monitoring and Adaptive Management Monitoring of SGCN and their habitat is essential to establish better baseline data about species distribution, abundance, and population trends. The SWAP envisioned monitoring of species and habitat trends across the state, along with more intensive monitoring within CFAs through collaboration with local partners to gain more area-specific data and to address local threats with targeted conservation actions. Beyond monitoring SGCN and their habitat, successful wildlife conservation in CFAs will require monitoring the effectiveness of conservation actions and adapting those actions accordingly. The SWAP envisioned monitoring the results of conservation actions at the CFA level, and that CFA-level plans would incorporate measurement and monitoring protocols integrated with conservation actions themselves. Effectiveness measures indicate progress to date and whether the expected results are being realized. Conservation actions should be designed with enough specificity that project impacts and performance can be measured but broadly enough to benefit multiple species and engage partners. Success may be measured by the amount of protected or restored habitat, by stable or increasing populations, or by acquiring a more complete understanding of species and threats in order to make informed conservation decisions. Another measure of success is the amount of “buy-in” or participation by conservation partners in the public and private sectors. Conservation partners, especially those operating through grant funding or those following conservation agency protocols, may already have metrics for accomplishment/success that are used for their own reporting requirements. Furthermore, accountability and transparency to funding sources, partners, and the public are essential for program success. Adaptive management also requires monitoring of climate change impacts on species, their habitats, and the success of conservation actions. Conservation actions are intended to reduce stresses on SGCN and their habitats, and to enable species to adapt to changing conditions. In common terms, climate adaptation may be thought of as preparing for, coping with, or adjusting to climatic changes and their associated impacts (Stein et al. 2014). Planning conservation actions for climate adaptation will require consideration of climate impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation options, and careful monitoring of project effectiveness and ecological response. Frameworks such as the Climate Smart Conservation Cycle illustrated below (from Stein et. al, 2014) can be used to plan, implement, and monitor conservation actions to enable wildlife to adapt to a changing climate. Planning and monitoring conservation actions may be informed by the climate impacts to species and habitats, WVDNR’s ongoing vulnerability assessments and field surveys to further document the distribution, abundance, and population trends of priority species, and the options to build the resilience of each major habitat type listed in this Action Plan. Information on site conditions and project plans provided by partners and landowners should also be considered. This will require careful coordination among WVDNR and local stakeholders. 5",
        "Organization of this Action Plan This CFA Action Plan will begin by introducing the CFA, including an overview of the landscape, terrestrial and aquatic habitats, species of greatest conservation need, distinctive stresses and broad conservation actions, potential partners and lands protected by public ownership or conservation easements. The Action Plan then reviews the conservation goals and lists priority species identified by WVDNR specialists based on factors such as their abundance, population trends and opportunities for conservation within the CFA. The Action Plan is then divided by major habitat type, including forest and woodland habitats, rock outcrop, cliffs and talus and shale barren habitats, aquatic, floodplain and riparian habitats, karst and cave habitats, and developed and agricultural habitats. For each major habitat type the Action Plan lists priority species, stresses effecting those species, and actions to alleviate those stresses. The Action Plan also identifies climate stresses impacting each major habitat type and lists potential actions to boost their resilience. The Action Plan provides a plan for implementation and monitoring of conservation actions for each major habitat type, and a brief statement about other human benefits that may be generated by the proposed actions. The Action Plan also describes a regional network of resilient and connected landscapes spanning multiple habitat types to enable wildlife species to adapt and shift to a changing climate and provides an implementation plan for landscape resilience and connectivity. The conclusion provides a summary of the priority habitats for conservation, describes the importance of integrating conservation actions for greater impact and connecting conservation actions for climate resilience, and outlines next steps in plan implementation. 6",
        "How to use this plan Implementation of this plan will rely upon voluntary actions by local stakeholders including landowners, public agencies and partner organizations, and collaboration between them to conserve wildlife species and their habitat. The role of WVDNR in implementing this Action Plan is to provide local stakeholders with information, guidance, assistance, and support to plan, implement, and monitor conservation actions, and facilitate stakeholder collaboration. Local stakeholders can use this plan for many purposes, including the following: • Identify priority wildlife species, rare plant communities and their habitats, and the resilient and connected landscapes that can enable species to shift in response to changing conditions. • Work with relevant agencies to develop strategies to avoid, minimize and mitigate for impacts to priority species, their habitats, and the resilient and connected landscapes. • Identify stresses on priority species in specific habitats, conservation actions that can alleviate those stresses, monitoring protocols to evaluate success, and partners who can provide assistance. • Understand climate impacts on wildlife habitat, and actions to boost habitat resilience. • Plan and implement conservation actions to alleviate stresses on wildlife species in specific habitat, boost habitat resilience, and enable wildlife to adapt to climate change. • Design and implement monitoring protocol to evaluate the success of conservation actions. • Inform and provide rationale for activities being proposed in grant or permit applications. • Integrate priority species, habitat, and climate resilience into other local project plans. The information provided in this Action Plan is constantly evolving. Local stakeholders are encouraged to seek additional information and assistance from WVDNR to: • Confirm whether specific priority wildlife species and habitats are present at specific sites • Understand their vulnerability to climate change • Further define or confirm stresses on wildlife species and habitats • Tailor proposed wildlife conservation actions to alleviate stresses • Consider adaptation options to boost habitat resilience to climate change • Develop effective strategies to monitor and evaluate project success 7",
        "The Cacapon River and Patterson Creek Conservation Focus Area Overview The Ridge and Valley Ecoregion includes the entire watersheds of the Cacapon River and Patterson Creek. The Cacapon watershed includes two large tributary drainages, the North River and Lost River. Both watersheds are in the Potomac Basin and have many ecological and land-use similarities. A map of the CFA is on the following page. The valleys in both the Cacapon and Patterson Creek watersheds are below 1000 feet in elevation & have narrow, but well-developed floodplains along the larger streams. The shale uplands give way to parallel ridges of mostly shale and sandstone. Areas of limestone occur in both watersheds. Higher mountains, some rising above 3000 feet, include: ` • Cacapon Mountain • Patterson Creek Mountain • Great North Mountain • Knobly Mountain • Short Mountain • Allegheny Mountain (the Allegheny Front) • Long Mountain The ridgetops and upper slopes in this CFA are mostly forested, with several medium and large intact forest areas or “blocks” remaining primarily in the Cacapon Watershed. Privately owned forestland is mostly in small to medium sized tracts and used for forestry and recreation. Some of the lower ridges support apple orchards, while lower uplands & river bottoms are mostly used for agriculture. Agriculture practices are primarily livestock production and include pasture and hay lands and corn production. Poultry operations also occur in both watersheds. Residential development is prevalent in the Cacapon Watershed, especially along the Cacapon River downstream of North River and adjacent to public land. Small towns in the Cacapon watershed include Wardensville and Capon Bridge. There is substantial public land in the eastern portion of the Cacapon Watershed, including the George Washington National Forest, Cacapon State Park, Sideling Hill Wildlife Management Area, and Short Mountain Wildlife Management Area. Lost River State Park lies in the southwest portion of the watershed. Communities and towns present in the Patterson Creek watershed include Williamsport, Burlington, and Fort Ashby. There are no state or federal lands in the Patterson Creek watershed. 8",

Headwater tributaries in both Cacapon River and Patterson Creek, although at low elevations, are cold water streams that support native Brook Trout populations. Streams and wetlands in the CFA support 28 dragonflies and damselflies SGCN (an unusually large number for West Virginia). These watersheds also include shale barrens that support associated endemic plants and lepidopterans including 14 SGCN moths and butterflies. This is also an important CFA for birds, including 44 SGCN. Pastures and hayfields are important for several grassland bird species. Upland forests, especially larger intact forest blocks on the national forest, support a suite of forest interior bird species. Altogether, the CFA supports 75 SGCN plants. The algific talus community (which holds subsurface ice into the summer) at Ice Mountain is a notable refugium for rare plants and snails, and the extensive, high quality wetlands on Short Mountain WMA are of global significance. This Action Plan will list the priority SGCN in each major habitat type in the CFA. 14",
        "Distinctive Stresses The 2015 SWAP lists several general stresses affecting SGCN and habitat in this CFA: • Development pressure is significant in the Cacapon Watershed, with substantial residential and second home development, especially along major streams and adjacent to public land. • Water quality impacts from agriculture and development exist throughout both watersheds. • Fragmenting intact forests increases surface water temperatures (and consequently headwater stream temperatures) and storm water run-off. In addition to this list of general stresses, this Action Plan will list more specific local stresses affecting priority SGCN in each major habitat type. Conservation Actions To address these stresses, the 2015 SWAP recommended that four main types of action in the CFA: 1. Promote practices for restoring riparian habitat, including streamside fencing and establishing riparian buffers, and for reducing sedimentation and nutrient runoff from farms. 2. Coordinate with the active land trust and farmland protection community to protect habitat through land conservation. 3. Engage public landowners to maintain large, intact forest blocks thus protecting many other special habitats. Develop forest management plans. 4. Implement a plan to enhance climate change resiliency through reducing other stressors (such as invasive species), identifying, maintaining, and creating key habitat cores and corridors, and protecting areas of high landscape complexity and integrity. These four broad actions are integrated into this Action Plan along with more specific conservation actions to address the stresses affecting priority SGCN in each major habitat type. Potential Partners The 2015 SWAP lists many potential partners for landowners and others interested in wildlife conservation in the CFA, including: • WV Division of Forestry, • County Farmland Protection Boards, • WV Department of Environmental • The Cacapon and Lost Rivers Land Trust, Protection, • Friends of the Cacapon, • USDA- Natural Resource Conservation • The Cacapon Institute, and Service, • Potomac Conservancy. • West Virginia Conservation Agency, With an established “constituency”, many conservation partners can provide direct outreach to landowners and key stakeholders interested in wildlife conservation. The WVDNR will engage with these and other partners in regular meetings and planning workshops during CFA planning, 15",
        "implementing conservation actions, and monitoring effectiveness. In many cases partners may assume a lead role in implementation. Appendix 1 lists the types of programming and assistance each partner provides to landowners. Specific partners are also listed along with conservation actions supported through their programs in the implementation plan for each habitat type. Protected Lands Public lands that can provide significant opportunities for wildlife conservation include: • George Washington National Forest • Short Mountain, Edwards Run, Nathaniel • Cacapon and Lost River State Parks Mountain, and Sideling Hill WMAs These public lands provide important wildlife habitat and are managed for conservation or other compatible goals. Appendix 3 lists habitat types occurring in each of the public lands within this CFA. WVDNR will work with public land managers to identify opportunities to plan and implement conservation actions that address stresses in these habitats and support priority SGCN. WVDNR will work with public land managers to identify opportunities to plan and implement conservation actions that address stresses in these habitats and support priority SGCN. On state lands, this may include protection of important ecosystems, habitats, SGCN populations or plant communities through designation as State Natural Areas. City and county-owned public lands may also be managed to benefit wildlife and habitat. In addition, land trusts and conservation organizations including the Cacapon and Lost River Land Trust and the Potomac Conservancy, as well as The Nature Conservancy, the county farmland protection boards, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and WV Division of Forestry’s Forest Legacy Program hold conservation easements on private lands that may protect important wildlife habitat and provide additional wildlife conservation opportunities. The next map shows the location of public lands and conservation easements in the CFA, based on data provided by The Conservation Fund (TCF), USGS Gap Analysis Program (GAP), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED) in 2015. It also shows known occurrences of SGCN and rare plant communities within 500- square meter areas, and the biodiversity rank (including global, state, or local significance) of those occurrences, as generated by WVDNR in 2017. This map illustrates that many SGCN and rare plant communities occur on public lands and conservation easements in the CFA, and there may be opportunities for WVDNR, public agencies and landowners to protect them there. Many SGCN and rare plant communicates also occur on private land outside of public lands and conservation easements. This indicates how important it is for WVDNR and other partners to work with private landowners to restore and protect biodiversity on private lands.

        "Action Plan for the Conservation Focus Area Conservation Goals The Cacapon River/Patterson Creek CFA Action Plan is an extension of the State Wildlife Action Plan. While it is driven by local issues, the overarching goals remain the same. These include: 1.

Keep the common species common 4. Conserve the full array of habitat types and biological diversity in the state The WVDNR will develop relationships with conservation partners and key stakeholders to support and promote natural resource stewardship and guide efforts that protect, restore, enhance, and otherwise benefit natural communities and processes. Only through collaboration with agency partners, non- governmental organizations and the public can we address threats to Species of Greatest Conservation Need, key habitats, and unique communities. Priority Species Effectiveness and efficiency are paramount in targeting actions in CFAs and specifically addressing every SGCN present in the CFA is not feasible. From the list of SGCN present in the CFA provided in the SWAP, WVDNR wildlife biologists selected priority species for conservation action that represent the best opportunity for successful conservation based on its population status and known trends in the CFA, the significance of each species at the global, state and local levels, the degree of dependence of each species on habitats within the CFA, conservation opportunities and likelihood of conservation success in the CFA, and other factors. The table below lists SGCN that were selected as priority species within the CFA based on the above criteria. Also listed are the priority species which are classified as rare, threatened or endangered species or as sensitive species by United States Forest Service’s Region 8 and as at risk species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, indicating that the agencies may target these species for conservation action and may provide additional technical and financial support. Additional field surveying and information is needed to document and monitor the distribution, abundance, and population trends of these priority species in the habitats where they occur, and to assess their vulnerability to climate change. This work is ongoing and will be included as an action in the implementation plan for each major habitat type that follows.

        "Forest and Woodland Habitats Dry Mesic Oak Forests cover about one half of the CFA and represent the largest portion of forest habitat types, followed by Dry Oak Pine Forests. Dry Calcareous Forests, Woodlands and Glades and Pine-Oak Rocky Woodlands occupy smaller portions of the CFA but represent over 15% of those forest habitat types in the state. Smaller portions of forested areas are composed of Mixed Mesophytic Forests, Montane Red Oak Forests on some high ridge tops, and Northern Hardwood Forests. The following pages include maps of forest habitat types, and intact forest patches (based on the Appalachian and Mid-Atlantic Forest Patch Dataset compiled by The Nature Conservancy in 2011) with biodiversity. The diversity of forest types across elevational gradients provides great opportunities for their conservation within larger forest patches and requires careful management tied to specific site conditions and forest stand characteristics. Intact forest patches provide core habitat for a significant portion of the SGCN and rare communities, as well as a matrix of forest habitat types and large corridors within which forest species may shift and adapt to climate change. Priority Species The table below lists priority species in the CFA associated with forest and woodland habitats. Priority Species in Forest and Woodland Habitats.

Large forest patches provide core habitat for forest interior breeding birds, including Broad-winged Hawk, Wood Thrush, Cerulean Warbler and Worm-eating Warbler. Early successional habitats support Prairie Warbler, and Black-billed Cuckoo. Wood turtles rely on forested as well as aquatic habitats for different parts of their life history.

Note that over half of the state’s Eastern Ridges Oak-Hickory-Graminoid Forest are located here. These communities are vulnerable to disturbance by logging and grazing activities, and to the spread of non-native invasive plants.

While efforts to manage and restore both early successional and interior forest habitat are needed for priority SGCN, restoration efforts should not convert one to the other. Early successional forest habitat forest restoration should take place in small patches of forest and along forest edges. Existing young forests can be enhanced outside of large blocks of interior forest. And efforts to restore and expand interior forest blocks should not generate an overall loss of early successional forest. Climate Change and Habitat Resilience The Central Appalachian Forest Ecosystem Vulnerability Assessment (Butler et. al, 2015) described many potential impacts of climate change on forests in the region. Likely impacts include increased temperatures (especially during the summer and fall), a decrease in winter snowpack, longer growing seasons, increased precipitation during spring and even greater decreases in precipitation during summer and fall, more frequent heavy precipitation events, and increasing frequency and severity of storms. These impacts will likely lead to changing soil moisture patterns, increased risk of wildfire, increased damage from pests and pathogens, and increased extent and abundance of invasive plants. Habitat for northern species is likely to decline, although species such as red spruce may persist in cool, wet microclimates. Tree seedlings will likely be more vulnerable to climate change impacts than mature trees. Forest ecosystems lacking a diversity of species, age classes and genotypes may be at greater risk from climate change than those with greater diversity. Forest species in fragmented landscapes will have less opportunity to migrate across the landscape in response to changing conditions, and ecological communities tied to specific hydrological conditions or geologic features may also be unable to migrate. Urban areas and impervious cover can exacerbate the effects of increasing temperatures and heavier precipitation. However, ecosystems within areas of high landscape complexity, including a diversity of topography and microhabitats, may be more able to persist and adapt in response to climate change. The 2015 assessment also described likely impacts to specific forest types. Dry Mesic Oak Forests support of large number of tree species over a diversity of terrain, and many of the tree species are tolerant of drought and fire, providing some resilience to climate change. Fire suppression and timber harvesting have allowed more mesic species to become dominant. But increased temperature and drought could increase the risk of wildfire. While low-intensity fires could restore fire-adapted species, severe fires, combined with drought and other stressors, could increase mortality of some species. Higher temperatures and drought may increase the susceptibility of these forests to invasive species, pests and pathogens, and drought as well as disturbances from stronger storms may enable the spread of non-native invasive plants. 25",
        "Dry Oak Pine Forests and Pine-Oak Rocky Woodlands are adapted to heat, drought and fire. While moderate increases in these drivers could benefit this forest type, severe drought and fire could lead to increased mortality of tree species. Droughts may increase susceptibility to forest pests and pathogens and enable non-native invasive plants to outcompete native herbs and shrubs, providing additional fuel for fires and increasing fire intensity. Forest pests, pathogens and invasive plants need to be carefully managed to build resilience to climate change. Dry Calcareous Forests, Woodlands and Glades are adapted to heat, drought and wildfire, but may be impacted by increased fire intensity, correlated with increases in invasive plant species. Management of invasive plants will be critical for the long-term resilience of the ecosystem. Dependence on unique soils may impede the ecosystem’s ability to shift across the landscape. Mixed Mesophytic Forests may be vulnerable to increasing disturbance by wildfire, drought and invasion by non-native plants. These ecosystems may decline in some areas, while sheltered sites in areas of complex topography may provide some refuge from climate change. Drought may increase the susceptibility of these forests to hemlock woolly adelgid, forest tent caterpillar, beech bark disease and other insect pests and diseases. Invasive plants may outcompete native species as conditions change, and drought may increase the risk of wildfire, to which these forests are not well adapted. The small areas of northern hardwood forests may be particularly impacted by climate change. Increased heat and moisture stress in summer and fall may interact with acid deposition as well as increases in insect pests and pathogens, storm disturbance and wildfires to stress these forests, reducing species diversity and coverage. Cool, moist sites within areas of complex topography may provide some refuge and buffer the effects of climate change. Some changes in forest composition and structure are likely to occur over time as these different forest types adapt and adjust in response to changes in climate. Conservation actions to reduce existing stresses on forests will aid in building their resilience. Protection of large forest patches in areas with complex topography and diverse microclimates, and maintaining forested connections between them, may further enable their adaptation and shifting distribution across the landscape. Below is a summary of climate stresses on forest habitats, and actions which could boost their resilience (Swanston et al, 2016). While climate stresses are listed separately, forest and woodland habitats are often impacted by a multiple climate stresses occurring simultaneously and actions to boost habitat resilience are intended to address multiple climate stresses. Many of these actions resemble previously listed conservation actions to reduce stress on priority species, meaning that they could have positive outcomes for priority species as well as habitat resilience. WVDNR, land managers, landowners and partners may select the actions best suited to their specific site conditions, management goals and objectives, from the list below or other sources. 26",

        "Climate Change and Habitat Resilience As described in The Central Appalachians Forest Ecosystem Vulnerability Assessment (Butler et. al, 2015), ecosystems that are limited by geological features may be restricted from shifting across the landscape in response to climate change. Acidic rock outcrops, cliffs and talus and shale barren habitats are dependent on underlying geology, so their ability to shift across the landscape in response to climate change is very limited. While they are usually adapted to extreme conditions, they may be vulnerable to increased disturbance from drought, fire and storms, and from invasion by non-native invasive plants.

        "Aquatic, Floodplain and Riparian Habitats A diversity of aquatic habitats in the CFA range from cold, high-gradient headwater streams to warm, low gradient, medium sized rivers such as the lower sections of Cacapon River and Patterson Creek. A map of aquatic habitat types is included in the introduction to the CFA. These streams and river habitats are tightly connected with their adjacent floodplains, wetlands and riparian habitats. Many wildlife species rely on aquatic habitats such as streams, rivers, and wetlands, as well as their adjacent terrestrial habitats, especially riparian areas and forests. Substantial portions of floodplain have been cleared for settlement and agriculture. The loss of natural floodplain habitats and riparian corridors often impacts water quality and adjacent aquatic habitat. And improving wildlife habitat in streams and rivers often requires conservation actions to improve adjacent floodplain and riparian habitats. Therefore aquatic, floodplain, wetland and riparian habitats will be addressed together. Priority Species The table below lists priority aquatic species in the CFA that occur in rivers and streams. This CFA contains more than half of the state’s occurrences of several species of mussel including Triangle Floater, Brook Floater, Yellow Lampmussel, as well as half of the state’s Wood Turtles and Spotted Turtles and at least 50% of three Dragonfly and Damselfly species: Yellow-sided Skimmer, Splendid Clubtail, and Spine-crowned Clubtail.

These areas provide core habitat and movement corridors for many of the priority species and rare plant communities listed above and are priority habitats. Patterson Creek, the Cacapon, North and Lost Rivers, Dillons Run, Trout Run, Waites Run and Tear Coat Creek are designated state mussel streams. These streams and several others support large clusters of biodiversity occurrences, and along with brook trout patches, require careful management to maintain those priority species. There is a large exemplary wetland complex in Short Mountain WMA that is home to SGCN and rare communities. In addition to providing important habitat for priority species, floodplain habitats along the larger rivers and numerous small stream riparian corridors are critical for maintaining the form and function of streams and rivers. Floodplain and riparian habitats and brook trout habitat patches outside of the larger forest patches may be more vulnerable to stresses. 37",

Warming temperatures and increased disturbances may enable non-native invasive plant species to outcompete native species. Although riparian forests are adapted to some level of disturbance and variable conditions, habitat alterations in agricultural and developed areas, habitat fragmentation and invasive species may limit the ability of riparian forests to adapt to climate change. 41",
        "The Assessment also describes how instream habitats and associated plant and animal species may be stressed by climate change-related increases in temperature, droughts, flood frequency and severity, and resulting erosion and sedimentation. Low flow events may also become more frequent and severe. Warming surface waters is likely to result in water quality degradation and eutrophication. Many aquatic species and life stages are adapted to specific timing and ranges of flow and temperature, as well as water quality variables. Climate change may impact different species and life stages in different ways. Cold water habitats and aquatic communities may be at particular risk. Areas within a watershed may be sensitive to increases in air temperature, depending on local factors such as watershed characteristics, position within the watershed, upstream land uses, groundwater contributions, forest cover and shading. Restoring and maintaining the health, size, and connectivity of native riparian forests along streams and rivers can provide riparian habitat, shade and cooling, organic matter, structure and debris, protect stream banks and in-stream habitat during high flows, and maintain water quality. Stabilizing eroding stream banks using natural channel design techniques, and reconnecting streams with their floodplains can restore fluvial processes and floodplain habitats. Cleaning and enlarging culverts and stream crossings to accommodate increased peak flows and aquatic organism passage can reduce flood damage to infrastructure and habitat and allow aquatic organisms to reach additional habitat as they adapt to changing conditions. Below is a summary of climate stresses on aquatic, floodplain and riparian habitat, and actions to boost their resilience (Swanston et. al, 2016). While climate stresses are listed separately, aquatic, floodplain and riparian habitats are often impacted by multiple climate stresses occurring simultaneously and actions to boost habitat resilience are intended to address multiple climate stresses. Many of these actions reiterate previously listed conservation actions to reduce stress on priority species and could have positive outcomes for priority species as well as habitat resilience. WVDNR, land managers, landowners and partners may select the actions best suited to their specific site conditions, management goals and objectives, from the list below or other sources.

        "Subterranean Habitats Karst and Cave Habitats Areas with karst geology and subterranean caves provide unique habitats that may be influenced by human activities, surface land use, and surface and underground hydrology in the surrounding landscape. Caves provide important habitat for bats that move in and out, as well as a diverse group of vertebrate and invertebrate animals that have evolved specialized adaptations to permanent underground living. Common traits exhibited by permanent cave dwellers (troglobites) include blindness (or complete loss of eyes) and reduced pigmentation. On the following pages, one map illustrates areas with karst geology running north to south in the central part of the CFA. Karst areas in smaller and more fragmented forest patches may be more vulnerable to stresses. The map on the subsequent page illustrates karst feature density with 3-kilometer buffers offset randomly, and one biologically significant cave near Wardensville with a 3-mile random offset buffer. This data was provided by the West Virginia Speleological Society, with offset buffers developed by WVDNR. Caves classified by WVDNR as biologically significant may host rare bat or endemic cave species, or exceptional biological diversity. These areas require careful management to minimize disturbance on karst and cave habitats and protect priority species. Priority Species Caves in this CFA provide core habitat for the following priority species, all of which are rare and dependent on specific cave habitats for their survival. Of special significance, this CFA hosts 67% of the state’s Allegheny Cave Amphipod, and 50% of the state’s Morrison’s Cave Amphipod.

        "Habitat Stresses and Conservation Actions for Karst and Cave Habitats Habitat Stress Conservation Action Education, wastewater treatment, fencing, riparian Water quality plantings Land protection, land use planning and careful Land use changes management around caves Climate Change and Habitat Resilience The Central Appalachians Forest Ecosystem Vulnerability Assessment (Butler et. al, 2015), noted that ecosystems that are limited by geological or hydrological features, such as cave and karst habitats, may be restricted from shifting across the landscape in response to climate change. However, cave and karst habitats that are connected more closely with groundwater inputs than surface water may be buffered by the impacts of climate change, and subterranean habitats may be buffered from increasing surface temperatures. But caves and karst areas may be vulnerable to groundwater extraction during droughts as well as changes in surface water flow regimes, nutrient inputs, high flows, and contaminants carried by floods, which may be exacerbated by impervious cover within the watershed (Swanston et. al, 2016). Restoring and maintaining riparian corridors, water quality and natural flow regimes, and limiting impervious cover in areas upstream and above caves and karst may boost the resilience of cave ecosystems. Some cave dwelling species also rely on adjacent forest, riparian and aquatic habitats. Maintaining the resilience of adjacent ecosystems could further buffer cave species from the impacts of climate change. Below is a summary of climate stresses on cave and karst habitats, and actions to boost their resilience. Although climate stresses are listed separately, subterranean habitats are often impacted by a multiple climate stresses occurring simultaneously and actions to boost habitat resilience are intended to address multiple climate stresses. Some of these actions repeat previously listed conservation actions to reduce stress on priority species and could benefit priority species while also boosting habitat resilience. WVDNR, partners and landowners can collaborate to select the habitat resilience actions best suited to site conditions, conservation goals and land management objectives.

        "Agricultural and Developed Habitats Many species of wildlife rely on agricultural lands, especially pastures and woody vegetation in fallow areas, abandoned fields, field borders, wetlands and riparian corridors. Some species even rely on habitat in more developed lands in residential and urban areas. Most agricultural lands and developed areas are in valley bottoms and floodplains. A map on the following page shows the location of agricultural and developed habitats and illustrates that they are associated with many examples of biodiversity. Maintaining pastures, fallow fields, woody vegetation, wetlands and riparian corridors is a priority for SGCN associated with these agricultural habitats. Priority Species Agricultural lands including cultivated crops, pastures, and hayfields, along with adjacent areas of natural vegetation in and around adjacent forests and woodlots, hedgerows, fallow areas, ponds, wetlands, streams, and riparian areas provide valuable habitat for several priority grassland bird species in the CFA. The following is a list of priority SGCN in the CFA associated with agricultural habitats. Developed areas also provide important habitat, most notably for the Chimney Swift. Priority Species in Agricultural and Developed Habitats TAXA SCIENTIFIC NAME COMMON NAME Birds Chaetura pelagica Chimney Swift Birds Tyto alba Barn Owl Birds Falco sparverius American Kestrel Birds Colinus virginianus Northern Bobwhite Birds Scolopax minor American Woodcock Birds Lanius ludovicianus migrans Migrant Loggerhead Shrike Birds Icteria virens Yellow-breasted Chat Birds Spizella pusilla Field Sparrow Birds Pooecetes gramineus Vesper Sparrow Birds Ammodramus savannarum Grasshopper Sparrow Birds Dolichonyx oryzivorus Bobolink Birds Sturnella magna Eastern Meadowlark Habitat Stresses and Conservation Actions The conversion of farmland for residential and commercial development reduces valuable habitat for wildlife, especially grassland birds. In addition, modern farming practices have resulted in the intensification of mechanized farming practices and the expansion of areas cleared for agriculture. Consequently, much natural vegetation providing wildlife habitat in grasslands, wetlands, fallow areas, riparian corridors, hedgerows, and forest edges has been cleared. The timing of agricultural practices also impacts some priority species. For example, early haying impacts ground nesting birds. Many SGCN also rely on habitat created by utility corridors, where the cutting of vegetation or herbicide treatment can have direct impacts on native birds and their nests. Rodenticides may also harm Barn Owls and other birds of prey. 52",

Likely changes include increasing temperatures, longer growing seasons, increasing number of hot days and nights, and changing precipitation patterns. Impacts include increases in the risk of damage to soil, crops, and infrastructure from extreme storm and precipitation events, flood damage, soil moisture stress and drought, competition from weeds and invasive plants, crop damage from insects and pathogens, and livestock parasites and pathogens. Butler et. al (2015) also noted that impervious surfaces in developed areas can exacerbate many of these impacts. Many wildlife species associated with agricultural and developed lands rely on grassland and pasture, fallow fields, floodplain and riparian corridors, streams and wetlands, and areas of natural vegetation around field and forest edges. In agricultural settings, these areas may already be degraded and sensitive to disturbance. As we have seen in previous sections of this plan, these areas may also be susceptible to impacts from climate change. Riparian forests may be vulnerable to climate change stressors including increased flood frequency and severity and resulting erosion and sedimentation in streams. Drought may stress streams and aquatic life, as well as plants, and increase their susceptibility to pests and pathogens. Warming temperatures and increased storm disturbances may enable non- native invasive plant species to outcompete native species. Janowiack et. al (2016) list numerous strategies to boost the resilience of agriculture to climate change, including maintaining soil health and water quality, reducing competition from weeds and invasive species, creating pollinator habitat, adapting farm infrastructure such as stream crossings to higher peak 54",
        "flows, adapting farm practices or shifting agricultural land use to match changing conditions. Managing farms as part of a larger landscape by maintaining, restoring and connecting natural habitats such as streams, wetlands, riparian areas and forest edges can boost the resilience of farms by buffering hydrological impacts while providing habitat and corridors wildlife to persist and adapt to climate change. In developed areas, limiting and buffering impervious surfaces, and using constructed wetlands and other green infrastructure can also reduce the hydrological impacts of climate change. Below is a summary of climate stresses on wildlife habitat in agricultural and developed areas, and actions to boost their resilience. Climate stresses are listed separately, but agricultural habitats are often impacted by a multiple climate stresses occurring simultaneously. Therefore, actions to boost habitat resilience are intended to address multiple climate stresses. These actions reinforce conservation actions to reduce stress on priority species in agricultural and developed habitats. WVDNR, partners and landowners can collaborate to select the habitat resilience actions best suited to site conditions, conservation goals and land management objectives.

        "Landscape Resilience and Connectivity For the Cacapon River and Patterson Creek CFA, the SWAP included the following conservation action: • Implement a comprehensive plan to enhance climate change resiliency through reducing other stressors, identifying, maintaining, and creating key habitat cores and corridors, and protecting areas of high landscape complexity and integrity”. The conservation and resilience actions described previously in this action plan aim to reduce stressors on priority species in each major habitat type and enhance the resilience of those habitats to climate change. Some of those actions include protecting refugia, core areas of intact habitats and habitat corridors. Habitat cores are patches of high-quality habitat for priority species, surrounded by areas with a different community structure, and serve as nodes in a connected ecological network (Harrison and Odell, 2016; USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2004). Habitat cores identified for protection in this CFA include large forest blocks, wetlands, habitats limited to specific soil types and geology such as shale barrens, cliffs and talus, biologically significant caves and their buffer zones, and core aquatic habitat such as mussel streams and brook trout habitat patches. Important habitat corridors identified for protection include connected forest patches, intact river floodplains and small stream riparian forests. Protecting corridors of terrestrial and aquatic habitat connected to habitat patches and larger core areas may allow for species movement and enhance the flow of genetic material in response to climate change (Butler et. al, 2015; Anderson et. al, 2016a). But wildlife conservation in changing climate may require conservation actions at a landscape level, across habitat types, and beyond individual habitat cores and corridors. Anderson (2016b) summarized a wealth of current research demonstrating how the increasing frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and fires may cause species to respond by shifting location or behavior within their existing habitat, evolving to adapt to new conditions, or shifting their distributions across the landscape. Evidence has been documented for over 1000 species currently shifting one of four ways: locally toward suitable microclimate, upslope to higher elevations, downslope towards moist riparian areas, and northward toward cooler latitudes. However, landscape fragmentation has been shown to slow movement in response to climate change. Enabling wildlife to shift and adapt to climate change will require the conservation of a network of unfragmented landscapes within which species can shift their range to more suitable local microclimates or upslope, downslope or northward. In 2008 the WVDNR developed a model of landscape integrity to identify unfragmented landscapes. The map on the subsequent page illustrates areas of high landscape integrity in the CFA. Landscape integrity is estimated to increase with distance from roads, powerlines, development, and other features that fragment the landscape. These high integrity landscapes tend to correspond to larger forest patches and most lie within public lands including the George Washington National Forest along the east side of the CFA, as well as Lost River and Cacapon Resort State Parks, and Short Mountain WMA. There are also landscapes of high integrity in private ownership, notably south of Short Mountain WMA and along the Mineral – Hampshire county line east of Patterson Creek. These areas are important for species movement in response to climate change and are priorities for protection of wildlife habitat. 58",
        "Landscape Integrity 59",
        "Building on the concept of landscape integrity, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) led a team of 60 scientists to identify areas representing all geophysical settings, with varied microclimates and natural cover, that were most likely to sustain native plants and animals and natural processes into the future and be resilient to climate change. The team identified resilient sites as those with topographic and elevation diversity that offer a range of habitat types and microclimates for species and ecosystems to adapt to climate change, along with high landscape integrity or local connectedness where species could move locally and disperse in response to climate change, and where natural processes like fire and floods could continue unimpeded. These are core areas for species movement and adaptation at a local level. They then modeled the movement or flow of species across the landscape over time in response to climate change, and as constrained by natural and human-caused barriers. This led to the identification of corridors of constrained movement, and flow zones of dispersed movement. These are corridors and core areas for species movement and adaptation at a landscape level. Lastly the team developed models that integrated landscape resilience, connectivity and the flow of species and populations across the landscape to develop a connected network of sites that represents the full suite of geophysical settings, includes known records of biological diversity, and has the configuration and connections necessary to support the continued movement of species in response to change conditions. To identify the subset of places most essential for sustaining biodiversity in a changing climate and aligned to the natural flow patterns across the region, the team then identified the most resilient and diverse lands representing all of the region’s geophysical settings, recorded occurrences of biological diversity, resilient lands already secured through public ownership or conservation easements, and the riparian corridors and other landscape linkages with the most concentrated movement of species. This prioritized network covers 23% of the land in the Eastern United States. This work is documented in Resilient Sites for Terrestrial Conservation in Eastern North America (Anderson et al, 2016a), and Resilient and Connected Landscapes for Terrestrial Conservation (Anderson et al, 2016b). The studies produced a series of maps (see http://maps.tnc.org/resilientland/) that identified the following areas: • Resilient area: a place buffered from climate change because it contains diverse, complex, connected landscapes with many micro-climates that create options for species adapting to climate change. • Climate corridor: a narrow conduit of natural cover in which the movement of plants and animals becomes concentrated, often along a stream corridor or ridgeline. • Climate flow zone: areas with high levels of plant and animal movement that is less concentrated than in a corridor, such as an intact forest patches and areas of high integrity. On the following page, the regional map of priority resilient and connected landscapes illustrates that the resilient, connected landscapes of the CFA form a critical bridge between the large forest blocks, resilient landscapes and flow zones to the south and the narrower climate corridors along the ridges and valleys stretching northeast into Pennsylvania. The resilient, connected landscapes in this CFA are critical to the species adapting to climate change within the larger network across the Eastern United States. 60",

        "On the next page is a more detailed view of the priority resilient, connected network of landscapes within the Cacapon River and Patterson Creek CFA, which includes many resilient lands, flow zones and corridors with confirmed biodiversity. On the eastern half of the Cacapon portion of the CFA there is a network of climate corridors, resilient areas and flow zones stretching from the state boundary on the Great North Mountain and Cove Mountain in the south, then north along the ridges on the east side of the North River, to the ridges around the Cacapon River. Other connected blocks of resilient land occur on the west side of the Cacapon watershed from Shenandoah and Branch Mountains in the south, up to around Spring Gap Mountain and Sideling Hill in the north. The Patterson Creek portion of the CFA also includes several blocks of resilient lands and connected landscapes, including the lands along Patterson Creek Mountain on the east, from Knobly Mountain in the Southwest north to Stagg Run, and the area toward the confluence of Patterson Creek and the North Branch at the Maryland State line. These priority resilient and connected landscapes contain the CFA’s large forest patches and high integrity areas, and most of the CFA’s rock outcrop, cliff and talus, and shale barren habitats, cave and karst features, and known biodiversity. Smaller patches of fragmented forest and agricultural areas are not included. Protecting and maintaining these areas of high landscape integrity and the resilient areas, climate corridors and climate flow zones within the region’s priority resilient and connected network is critical in order to enable priority SGCN and their habitat to adapt to climate change and persist in this CFA. These areas are priorities for conservation action within the CFA. The table below summarizes conservation actions for climate resilience to address stresses from climate change at a landscape level.

        "Conclusion Habitat Conservation Priorities This action plan lists priority species and rare plant communities targeted for conservation action on public and private land and within each major habitat type. The major habitat types include forests and woodlands, barrens, cliffs and talus, caves and karst, aquatic, riparian and floodplain habitats, and developed and agricultural habitats. For each major habitat type the plan identifies stresses that affect priority species, conservation actions to reduce those stresses, climate stresses on those habitats and actions to boost resilience, partners that can assist with conservation actions to implement the plan, and the human benefits of conservation. Below is a list of the priority habitats identified by this Action Plan for conservation action within each major habitat type. • Large, intact forest patches, including interior forest habitat • Early successional forest habitat • Small areas of unique, geologically derived habitat including: o Acidic rock outcrops, cliffs and talus o Calcareous cliffs and talus o Shale barrens • Areas with karst geology and caves, and their watersheds • Buffer areas surrounding biologically significant caves • Special aquatic habitats, such as mussel streams, brook trout habitat patches and wetlands • Small stream riparian and river floodplain habitats • Riparian corridors, wetlands, fallow fields, field borders and other areas of natural and woody vegetation within and around agricultural lands. These priority habitats include habitat cores and corridors that are critical for maintaining wildlife populations in this CFA. To protect priority SGCN and enable them to adapt to changing conditions within these priority habitats, landowners and partner organizations are encouraged to plan and implement conservation actions to alleviate stresses on priority species and boost habitat resilience, and carefully monitor the results using an adaptive management framework such as the Climate Smart Conservation Cycle included in the introduction. Stakeholders are also encouraged to coordinate with relevant agencies to develop strategies to avoid, minimize and mitigate for impacts to these priority habitats. Integration of Conservation Actions Integration of conservation actions within the above priority habitats, such as projects to improve mussel stream habitat by improving wastewater treatment, enlarging stream crossings and plant riparian stream buffers may benefit multiple plant communities and wildlife species. Coordinating actions across multiple habitats, such as protecting large patches of diverse forest habitats that also include rare shale barrens, rock outcrops or cliff and talus habitats, or improving water quality and 65",
        "planting riparian corridors in karst landscapes or cave watersheds, may benefit additional species. Private landowners, public land managers and conservation partners are encouraged to focus resources across habitats to maximize benefits to multiple species in areas targeted for action in ways. Connecting Conservation Actions for Climate Resilience As we have seen, conservation actions to relieve stresses on priority species and efforts to boost the resilience of wildlife habitat are essential for enabling climate adaptation. Maintaining and protecting areas of high landscape integrity as well as the regional network of resilient lands, climate corridors, and flow zones is also critical for enabling wildlife species to adapt to changing conditions and shift across the landscape. Furthermore, creating local networks of connected habitat cores and corridors will enhance their resilience and connectivity, and the ability of wildlife species to adapt to changing conditions within this CFA. Connected local networks of headwater streams and larger rivers, their riparian corridors, floodplains, and wetlands enhances the stability of these habitats and enables fish, reptiles, birds, and other priority wildlife species that depend on those habitats to move across the landscape as conditions change. Maintaining connections between patches of diverse forest habitat and with rare shale barrens, rock outcrops, cliff and talus, karst or cave habitat buffers enhances the resilience of these habitats and enables forest species to move to optimal sites as conditions change. Conservation of aquatic, riparian and floodplain corridors along with areas of native vegetation in and around agricultural areas, small forest patches and larger blocks of forest habitat can create a local network of resilient, connected lands that merges into the larger regional network. Beyond undertaking conservation actions in the priority habitats listed above, and even beyond protecting the regional network of climate connectors and flow zones, stakeholders are encouraged to restore and protect the connections between these areas in order to maintain an interwoven fabric of natural systems for wildlife within this CFA to thrive long into the future. Next Steps in Implementation WVDNR engaged a working group of partner organizations and public land managers in developing this Action Plan and will seek to remain engaged by convening semi-annual meetings with the working group to collaborate on actions including the following: • Planning, implementing, and evaluating ongoing field surveys of priority species to document and monitor their abundance, distribution, population trends, vulnerability, and range shifts • Planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the results of the conservation actions; and • Engaging and supporting private landowners in this work WVDNR may lead some of these efforts but will most often play the role of supporting efforts by the many partners active in this CFA with ongoing projects, established programs, and connections with landowners. In the case of public lands, WVDNR will also seek to incorporate conservation actions targeting priority species, habitats, and priority areas for conservation action into agency planning processes and support those actions. WVDNR will also work with state agencies and other authorities to promote avoidance, minimization, and mitigation for development impacts to priority habitats and other priority areas for conservation action. 66",
