The goal of the assessment is to combine state-of-the-art analyses with effective outreach to provide opinion leaders, policy makers, and the public with the best available science upon which to base informed choices about climate-change mitigation and adaptation.

Ü The Northeast is already experiencing changes consistent with global warming: rising temperatures, decreasing snow cover, and earlier arrival of spring. Ü Due to emissions in the recent past, average temperatures across the Northeast are projected to rise another 2.5 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) in winter and 1.5°F to 3.5°F in summer above his- toric levels over the next several decades. The extent and severity of climate change beyond mid- century, however, will be determined by emissions choices we make now—in the North- east and around the world. Ü If emissions remain high, average temperatures across the Northeast are projected to rise, by late this century, 8°F to 12°F above historic levels in winter and 6°F to 14°F in summer. Cities across the Northeast are projected to average 20 days per summer over 100°F and some (such as Philadel- phia and Hartford, CT) could average nearly 30 such days. The length of the winter snow season could be cut in half across Maine, New Hampshire, northern New York, and Vermont. Ü Smaller climate-related changes can be expected if the world follows the lower-emissions pathway used in this assessment—typically about half the change expected under the higher- emissions scenario. By late-century, for example, average temperature is projected to increase 5°F to 8°F in winter and 3°F to 7°F in summer under the lower-emissions scenario. Most cities are projected to average only a few days over 100°F. In the northern part of the region, a decrease in the length of the winter snow season of more than 25 percent is projected. Ü Because some additional warming is inevitable, it is now essential to prepare to adapt to the changes that cannot be avoided.

The first is directly related to human activity: how much CO and other heat-trapping gases will our industrial 2 and land-use activities emit over the coming cen- tury? The second is scientific in nature: how will the climate respond to these emissions (e.g., how much will temperatures rise in response to a given increase in atmospheric CO)? 2 To address the first uncertainty, the IPCC has de- veloped a set of possible futures, or scenarios, that project global levels of emissions of heat-trapping gases based on a wide range of development vari- ables including population growth, energy use, and other societal choices.11 IPCC Emissions Scenarios NECIA analyses used the IPCC’s A1fi and B1 sce- Projected carbon emissions for the IPCC SRES narios to represent possible higher- and lower-emis- scenarios.12 The higher-emissions scenario (A1fi) sions choices, respectively, over the course of the corresponds to the dotted red line while the lower- century.

Global climate models produce output in the form of geographic grid-based projections of daily, monthly, and annual temperatures, precipitation, winds, cloud cover, humidity, and a host of other climate variables. The grid cells range in size from 50 to 250 miles on a side. To transform these global projections into “higher-resolution” regional projec- tions (which look at changes occurring across tens of miles rather than hundreds) NECIA scientists used well-established statistical and dynamical downscal- ing techniques.15,16 Uncertainties in climate modeling and the work- ings of the earth-atmosphere system remain. Several lines of evidence suggest that the climate-model projections used in the NECIA assessment may be relatively conservative.

This acceleration is caused by two different mechanisms related to increasing temperatures: thermal expan- sion of seawater as it warms and increasing inflow of water from melting ice sheets and glaciers. Assuming no further warming, a continuation of the recent historical rate of global sea-level rise could lead to a nearly six-inch increase over 2005 levels by the end of the century.25 (See the coastal chapter.) Factoring in further global warming, however, the IPCC projects that global sea levels will rise between 7 and 14 inches under the lower-emissions scenario and between 10 and 23 inches under the higher- emissions scenario.26 (See Figure 4, which shows the averages or mid-ranges for each of the sea-level rise scenarios considered here.)

Several lines of evidence indicate that these projections may be quite conservative. Ü Even under these projections, many areas of the densely populated Northeast coast face substantial increases in the extent and frequency of coastal flooding and are at increased risk of severe storm-related damage. — Boston and Atlantic City, for example, can expect a coastal flood equivalent to today’s 100-year flood every two to four years on average by mid-century and almost annually by the end of the century. — New York City is projected to face flooding equivalent to today’s 100-year flood once every decade on average under the higher-emissions scenario and once every two decades under the lower-emissions scenario by century’s end. Ü Sea-level rise is also projected to permanently inundate low-lying coastal areas and increase shoreline erosion and wetland loss. The areas most vulnerable to shoreline erosion include portions of Cape Cod, Long Island, and most of coastal New Jersey. Ü Because of the erosive impact of waves (especially storm waves), the extent of shoreline retreat and wetland loss is projected to be many times greater than the loss of land caused by the rise in sea level itself. Ü The high concentration of population, property, infrastructure, and economic activity in coastal areas of the Northeast create considerable challenges for emergency response, hazard mitigation, and land-use planning. Combined with the conservative nature of these sea-level rise projections, these factors leave little room for delay or complacency in reducing heat-trapping emissions and adapting to rising sea levels.

On the other hand, loss of beach in one area may result in the shifting of sand to another beach close by, and communities and industry may be able to adapt to these changes over the long term—but not without enormous financial and social costs. As the IPCC points out, the current level of adap- tation among North American coastal communities to historic and expected sea-level rise is uneven, and readiness for increased exposure is low.71 Options for managing climate-change risks are constrained by past development and land-use patterns as well as current coastal laws and regulations, and the expec- tations they have fostered among coastal property owners. Coastal managers are faced with the difficult challenge of adapting regulations to protect against increasing risks rather than historic risks. As noted above, Maine is furthest along in tackling this chal- lenge because it has implemented shoreline regula- tions that take future sea-level rise into account. The insurance industry can help distribute cli- mate-change risks so the burden is shared by the many rather than just the few. For this industry, global warming represents both new perils and new business opportunities. (See the text box on coast- al insurance.) The Northeast, being a center of the U.S. insurance industry, has an opportunity to play a leading role in shaping the industry’s response to climate change. Public education about the region’s changing exposure to risk will need to be increased and linked to strict enforcement of building codes and land- use regulations, may require mandatory insurance coverage, and involve other activities that minimize risk. Continued and enhanced access to insurance, as well as long-term mitigation loans and subsi- dies, will play a critical role in protecting particularly vulnerable people living in high-risk areas.

The wetlands near Shorebird Point in Biddeford, ME (pictured here), for example, receive only limited quantities of river-borne sediment and thus are highly vulnerable to becoming permanently inundated under the projected rates of sea-level rise.30 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST COASTAL IMPACTS 31 Changes in Storm Patterns The storms that most commonly menace the North- northeasterly winds as the storm follows the jet east are the winter storms known as nor’easters, stream north along the Atlantic seaboard.

Climate models suggest little change in storm fre- quency this century, but by century’s end under the higher-emissions scenario, be- tween 5 and 15 percent more late-winter storms will move far enough north to affect the Northeast (about one additional late- winter storm per year). If lower emissions pre- vail, little change is projected in the number of nor’easters that strike the region. Although rarer than nor’easters, the Northeast is also occasionally affected by tropical storms and hurricanes that form in the Atlantic during the summer and fall. There is growing evidence that the intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes has already been increasing;75,76,77 debate continues over a definitive link between global warming and increased hurricane frequency.78,79,80,81,82 It is clear that observed ocean warming—a key condition for the formation and strengthen- ing of hurricanes—cannot be explained by natural cycles alone.

Commercial fish and shellfish including cod, lobster, sea scallops, and Gulf of Maine shrimp have water-temperature thresholds that define the conditions within which they can successfully reproduce, grow, and survive to “recruitment” (i.e., when they are large enough to harvest). Sizable stocks of these species are not typi- cally found in waters that fail to meet such thermal requirements. Therefore, the warming projected over the course of this century may lead to a loss of tradi- tional, high-value species in some areas, while lob- ster populations in much of the Gulf of Maine may benefit. Global warming may also drive complex shifts in ocean circulation, nutrient supplies, plank- ton production, and other factors that shape marine ecosystems in ways that are difficult to predict.

These two events were likely related. Since most climate-change scenarios project the Labrador Sea and other higher-latitude waters to become fresher as a result of increased ice melt, conditions in the Gulf of Maine during the 1990s may be a preview of the future impact of global warming. Some changes in Arctic climate and the strength of different currents that exchange waters between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic have been linked to a shift in plankton abundance in the Gulf of Maine and on Georges Bank, with cascading effects for marine life in these waters.7 Present scientific models, however, cannot project changes in these ocean current systems.

Bottom water temperatures in Long Island Sound that sum- mer were at highs for the decade and, in some loca- tions, exceeded 74°F in August. Temperatures above 70°F continued into October.60 Lobster numbers at the time were near historic highs, and as the animals moved to deeper, cooler waters to escape the warm shallows, they became increasingly crowded and subject to oxygen stress and exposure to disease. Many of the weakened lobsters were afflicted with paramoebiasis, a potentially fatal condition caused by a parasite.61 Although the dockside value of the lobster fishery in the southern part of the Northeast has historically been modest compared with states to the north (in 1998, prior to the Long Island Sound Lobstering: A Lucrative but Precarious Way of Life die-off, combined lobster landings in Connecticut, The American lobster is one of the Northeast’s most valuable commercial New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island represented catches—Maine lobstermen alone hauled in more than 70 million pounds 23 percent of the Northeast total), the sharp decline of lobster worth $311 million in 2005.

Ü Many tree species, including the hardwoods that generate the region’s brilliant fall foliage, may be able to persist this century even as their optimal climate zones shift northward. Other species, however, may succumb to climate stress, increased competition, and other pressures. Ü If the higher-emissions scenario prevails, productivity of spruce/fir forests is expected to decline and suitable habitat will all but disappear from the Northeast by the end of the century. Major losses are projected even under the lower-emissions scenario. This would greatly exacerbate stresses on the pulp and paper industry in the Northeast, particularly in Maine, where the forest-based manufacturing industry is key to the state’s economy. Ü Diminished spruce/fir habitat, especially at higher elevations, would increase pressure on associated animal species such as the snowshoe hare, Canada lynx, and Bicknell’s thrush, one of the region’s prized songbirds. With the late-century summer warming projected under the higher-emissions scenario, suitable habitat for the Bicknell’s thrush could be eliminated from the region. Ü Substantial changes in bird life are expected across the Northeast due to rising temperatures, shifting distribution of suitable habitat, or declining habitat quality. The greatest changes are projected under the higher-emissions scenario, including declines in the abundance of many migratory songbirds such as the American goldfinch, song sparrow, and Baltimore oriole. Ü Winter warming will threaten hemlock stands, not only by reducing suitable habitat for these trees, but also by allowing northward expansion of a fatal pest known as the hemlock woolly adelgid—as far north as Canada by late-century under the higher-emissions scenario.

Since the late 1990s, more than one-third of Maine’s land, for example, has changed ownership.6,7 About 6 million forested acres across the northern Northeast states have been sold in this same period. Some of North America’s most complex mix- tures of tree species occur in the Northeast, where the more boreal forests to the north transition to the more temperate hardwood forests to the south.8 Climate change is not expected to cause a net loss of forested land, but it is projected to alter the char- acter of the region’s forests over the coming century. Some current forest types would give way to new forest types that will have combinations of species different from those we know today. The forest types that characterize various parts of the Northeast are defined by their major con- stituent tree species: for example, white/red/jack pine, oak/hickory, spruce/fir, or maple/birch/beech. Each species within these forests has unique habitat requirements. Climate plays a major role in deter- mining suitable habitat for trees (i.e., where indi- vidual tree species can establish themselves, grow, and survive). It also has a significant effect on how quickly trees grow and how entire forest ecosystems function (in terms of how they cycle water and nutri- ents).

The eventual changes in forest composition and function could profoundly alter the scenery and character of the region, as well as the services the Spruce/Fir Northeast’s forests provide. These services include recreation, tourism, wildlife habitat, timber and other forest products, protection of watersheds and drinking water supplies, carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and soil conservation. Maple/Beech/Birch Current PROJECTED CHANGES IN NORTHEAST FORESTS NECIA researchers modeled potential shifts in the distribution of habitat suitable for 134 tree species throughout the Northeast (based on their current Oak/Hickory climatic range) under both the lower- and higher- emissions scenarios.9 Another NECIA analysis ex- amined the potential impact of rising temperatures Lower Emissions and atmospheric CO (individually and combined) 2 on productivity (growth), net carbon uptake, nitro- Elm/Ash/Cottonwood gen cycling, and water yield in five forest research sites across the region.10 A third analysis modeled changes in the expanding range of a forest insect pest, the hemlock woolly adelgid.11 Finally, another study analyzed the way in which the distribution of birds might change as forest habitat shifts over time Loblolly/Shortleaf Pine and habitat quality declines.12 Higher Emissions Habitat suitable for most of the region’s tree spe- Other No Data cies is projected to move northeast as the climate continues to warm.

As winters continue to warm over the coming century, forest soils will remain frozen for shorter periods, freeze less deeply, or potentially not freeze at all in more southerly areas. The industry may be able to cope by investing in timber harvesting equipment currently employed in other parts of the country where soils do not freeze. However, switching to new equipment can be ex- pensive, and minimizing the economic impact will require that timber managers carefully weigh when climate changes are clear enough to warrant an im- mediate investment rather than waiting to upgrade as part of normal equipment turnover.

Acid rain, suburban sprawl, and the “channelization” of streams have further reduced na- tive populations in recent decades.32 Now global warming adds a new threat to the survival of native coldwater species, as warmer conditions across the Northeast increase water temperatures, reduce win- ter snow and ice cover, and alter the timing, dura- tion, and volume of seasonal stream flow.33,34,35 These species, including brook trout, lake trout, Atlantic salmon, and several types of whitefish, are described as “coldwater” fish because they generally require year-round access to water temperatures below 70°F. Summer temperatures in many north- ern streams and lakes have already risen beyond that threshold,36 but native stream fish have con- tinued to thrive due to the presence of small cold- water refuges such as tributaries and areas where groundwater enters a stream. Similarly, most north- ern lakes deeper than 30 feet “stratify” during the summer, a process that insulates water near the bottom from the warm air and provides a thermal refuge for lake fish.

All major coldwater species, for example, spawn in late fall and spend the winter on the bottom of lakes and rivers, where they are usually insulated from severe cold and protected from storms by surface ice. The pre- dictable onset and duration of ice cover are linked to the timing of egg hatching and larval feeding, which in turn determine the success of coldwater fish such as lake trout and lake whitefish.49 Warmer winters with less consistent ice formation could threaten the survival of these species in northern lakes. Predictable seasonal changes in stream flow also provide important cues for fish. For example, egg hatching is timed so that young fish can quickly seek refuge from the strong flow generated by spring snowmelt. Large changes in the timing of peak spring flow have already been measured in the last Will Fewer Native Fish Be Biting? 50 years50 and are projected to continue as winters Many residents of the Northeast, young and old, enjoy warm, potentially disrupting this survival strategy.

The Northeast is certainly water-rich in comparison with the western United States. Water supplies drawn from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and under- ground aquifers quench the thirst of one of the most densely populated regions in the nation and also serve the needs of crops, livestock, industri- al processes, and energy generation. In addition, the Northeast’s fresh- water resources provide habitat for fish and other wildlife along with op- portunities for recreational activities such as fishing and boating.

In the Northeast global warming is projected to affect water resources in the following ways.1,2 • Alter the timing and amount of stream flow, which would create: – more high-flow events in winter, particularly under the higher-emissions scenario, with an associated risk of winter flooding; – earlier peak flows in spring—roughly two weeks earlier under the higher-emissions scenario and 10 days earlier under the lower-emissions scenario; and – extended low-flow periods in summer—nearly a month longer by late-century under the higher- emissions scenario, with little change under the lower-emissions scenario. • Increase winter precipitation (much of which is expected to fall as rain) 20 to 30 percent by late-century under either emissions scenario. • Reduce snowpack and shorten the snow season in the typically snowy northern states— up to 50 percent by late-century under the higher-emissions scenario and more than 25 percent under the lower-emissions scenario. • Increase the frequency of short-term (one- to three-month) droughts3 by late-century from an average of once every two to three years to once every year across the Adirondacks, Catskills, and most of New England under the higher-emissions scenario, with little change under the lower-emissions scenario. • Increase the frequency of extremely hot days (which can increase water demand) roughly five-fold under the higher-emissions scenario and two- to three-fold under the lower-emissions scenario. • Increase the likelihood and severity of damaging rainstorms under both scenarios. • Raise sea levels between 10 and 23 inches under the higher-emissions scenario and 7 and 14 inches under the lower-emissions scenario, increasing the risk of saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers.WATER: A VITAL RESOURCE 63 These projections raise a number flows through the summer and fall. growth, water supplies could also de- of questions for Northeast water- Diminished snowpack and earlier crease due to evapotranspiration (i.e., resource managers—and users—in- snowmelt may reduce the replenish- the loss of water from the surface of cluding: will changes in hydrology ment of groundwater, which can in water bodies, the soil’s surface, and lead to changes in water quality and turn reduce summer and fall stream the pores on plant surfaces). supply?

Ü A longer growing season may allow farmers to experiment with new crops, but many traditional farm operations in the region will become unsustainable without adaptation strategies that could be quite costly in some cases. Ü Without adaptation measures, increasing summer heat stress is projected, by mid-century, to depress milk production and the yields of a number of economically important crops across southern parts of the region, particularly under the higher-emissions scenario. By late-century under this scenario, milk production across much of the region could decline 5 to 20 percent in certain months, with the greatest losses in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. By contrast, little change is expected under the lower-emissions scenario. Ü Parts of the Northeast are projected to become unsuitable for growing certain popular varieties of apples, blueberries, and cranberries by mid-century, since they require long winter-chill periods to produce fruit. Ü European wine grapes are expected to benefit from warmer winters, but yields of native grape varieties such as the Concord are projected to decline. Ü Weed problems and pest-related damage are likely to escalate, increasing pressures on farmers to use more herbicides and pesticides. Ü An increasing number of storms producing heavy rainfall may delay spring planting and damage crops and soils, while more frequent droughts during the growing season—particularly under the higher-emissions scenario—could make irrigation essential for most high-value crops. Ü By late-century many of these trends are projected to be highly pronounced across most of the Northeast under the higher-emissions scenario, but more constrained in magnitude and geographic extent under the lower-emissions scenario.

Global warming will negatively affect dairy and other livestock op- erations by increasing the intensity and frequency of summer heat stress, which can depress both milk production and birthing rates in dairy cows for weeks or even months. The optimal temperature for milk production ranges from 40°F to 75°F, depending on the humidity; for example, heat stress can occur at temperatures as low as 75°F when the relative hu- midity is 65 percent or higher, but at temperatures of 80°F, heat stress requires relative humidity of only 30 percent.7 Heat stress already causes an estimated $2.4 Higher Temperatures Depress Milk Production billion in annual losses to U.S. livestock industries.8 Dairy cows are sprayed with water to keep them cool.

Ü Snowmobiling is the most vulnerable of the region’s economically important winter recreation activities because, unlike the ski industry, it cannot rely on machine-made snow. Within the next several decades, snowmobiling opportunities are projected to become virtually non-existent in Pennsylvania and western and southeastern New York under either emissions scenario used in this assessment. Ü By late-century, average season length across the region is projected to decline to 13 days under the higher-emissions scenario, an 80 percent decline below recent levels, and to 25 days under the lower-emissions scenario, a 57 percent decline. Only northern New Hampshire would retain a snowmobile season longer than two months if higher emissions prevail. Ü Warmer winters would also shorten the average ski and snowboard seasons, increase snow- making requirements, and drive up operating costs (particularly under the higher-emissions scenario). This may prompt further closures and consolidation of ski areas northward toward the Canadian border. Ü Under the higher-emissions scenario, only the northern New England states and the North Country of New York are projected to support viable ski operations by mid-century. By the latter part of the century, only western Maine is projected to retain a reliable ski season under the higher-emissions scenario. Ü Under the lower-emissions scenario, reliable ski seasons can be expected through this century in the North Country of New York and parts of Vermont and New Hampshire, in addition to western Maine. Ü These projections may be conservative, as the climate models used in this analysis have consistently underestimated the rapid winter warming and snowpack decline observed in recent decades.

This trend is expected to continue in the coming decades under both the lower- and higher-emissions scenarios, but with faster and farther-reaching changes under higher emissions. Projected season-length changes in six of the 15 snowmobiling areas studied are presented here. By mid-century, only northern areas with historically long snow- mobiling seasons are expected to retain sufficient snow for a two-month season or longer.84 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST IMPACTS ON WINTER RECREATION 85 Ice Fishing: A Threatened Tradition Ice fishing derbies are a winter institution in parts of the Northeast, bringing well-bundled anglers out to drill holes through the ice of frozen lakes and wait for perch, pickerel, pike, bass, trout, or tiger muskie. But the Northeast’s winters—and its ice fishing—are not what they used to be. In 2007 the New York State Crappie Derby was canceled for the second year in a row because the ice on Whitney Point Lake in mid-January was so thin that the contest’s sponsors feared for anglers’ safety. A similar fate befell that year’s Berkshire Wild Turkey Federation Derby on Lake Buel in western Massachusetts, while many others were postponed into February.18,19,20 As winters have warmed over the past century, the duration of ice cover on the region’s lakes has decreased. “Ice-in” dates (when the majority of a lake or pond has frozen over) have been occurring later in winter while ice-out dates (when ice cover has largely melted) are arriving earlier in spring. The duration of ice cover on southern Maine’s Se- bago Lake, for example, has declined by two weeks since the mid-nineteenth century, and the rate of decline has accelerated over the past 25 years. In addition, the once-rare years when Sebago Lake fails to freeze at all are occurring more frequently. The same is true of Lake Champlain on the New York-Vermont border, which has failed to freeze over in a dozen winters since 1970.

Some snowmobiling enthusiasts may switch to ATVs, which are not dependent on snow conditions. In the past five years U.S. ATV sales have grown while snowmobile sales have declined, suggesting that the transition is already under way in some regions. A large switch from snowmobiling to ATV use would have important implications for land managers and communities in the Northeast since ATVs tend to have far more damaging impacts on vegetation and recreational trails. Some snowmobiling-dependent communities are already debating whether to allow ATVs on snowmobile trails in low- or no-snow years.23 Concerns about snowmobiling apply, to a cer- tain extent, to other activities that depend almost entirely on natural snow cover, such as cross-country Snowmaking Needs and Costs to Increase skiing, sledding, and snowshoeing.

Ü Under the higher-emissions scenario, for example, Pittsburgh and the Concord/Manchester area of New Hampshire could each experience roughly 25 days over 100°F every summer by the end of the century, and typically cooler cities such as Buffalo could average 14 such days. Ü Global warming could worsen air pollution in the Northeast, creating more days when national air-quality standards cannot be met (particularly under the higher-emissions scenario). Deteriorating air quality would exacerbate the risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, and other ailments in states such as Massachusetts, which already has the highest rate of adult asthma in the United States. Ü In the Philadelphia metropolitan region, for example, the number of days failing to meet the federal ozone standard is expected to at least quadruple by late-century under the higher- emissions scenario if local vehicle and industrial emissions of ozone-forming pollutants are not reduced.

For example, as the entire nation sweltered dur- ing the summer of 2006, New York City experienced two heat waves—a three-day period in July and a 10-day period in July and August when maximum temperatures soared to 90°F or higher each day— that produced the city’s highest death toll from heat stroke in more than half a century. Of the 46 people who died, more than 80 percent were age 50 or old- er, 68 percent had multiple medical conditions (most often including heart disease), and only two people had working air conditioners.

In 2004, for example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found at least part of every state in the region except Vermont to be out of compliance with its ground-level ozone standards (which limit average ozone concentrations to 0.08 part per million over an eight-hour period). Since then, the Northeast’s states have been work- ing to improve their air quality and, by the end of 2006, ozone concentrations in Maine had improved enough to meet the EPA standard.20,21 However, the region still hosts five of the nation’s 25 most ozone- polluted metropolitan areas:22 Smog Blankets Philadelphia (cid:37)(cid:3) New York City-Newark-Bridgeport (encompass- ing counties in Connecticut, New Jersey, New As the country’s tenth most ozone-polluted metropolitan York, and Pennsylvania; #9 overall) area, Philadelphia is sadly accustomed to smog—a potent combination of ground-level ozone and fine particulate mat- (cid:37)(cid:3) Philadelphia-Camden-Vineland (encompassing ter (such as soot).

Reducing people’s expo- sure to climate-related risks can be addressed, for ex- ample, through raising awareness of heat- or flood- related risks, evacuating people from floodplains, preventing development in hazardous areas when possible, and providing access to spaces for cool- ing off during prolonged periods of extreme heat. Focusing on populations and communities that are particularly vulnerable to climate-related hazards, such as the elderly during heat waves, would ad- dress sensitivity to risk.

Ü Concerted action to reduce emissions in the Northeast—on the order of 80 percent below 2000 levels by mid-century and just over 3 percent per year on average over the next few decades— can help pull global emissions below the lower-emissions scenario described here. As both a world leader in technology, finance, and innovation and a major source of heat-trapping emissions, the Northeast is well positioned to help drive national and international progress toward this goal. Ü The Northeast’s decision makers—from individual households to industry and government— have myriad options available today for reducing emissions from each of the region’s four major sources of CO : electric power, buildings, transportation, and industry. 2 Ü Consumers and policy makers at all levels can accelerate the region’s transition from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy resources (including solar, wind, and geothermal) through energy choices supported by market incentives and regulations. Ü Energy users can significantly curb emissions by embracing efficiency: purchasing energy- efficient lighting and small appliances and replacing vehicles, heating and cooling systems, motors, and large appliances with more efficient models at the end of the existing equip- ment’s useful lifetime. Ü States and cities can use zoning laws, building codes, and incentives to encourage energy- efficient buildings, discourage sprawl, and provide low-emissions transportation alternatives. Ü Because past emissions have committed the region and the world to some unavoidable level of global warming over the next several decades, decision makers in the Northeast must help vulnerable constituencies adapt to the consequences. Informed policies and actions can reduce exposure to climate risks (such as catastrophic flooding) and increase the ability of vulnerable sectors and communities to cope with climate change and recover after extreme events or disasters. Ü For each adaptation measure considered, policy makers and resource managers must carefully assess the potential barriers, costs, and unintended social and environmental consequences. Ü These strategies for confronting climate change in the Northeast can also advance other widely shared regional goals such as enhancing energy security, creating jobs, producing cleaner air, and building a more sustainable economy. The costs of delay are high—the time to act is now.106 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST MEETING THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE 107 INTRODUCTION perience three times as many days of extreme Global warming is already affecting the economy, heat by late-century as they do now. lifestyles, and traditions of the Northeast, and the (cid:37)(cid:3) Lobster (which may become more productive in impacts of a changing climate will grow more northern waters) is expected to disappear from substantial in the decades to come.

NNOORRTTHHEEAASSTT MEETING THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE 111 A Citizen’s Guide to Reducing Emissions in the Northeast 1. Become carbon-conscious. The problem of global warming stems from a previous lack of awareness (on every scale, from individual to societal) of our “carbon footprint” and its effect on climate. Fortunately this is rapidly changing. Individuals and families can start by using one of several publicly available carbon footprint calculators17 that will help you understand which choices make the biggest difference. 2. Drive change. For most people, choosing a vehicle (and how much they should drive it) is the biggest sin- gle opportunity to slash personal carbon emissions. Each gallon of gas we use is responsible for 25 pounds of heat-trapping emissions; better gas mileage not only reduces global warming but can also save drivers thousands of dollars at the pump over the life of the vehicle. Compare the fuel economy of the cars you are considering18 and look for fuel-efficient technologies such as hybrid engines. Drive less by making more use of public transportation, carpooling, bicycling and walking for shorter trips, and “bundling” errands to make fewer trips. 3. Look for the Energy Star label.19 When it comes time to replace household appliances, look for the Energy Star label on new models (refrigerators, freezers, furnaces, air conditioners, and water heaters use the most energy). More efficient models may cost a bit more up front, but the energy savings can pay back your extra investment within a couple of years. The Energy Star program, run by the EPA and the Department of Energy, makes it easy to identify products that rank in the top 25 percent for energy efficiency among more than 35 product categories. The program also offers a host of resources for reducing energy consumption in homes and businesses, and identifies new homes designed to use at least 30 percent less energy than construction that merely meets existing building codes. 4. Choose clean power. Well over half of the Northeast’s electricity comes from fossil fuel-fired power plants. However, consumers throughout the region (except in New Hampshire) can purchase electricity generated from renewable resources that produce no carbon emissions, including wind, hydropower, biomass, and solar. If your local utility does not offer a “green” option you can still purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) that offset fossil-fuel use by funding renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects elsewhere in the world. RECs that are “Green-e”-certified meet high standards for ensuring the projects they fund reduce heat-trap- ping emissions.20 5. Unplug an underutilized freezer or refrigerator. One of the quickest ways to reduce your global warming impact is to unplug a rarely used refrigerator or freezer. This can lower the typical family’s CO emissions nearly 2 10 percent. 6. Get a home energy audit. Take advantage of the free home energy audits offered by many utilities. Even simple measures (such as installing a programmable thermostat to replace an old mechanical unit or sealing and insulating heating and cooling ducts) can each reduce a typical family’s CO emissions about 5 percent. 2 7. Lightbulbs matter. If every U.S. household replaced one incandescent lightbulb with an energy-saving com- pact fluorescent lightbulb (CFL), we could reduce global warming pollution by more than 90 billion pounds over the life of the bulbs—the same as taking 6.3 million cars off the road. CFLs now come in all shapes and sizes, and will lower your electric bills along with your emissions. 8. Buy good wood. When buying wood products, check for labels that indicate the source of the timber. Sup- porting sustainable forest management helps conserve biodiversity and may help slow global warming too. Well-managed forests are more likely to store carbon effectively because more trees are left standing and carbon-storing soils are disturbed less. 9. Spread the word and help others. A growing movement across the country seeks to reduce individual, fam- ily, business, and community emissions while inspiring and assisting others to do the same.

Let policy makers know you are concerned about global warming. Elected officials and candidates for public office at every level need to hear from citizens.

(See the section on managing forests and agricultural lands for issues related to the sustainable use of biomass.) Ground-source heat pumps are a proven and fair- ly common, but still relatively under-utilized, option S U CC E S S S TO R I E S The University of New Hampshire in early 2006 commissioned an on-campus natural gas-fired CHP plant that now provides greater energy security for the campus along with emissions 21 percent below the previous year. In a few years a 12-mile pipeline now under construction will enable the university to fuel its CHP plant with methane collected at the regional landfill, reducing campus emissions 57 percent below 1990 levels. Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell cut the ribbon in mid-2006 at the South Park Industrial Complex in Cambria County to officially open Gamesa Corporation’s first manufacturing facility in North America for wind-turbine generator blades. More than 230 people are expected to work at the new plant. The Spanish wind-energy company is investing $84 million to locate its U.S. headquarters in Philadelphia along with three other plants in the state, where additional workers will produce windmill components. In January 2007 Framingham, MA-based Staples Corporation unveiled its second rooftop solar PV system in the Northeast (at its retail distribution center in Killingly, CT). At roughly 74,000 square feet—approximately 1.5 times the size of a football field—this 433-kilowatt system is the largest of its kind in New England and provides approximately 14 percent of the facility’s annual electricity needs. The system was installed at no capital cost to Staples through a financing and power-purchase agree- ment with SunEdison. Staples currently ranks fourteenth among the more than 700 partners in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s voluntary Green Power Partnership, procuring 20 percent of its total electricity needs from renewable sources.112 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST MEETING THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE 113 capital costs, and the unfamiliarity of many build- ing owners and engineering professionals with the technology. The U.S. Department of Energy funds a national effort and several states including New York operate educational and technical-assistance pro- grams aimed at overcoming these barriers.22,23 Nuclear power currently provides about one- third of the region’s electricity without emitting CO 2 during generation. However, unresolved issues re- main about the operational safety of these plants, their vulnerability to terrorist attack, and the lack of approved long-term storage sites for nuclear waste.24,25 These concerns make it unlikely that nu- clear power generation will expand in the Northeast over the next few decades.

By using over 44,000 cubic yards of wood waste and sawdust that was once sent to the landfill, the company eliminated an annual natural gas bill of approximately $100,000. Also, a steam-turbine generator captures excess steam to provide 150 kW of electricity to the facility, which provides an additional $50,000 in savings. Installation expenses were partly supported by the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, and emissions from the wood-waste boiler are well below state and federal standards.26 In 2005 Colby College in Waterville, ME, completed a new 27,000-square-foot alumni center heated and cooled by three geothermal wells. Because the temperature of the water supplied by these wells stays consistently in the mid- to upper-50°F range, it is cool compared with ambient air temperatures in the summer and relatively warm in the winter. The annual savings over the proposed alternative, an oil-fired boiler and conventional air conditioning, was estimated at $4,400 based on 2005 energy prices.27112 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST MEETING THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE 113 and cost-effectiveness of this option is not yet well established.28 The Regional Greenhouse Opportunities for action Gas Initiative (RGGI) (cid:37)(cid:3) States can continue to improve appliance and lighting efficiency standards.

Extensive use and local sourcing of recycled steel, plastic, glass, and other materials also serves to reduce the emissions associated with this major development.37116 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST MEETING THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE 117 and New York City’s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). More widespread use of biodiesel and CNG would offer immediate opportunities for significant emissions reductions in both urban and agricultural settings across the Northeast. (See the Renewable Energy on the Farm text box.) In contrast, ethanol offers limited climate benefits because it is currently produced primarily from corn in an energy-intensive process. This may change in the future with further development of technology for producing “cellulosic” ethanol from agricultural waste or other plant material such as willow and switchgrass.

Industry The energy consumed by industrial and manufactur- ing processes accounts for a significant proportion (12 percent) of the Northeast’s emissions. While more energy-efficient technologies and processes can certainly reduce these emissions, companies can also greatly reduce their emissions while lowering their energy expenses by making use of energy- efficient building and facility designs, on-site renew- able energy generation, and CHP systems. Industries can also lower the total energy cost of production by making more use of local sourcing, recycled raw materials, and efficient transportation systems.

Each constituency is unique in the chal- lenges it faces and its ability to adapt. However, the following principles can help set priorities: 1. Monitor the changing environment. Decision makers and resource managers must keep informed about the specific consequences of global warming for their region and areas of oversight. In particu- lar, improved monitoring of both the climate and the condition of natural systems can give decision makers clearer signals about the need for action and more time to formulate appropriate adaptation strategies. 2. Track indicators of vulnerability and adaptation. Monitoring both the progress of specific adap- tation strategies and the social factors that limit a community’s ability to adapt can enable decision makers to modify adaptation strategies and improve outcomes. 3. Take the long view. Decisions with long-term implications (e.g., investments in infrastructure and cap- ital-intensive equipment, irreversible land-use choices) must be considered in the context of climate projections. 4. Consider the most vulnerable first. Climate-sensitive species, ecosystems, economic sectors, com- munities, and populations that are already heavily stressed for non-climatic reasons should be given high priority in policy and management decisions. 5. Build on and strengthen social networks. Ties between trusted individuals and organizations are an asset for adaptation at the community level and within business sectors. Strong leaders can in- spire organizations in times of difficult change, and well-connected and well-informed individuals can disseminate information that may be critical for effective adaptation. 6. Put regional assets to work. The Northeast has an enormous wealth of scientific and technological expertise in its universities and businesses that can be harnessed to improve our understanding of adaptation opportunities and challenges. 7. Improve public communication. Regular, effective communication with and engagement of the public on climate change helps build our regional capacity to adapt. 8. Act swiftly to reduce emissions. Strong, immediate action to reduce emissions, in the Northeast and globally, can slow climate change, limit its consequences, and give our society and ecosystems a better chance to successfully adapt to those changes we cannot avoid. that past policies have fostered among property likely to play an important role in helping coastal owners.

        "xiv CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST OUR CHANGING NORTHEAST CLIMATE 1 C H A P T E R O N E Our Changing Northeast Climate KE Y FINDINGS Ü The burning of fossil fuels and other human activities are increasing the levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, causing global average temperatures to rise. Ü The Northeast is already experiencing changes consistent with global warming: rising temperatures, decreasing snow cover, and earlier arrival of spring. Ü Due to emissions in the recent past, average temperatures across the Northeast are projected to rise another 2.5 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) in winter and 1.5°F to 3.5°F in summer above his- toric levels over the next several decades. The extent and severity of climate change beyond mid- century, however, will be determined by emissions choices we make now—in the North- east and around the world. Ü If emissions remain high, average temperatures across the Northeast are projected to rise, by late this century, 8°F to 12°F above historic levels in winter and 6°F to 14°F in summer. Cities across the Northeast are projected to average 20 days per summer over 100°F and some (such as Philadel- phia and Hartford, CT) could average nearly 30 such days. The length of the winter snow season could be cut in half across Maine, New Hampshire, northern New York, and Vermont. Ü Smaller climate-related changes can be expected if the world follows the lower-emissions pathway used in this assessment—typically about half the change expected under the higher- emissions scenario. By late-century, for example, average temperature is projected to increase 5°F to 8°F in winter and 3°F to 7°F in summer under the lower-emissions scenario. Most cities are projected to average only a few days over 100°F. In the northern part of the region, a decrease in the length of the winter snow season of more than 25 percent is projected. Ü Because some additional warming is inevitable, it is now essential to prepare to adapt to the changes that cannot be avoided.

        "4 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST OUR CHANGING NORTHEAST CLIMATE 5 Assessing Future Climate Change in the Northeast In order to project changes in temperature and other climate variables over the coming decades, scientists must address two key uncertainties. The first is directly related to human activity: how much CO and other heat-trapping gases will our industrial 2 and land-use activities emit over the coming cen- tury? The second is scientific in nature: how will the climate respond to these emissions (e.g., how much will temperatures rise in response to a given increase in atmospheric CO)? 2 To address the first uncertainty, the IPCC has de- veloped a set of possible futures, or scenarios, that project global levels of emissions of heat-trapping gases based on a wide range of development vari- ables including population growth, energy use, and other societal choices.11 IPCC Emissions Scenarios NECIA analyses used the IPCC’s A1fi and B1 sce- Projected carbon emissions for the IPCC SRES narios to represent possible higher- and lower-emis- scenarios.12 The higher-emissions scenario (A1fi) sions choices, respectively, over the course of the corresponds to the dotted red line while the lower- century.

Global climate models produce output in the form of geographic grid-based projections of daily, monthly, and annual temperatures, precipitation, winds, cloud cover, humidity, and a host of other climate variables. The grid cells range in size from 50 to 250 miles on a side. To transform these global projections into “higher-resolution” regional projec- tions (which look at changes occurring across tens of miles rather than hundreds) NECIA scientists used well-established statistical and dynamical downscal- ing techniques.15,16 Uncertainties in climate modeling and the work- ings of the earth-atmosphere system remain.

This acceleration is caused by two different mechanisms related to increasing temperatures: thermal expan- sion of seawater as it warms and increasing inflow of water from melting ice sheets and glaciers.

        "14 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST COASTAL IMPACTS 15 C H A P T E R T W O Coastal Impacts KE Y FINDINGS Ü By the end of this century, global sea level is projected to rise 7 to 14 inches under the lower- emissions scenario and 10 to 23 inches under the higher-emissions scenario used in this study. Several lines of evidence indicate that these projections may be quite conservative. Ü Even under these projections, many areas of the densely populated Northeast coast face substantial increases in the extent and frequency of coastal flooding and are at increased risk of severe storm-related damage. — Boston and Atlantic City, for example, can expect a coastal flood equivalent to today’s 100-year flood every two to four years on average by mid-century and almost annually by the end of the century. — New York City is projected to face flooding equivalent to today’s 100-year flood once every decade on average under the higher-emissions scenario and once every two decades under the lower-emissions scenario by century’s end. Ü Sea-level rise is also projected to permanently inundate low-lying coastal areas and increase shoreline erosion and wetland loss. The areas most vulnerable to shoreline erosion include portions of Cape Cod, Long Island, and most of coastal New Jersey. Ü Because of the erosive impact of waves (especially storm waves), the extent of shoreline retreat and wetland loss is projected to be many times greater than the loss of land caused by the rise in sea level itself. Ü The high concentration of population, property, infrastructure, and economic activity in coastal areas of the Northeast create considerable challenges for emergency response, hazard mitigation, and land-use planning. Combined with the conservative nature of these sea-level rise projections, these factors leave little room for delay or complacency in reducing heat-trapping emissions and adapting to rising sea levels.

        "28 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST COASTAL IMPACTS 29 COASTAL ADAPTATION As beaches retreat, wetlands disappear, and storm damage becomes more severe, coastal develop- ment and infrastructure will face increasing threats, regional tourism and fishing industries could suf- fer, and the insurance industry will increasingly be called upon to buffer the economic losses. On the other hand, loss of beach in one area may result in the shifting of sand to another beach close by, and communities and industry may be able to adapt to these changes over the long term—but not without enormous financial and social costs. As the IPCC points out, the current level of adap- tation among North American coastal communities to historic and expected sea-level rise is uneven, and readiness for increased exposure is low.71 Options for managing climate-change risks are constrained by past development and land-use patterns as well as current coastal laws and regulations, and the expec- tations they have fostered among coastal property owners. Coastal managers are faced with the difficult challenge of adapting regulations to protect against increasing risks rather than historic risks. As noted above, Maine is furthest along in tackling this chal- lenge because it has implemented shoreline regula- tions that take future sea-level rise into account. The insurance industry can help distribute cli- mate-change risks so the burden is shared by the many rather than just the few. For this industry, global warming represents both new perils and new business opportunities. (See the text box on coast- al insurance.) The Northeast, being a center of the U.S. insurance industry, has an opportunity to play a leading role in shaping the industry’s response to climate change. Public education about the region’s changing exposure to risk will need to be increased and linked to strict enforcement of building codes and land- use regulations, may require mandatory insurance coverage, and involve other activities that minimize risk. Continued and enhanced access to insurance, as well as long-term mitigation loans and subsi- dies, will play a critical role in protecting particularly vulnerable people living in high-risk areas.

Commercial fish and shellfish including cod, lobster, sea scallops, and Gulf of Maine shrimp have water-temperature thresholds that define the conditions within which they can successfully reproduce, grow, and survive to “recruitment” (i.e., when they are large enough to harvest). Sizable stocks of these species are not typi- cally found in waters that fail to meet such thermal requirements. Therefore, the warming projected over the course of this century may lead to a loss of tradi- tional, high-value species in some areas, while lob- ster populations in much of the Gulf of Maine may benefit. Global warming may also drive complex shifts in ocean circulation, nutrient supplies, plank- ton production, and other factors that shape marine ecosystems in ways that are difficult to predict.

Some changes in Arctic climate and the strength of different currents that exchange waters between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic have been linked to a shift in plankton abundance in the Gulf of Maine and on Georges Bank, with cascading effects for marine life in these waters.7 Present scientific models, however, cannot project changes in these ocean current systems.

Many of the weakened lobsters were afflicted with paramoebiasis, a potentially fatal condition caused by a parasite.61 Although the dockside value of the lobster fishery in the southern part of the Northeast has historically been modest compared with states to the north (in 1998, prior to the Long Island Sound Lobstering: A Lucrative but Precarious Way of Life die-off, combined lobster landings in Connecticut, The American lobster is one of the Northeast’s most valuable commercial New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island represented catches—Maine lobstermen alone hauled in more than 70 million pounds 23 percent of the Northeast total), the sharp decline of lobster worth $311 million in 2005.

        "46 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST IMPACTS ON FORESTS 47 C H A P T E R F O U R Impacts on Forests KE Y FINDINGS Ü The character of the Northeast’s forests may change dramatically over the coming century as the center of suitable habitat for most of the region’s tree species shifts northward—as much as 500 miles by late-century under the higher-emissions scenario, and as much as 350 miles under the lower-emissions scenario. Ü Many tree species, including the hardwoods that generate the region’s brilliant fall foliage, may be able to persist this century even as their optimal climate zones shift northward. Other species, however, may succumb to climate stress, increased competition, and other pressures. Ü If the higher-emissions scenario prevails, productivity of spruce/fir forests is expected to decline and suitable habitat will all but disappear from the Northeast by the end of the century. Major losses are projected even under the lower-emissions scenario. This would greatly exacerbate stresses on the pulp and paper industry in the Northeast, particularly in Maine, where the forest-based manufacturing industry is key to the state’s economy. Ü Diminished spruce/fir habitat, especially at higher elevations, would increase pressure on associated animal species such as the snowshoe hare, Canada lynx, and Bicknell’s thrush, one of the region’s prized songbirds. With the late-century summer warming projected under the higher-emissions scenario, suitable habitat for the Bicknell’s thrush could be eliminated from the region. Ü Substantial changes in bird life are expected across the Northeast due to rising temperatures, shifting distribution of suitable habitat, or declining habitat quality. The greatest changes are projected under the higher-emissions scenario, including declines in the abundance of many migratory songbirds such as the American goldfinch, song sparrow, and Baltimore oriole. Ü Winter warming will threaten hemlock stands, not only by reducing suitable habitat for these trees, but also by allowing northward expansion of a fatal pest known as the hemlock woolly adelgid—as far north as Canada by late-century under the higher-emissions scenario.

Since the late 1990s, more than one-third of Maine’s land, for example, has changed ownership.6,7 About 6 million forested acres across the northern Northeast states have been sold in this same period. Some of North America’s most complex mix- tures of tree species occur in the Northeast, where the more boreal forests to the north transition to the more temperate hardwood forests to the south.8 Climate change is not expected to cause a net loss of forested land, but it is projected to alter the char- acter of the region’s forests over the coming century. Some current forest types would give way to new forest types that will have combinations of species different from those we know today. The forest types that characterize various parts of the Northeast are defined by their major con- stituent tree species: for example, white/red/jack pine, oak/hickory, spruce/fir, or maple/birch/beech. Each species within these forests has unique habitat requirements. Climate plays a major role in deter- mining suitable habitat for trees (i.e., where indi- vidual tree species can establish themselves, grow, and survive). It also has a significant effect on how quickly trees grow and how entire forest ecosystems function (in terms of how they cycle water and nutri- ents).

As winters continue to warm over the coming century, forest soils will remain frozen for shorter periods, freeze less deeply, or potentially not freeze at all in more southerly areas. The industry may be able to cope by investing in timber harvesting equipment currently employed in other parts of the country where soils do not freeze. However, switching to new equipment can be ex- pensive, and minimizing the economic impact will require that timber managers carefully weigh when climate changes are clear enough to warrant an im- mediate investment rather than waiting to upgrade as part of normal equipment turnover.

        "56 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST IMPACTS ON FORESTS 57 Concerns over Native Coldwater Fish In the centuries since European colonization of the Northeast began, native freshwater fish communi- ties have lost habitat or suffered from habitat degra- dation caused by human activities such as logging, agriculture, and the stocking of many lakes and streams with non-native brown trout, rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, and other popular sport fish that prey on and compete with native species such as brook trout. Acid rain, suburban sprawl, and the “channelization” of streams have further reduced na- tive populations in recent decades.32 Now global warming adds a new threat to the survival of native coldwater species, as warmer conditions across the Northeast increase water temperatures, reduce win- ter snow and ice cover, and alter the timing, dura- tion, and volume of seasonal stream flow.33,34,35 These species, including brook trout, lake trout, Atlantic salmon, and several types of whitefish, are described as “coldwater” fish because they generally require year-round access to water temperatures below 70°F. Summer temperatures in many north- ern streams and lakes have already risen beyond that threshold,36 but native stream fish have con- tinued to thrive due to the presence of small cold- water refuges such as tributaries and areas where groundwater enters a stream. Similarly, most north- ern lakes deeper than 30 feet “stratify” during the summer, a process that insulates water near the bottom from the warm air and provides a thermal refuge for lake fish.

All major coldwater species, for example, spawn in late fall and spend the winter on the bottom of lakes and rivers, where they are usually insulated from severe cold and protected from storms by surface ice. The pre- dictable onset and duration of ice cover are linked to the timing of egg hatching and larval feeding, which in turn determine the success of coldwater fish such as lake trout and lake whitefish.49 Warmer winters with less consistent ice formation could threaten the survival of these species in northern lakes. Predictable seasonal changes in stream flow also provide important cues for fish. For example, egg hatching is timed so that young fish can quickly seek refuge from the strong flow generated by spring snowmelt. Large changes in the timing of peak spring flow have already been measured in the last Will Fewer Native Fish Be Biting? 50 years50 and are projected to continue as winters Many residents of the Northeast, young and old, enjoy warm, potentially disrupting this survival strategy.

In the Northeast global warming is projected to affect water resources in the following ways.1,2 • Alter the timing and amount of stream flow, which would create: – more high-flow events in winter, particularly under the higher-emissions scenario, with an associated risk of winter flooding; – earlier peak flows in spring—roughly two weeks earlier under the higher-emissions scenario and 10 days earlier under the lower-emissions scenario; and – extended low-flow periods in summer—nearly a month longer by late-century under the higher- emissions scenario, with little change under the lower-emissions scenario. • Increase winter precipitation (much of which is expected to fall as rain) 20 to 30 percent by late-century under either emissions scenario. • Reduce snowpack and shorten the snow season in the typically snowy northern states— up to 50 percent by late-century under the higher-emissions scenario and more than 25 percent under the lower-emissions scenario. • Increase the frequency of short-term (one- to three-month) droughts3 by late-century from an average of once every two to three years to once every year across the Adirondacks, Catskills, and most of New England under the higher-emissions scenario, with little change under the lower-emissions scenario. • Increase the frequency of extremely hot days (which can increase water demand) roughly five-fold under the higher-emissions scenario and two- to three-fold under the lower-emissions scenario. • Increase the likelihood and severity of damaging rainstorms under both scenarios. • Raise sea levels between 10 and 23 inches under the higher-emissions scenario and 7 and 14 inches under the lower-emissions scenario, increasing the risk of saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers.",

        "66 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST IMPACTS ON AGRICULTURE 67 C H A P T E R F I V E Impacts on Agriculture KE Y FINDINGS Ü Farmers in the Northeast will face increasing uncertainty and risk as they attempt to adapt to the effects of climate change. Ü A longer growing season may allow farmers to experiment with new crops, but many traditional farm operations in the region will become unsustainable without adaptation strategies that could be quite costly in some cases. Ü Without adaptation measures, increasing summer heat stress is projected, by mid-century, to depress milk production and the yields of a number of economically important crops across southern parts of the region, particularly under the higher-emissions scenario. By late-century under this scenario, milk production across much of the region could decline 5 to 20 percent in certain months, with the greatest losses in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. By contrast, little change is expected under the lower-emissions scenario. Ü Parts of the Northeast are projected to become unsuitable for growing certain popular varieties of apples, blueberries, and cranberries by mid-century, since they require long winter-chill periods to produce fruit. Ü European wine grapes are expected to benefit from warmer winters, but yields of native grape varieties such as the Concord are projected to decline. Ü Weed problems and pest-related damage are likely to escalate, increasing pressures on farmers to use more herbicides and pesticides. Ü An increasing number of storms producing heavy rainfall may delay spring planting and damage crops and soils, while more frequent droughts during the growing season—particularly under the higher-emissions scenario—could make irrigation essential for most high-value crops. Ü By late-century many of these trends are projected to be highly pronounced across most of the Northeast under the higher-emissions scenario, but more constrained in magnitude and geographic extent under the lower-emissions scenario.

Global warming will negatively affect dairy and other livestock op- erations by increasing the intensity and frequency of summer heat stress, which can depress both milk production and birthing rates in dairy cows for weeks or even months. The optimal temperature for milk production ranges from 40°F to 75°F, depending on the humidity; for example, heat stress can occur at temperatures as low as 75°F when the relative hu- midity is 65 percent or higher, but at temperatures of 80°F, heat stress requires relative humidity of only 30 percent.7 Heat stress already causes an estimated $2.4 Higher Temperatures Depress Milk Production billion in annual losses to U.S. livestock industries.8 Dairy cows are sprayed with water to keep them cool.

        "80 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST IMPACTS ON WINTER RECREATION 81 C H A P T E R S I X Impacts on Winter Recreation KE Y FINDINGS Ü Global warming is projected to profoundly affect winter recreation and tourism in the Northeast as winter temperatures continue to rise and snow cover declines, especially under the higher- emissions scenario. Ü Snowmobiling is the most vulnerable of the region’s economically important winter recreation activities because, unlike the ski industry, it cannot rely on machine-made snow. Within the next several decades, snowmobiling opportunities are projected to become virtually non-existent in Pennsylvania and western and southeastern New York under either emissions scenario used in this assessment. Ü By late-century, average season length across the region is projected to decline to 13 days under the higher-emissions scenario, an 80 percent decline below recent levels, and to 25 days under the lower-emissions scenario, a 57 percent decline. Only northern New Hampshire would retain a snowmobile season longer than two months if higher emissions prevail. Ü Warmer winters would also shorten the average ski and snowboard seasons, increase snow- making requirements, and drive up operating costs (particularly under the higher-emissions scenario). This may prompt further closures and consolidation of ski areas northward toward the Canadian border. Ü Under the higher-emissions scenario, only the northern New England states and the North Country of New York are projected to support viable ski operations by mid-century. By the latter part of the century, only western Maine is projected to retain a reliable ski season under the higher-emissions scenario. Ü Under the lower-emissions scenario, reliable ski seasons can be expected through this century in the North Country of New York and parts of Vermont and New Hampshire, in addition to western Maine. Ü These projections may be conservative, as the climate models used in this analysis have consistently underestimated the rapid winter warming and snowpack decline observed in recent decades.

        "84 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST IMPACTS ON WINTER RECREATION 85 Ice Fishing: A Threatened Tradition Ice fishing derbies are a winter institution in parts of the Northeast, bringing well-bundled anglers out to drill holes through the ice of frozen lakes and wait for perch, pickerel, pike, bass, trout, or tiger muskie. But the Northeast’s winters—and its ice fishing—are not what they used to be. In 2007 the New York State Crappie Derby was canceled for the second year in a row because the ice on Whitney Point Lake in mid-January was so thin that the contest’s sponsors feared for anglers’ safety. A similar fate befell that year’s Berkshire Wild Turkey Federation Derby on Lake Buel in western Massachusetts, while many others were postponed into February.18,19,20 As winters have warmed over the past century, the duration of ice cover on the region’s lakes has decreased. “Ice-in” dates (when the majority of a lake or pond has frozen over) have been occurring later in winter while ice-out dates (when ice cover has largely melted) are arriving earlier in spring. The duration of ice cover on southern Maine’s Se- bago Lake, for example, has declined by two weeks since the mid-nineteenth century, and the rate of decline has accelerated over the past 25 years. In addition, the once-rare years when Sebago Lake fails to freeze at all are occurring more frequently.

Some snowmobiling enthusiasts may switch to ATVs, which are not dependent on snow conditions. In the past five years U.S. ATV sales have grown while snowmobile sales have declined, suggesting that the transition is already under way in some regions. A large switch from snowmobiling to ATV use would have important implications for land managers and communities in the Northeast since ATVs tend to have far more damaging impacts on vegetation and recreational trails. Some snowmobiling-dependent communities are already debating whether to allow ATVs on snowmobile trails in low- or no-snow years.23 Concerns about snowmobiling apply, to a cer- tain extent, to other activities that depend almost entirely on natural snow cover, such as cross-country Snowmaking Needs and Costs to Increase skiing, sledding, and snowshoeing.

Ü Under the higher-emissions scenario, for example, Pittsburgh and the Concord/Manchester area of New Hampshire could each experience roughly 25 days over 100°F every summer by the end of the century, and typically cooler cities such as Buffalo could average 14 such days. Ü Global warming could worsen air pollution in the Northeast, creating more days when national air-quality standards cannot be met (particularly under the higher-emissions scenario). Deteriorating air quality would exacerbate the risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, and other ailments in states such as Massachusetts, which already has the highest rate of adult asthma in the United States. Ü In the Philadelphia metropolitan region, for example, the number of days failing to meet the federal ozone standard is expected to at least quadruple by late-century under the higher- emissions scenario if local vehicle and industrial emissions of ozone-forming pollutants are not reduced. Ü Rising temperature and CO levels could worsen pollen-based allergies across the Northeast, 2 particularly under the higher-emissions scenario.

Reducing people’s expo- sure to climate-related risks can be addressed, for ex- ample, through raising awareness of heat- or flood- related risks, evacuating people from floodplains, preventing development in hazardous areas when possible, and providing access to spaces for cool- ing off during prolonged periods of extreme heat. Focusing on populations and communities that are particularly vulnerable to climate-related hazards, such as the elderly during heat waves, would ad- dress sensitivity to risk.

Ü Concerted action to reduce emissions in the Northeast—on the order of 80 percent below 2000 levels by mid-century and just over 3 percent per year on average over the next few decades— can help pull global emissions below the lower-emissions scenario described here. As both a world leader in technology, finance, and innovation and a major source of heat-trapping emissions, the Northeast is well positioned to help drive national and international progress toward this goal. Ü The Northeast’s decision makers—from individual households to industry and government— have myriad options available today for reducing emissions from each of the region’s four major sources of CO : electric power, buildings, transportation, and industry. 2 Ü Consumers and policy makers at all levels can accelerate the region’s transition from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy resources (including solar, wind, and geothermal) through energy choices supported by market incentives and regulations. Ü Energy users can significantly curb emissions by embracing efficiency: purchasing energy- efficient lighting and small appliances and replacing vehicles, heating and cooling systems, motors, and large appliances with more efficient models at the end of the existing equip- ment’s useful lifetime. Ü States and cities can use zoning laws, building codes, and incentives to encourage energy- efficient buildings, discourage sprawl, and provide low-emissions transportation alternatives. Ü Because past emissions have committed the region and the world to some unavoidable level of global warming over the next several decades, decision makers in the Northeast must help vulnerable constituencies adapt to the consequences. Informed policies and actions can reduce exposure to climate risks (such as catastrophic flooding) and increase the ability of vulnerable sectors and communities to cope with climate change and recover after extreme events or disasters. Ü For each adaptation measure considered, policy makers and resource managers must carefully assess the potential barriers, costs, and unintended social and environmental consequences. Ü These strategies for confronting climate change in the Northeast can also advance other widely shared regional goals such as enhancing energy security, creating jobs, producing cleaner air, and building a more sustainable economy. The costs of delay are high—the time to act is now.",

NNOORRTTHHEEAASSTT MEETING THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE 111 A Citizen’s Guide to Reducing Emissions in the Northeast 1. Become carbon-conscious. The problem of global warming stems from a previous lack of awareness (on every scale, from individual to societal) of our “carbon footprint” and its effect on climate. Fortunately this is rapidly changing. Individuals and families can start by using one of several publicly available carbon footprint calculators17 that will help you understand which choices make the biggest difference. 2. Drive change. For most people, choosing a vehicle (and how much they should drive it) is the biggest sin- gle opportunity to slash personal carbon emissions. Each gallon of gas we use is responsible for 25 pounds of heat-trapping emissions; better gas mileage not only reduces global warming but can also save drivers thousands of dollars at the pump over the life of the vehicle. Compare the fuel economy of the cars you are considering18 and look for fuel-efficient technologies such as hybrid engines. Drive less by making more use of public transportation, carpooling, bicycling and walking for shorter trips, and “bundling” errands to make fewer trips. 3. Look for the Energy Star label.19 When it comes time to replace household appliances, look for the Energy Star label on new models (refrigerators, freezers, furnaces, air conditioners, and water heaters use the most energy). More efficient models may cost a bit more up front, but the energy savings can pay back your extra investment within a couple of years. The Energy Star program, run by the EPA and the Department of Energy, makes it easy to identify products that rank in the top 25 percent for energy efficiency among more than 35 product categories. The program also offers a host of resources for reducing energy consumption in homes and businesses, and identifies new homes designed to use at least 30 percent less energy than construction that merely meets existing building codes. 4. Choose clean power. Well over half of the Northeast’s electricity comes from fossil fuel-fired power plants. However, consumers throughout the region (except in New Hampshire) can purchase electricity generated from renewable resources that produce no carbon emissions, including wind, hydropower, biomass, and solar. If your local utility does not offer a “green” option you can still purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) that offset fossil-fuel use by funding renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects elsewhere in the world. RECs that are “Green-e”-certified meet high standards for ensuring the projects they fund reduce heat-trap- ping emissions.20 5. Unplug an underutilized freezer or refrigerator. One of the quickest ways to reduce your global warming impact is to unplug a rarely used refrigerator or freezer. This can lower the typical family’s CO emissions nearly 2 10 percent. 6. Get a home energy audit. Take advantage of the free home energy audits offered by many utilities. Even simple measures (such as installing a programmable thermostat to replace an old mechanical unit or sealing and insulating heating and cooling ducts) can each reduce a typical family’s CO emissions about 5 percent. 2 7. Lightbulbs matter. If every U.S. household replaced one incandescent lightbulb with an energy-saving com- pact fluorescent lightbulb (CFL), we could reduce global warming pollution by more than 90 billion pounds over the life of the bulbs—the same as taking 6.3 million cars off the road. CFLs now come in all shapes and sizes, and will lower your electric bills along with your emissions. 8. Buy good wood. When buying wood products, check for labels that indicate the source of the timber. Sup- porting sustainable forest management helps conserve biodiversity and may help slow global warming too. Well-managed forests are more likely to store carbon effectively because more trees are left standing and carbon-storing soils are disturbed less. 9. Spread the word and help others. A growing movement across the country seeks to reduce individual, fam- ily, business, and community emissions while inspiring and assisting others to do the same. The Empower- ment Institute based in Woodstock, NY, sponsors a “Cool Community Campaign” featuring a “Low Carbon Diet” study guide; you and other members of your local community can use this resource to help achieve energy savings and emissions reductions.21 10. Let policy makers know you are concerned about global warming. Elected officials and candidates for public office at every level need to hear from citizens. Urge them to support policies and funding choices that will accelerate the shift to a low-emissions future.",

Ground-source heat pumps are a proven and fair- ly common, but still relatively under-utilized, option S U CC E S S S TO R I E S The University of New Hampshire in early 2006 commissioned an on-campus natural gas-fired CHP plant that now provides greater energy security for the campus along with emissions 21 percent below the previous year. In a few years a 12-mile pipeline now under construction will enable the university to fuel its CHP plant with methane collected at the regional landfill, reducing campus emissions 57 percent below 1990 levels. Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell cut the ribbon in mid-2006 at the South Park Industrial Complex in Cambria County to officially open Gamesa Corporation’s first manufacturing facility in North America for wind-turbine generator blades. More than 230 people are expected to work at the new plant. The Spanish wind-energy company is investing $84 million to locate its U.S. headquarters in Philadelphia along with three other plants in the state, where additional workers will produce windmill components. In January 2007 Framingham, MA-based Staples Corporation unveiled its second rooftop solar PV system in the Northeast (at its retail distribution center in Killingly, CT). At roughly 74,000 square feet—approximately 1.5 times the size of a football field—this 433-kilowatt system is the largest of its kind in New England and provides approximately 14 percent of the facility’s annual electricity needs. The system was installed at no capital cost to Staples through a financing and power-purchase agree- ment with SunEdison. Staples currently ranks fourteenth among the more than 700 partners in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s voluntary Green Power Partnership, procuring 20 percent of its total electricity needs from renewable sources.",

By using over 44,000 cubic yards of wood waste and sawdust that was once sent to the landfill, the company eliminated an annual natural gas bill of approximately $100,000. Also, a steam-turbine generator captures excess steam to provide 150 kW of electricity to the facility, which provides an additional $50,000 in savings. Installation expenses were partly supported by the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, and emissions from the wood-waste boiler are well below state and federal standards.26 In 2005 Colby College in Waterville, ME, completed a new 27,000-square-foot alumni center heated and cooled by three geothermal wells. Because the temperature of the water supplied by these wells stays consistently in the mid- to upper-50°F range, it is cool compared with ambient air temperatures in the summer and relatively warm in the winter. The annual savings over the proposed alternative, an oil-fired boiler and conventional air conditioning, was estimated at $4,400 based on 2005 energy prices.27",

        "124 CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST MEETING THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE 125 How to Prioritize Adaptation Strategies The various strategies with which states, business sectors, and communities in the Northeast can prepare for climate change must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Each constituency is unique in the chal- lenges it faces and its ability to adapt. However, the following principles can help set priorities: 1. Monitor the changing environment. Decision makers and resource managers must keep informed about the specific consequences of global warming for their region and areas of oversight. In particu- lar, improved monitoring of both the climate and the condition of natural systems can give decision makers clearer signals about the need for action and more time to formulate appropriate adaptation strategies. 2. Track indicators of vulnerability and adaptation. Monitoring both the progress of specific adap- tation strategies and the social factors that limit a community’s ability to adapt can enable decision makers to modify adaptation strategies and improve outcomes. 3. Take the long view. Decisions with long-term implications (e.g., investments in infrastructure and cap- ital-intensive equipment, irreversible land-use choices) must be considered in the context of climate projections. 4. Consider the most vulnerable first. Climate-sensitive species, ecosystems, economic sectors, com- munities, and populations that are already heavily stressed for non-climatic reasons should be given high priority in policy and management decisions. 5. Build on and strengthen social networks. Ties between trusted individuals and organizations are an asset for adaptation at the community level and within business sectors. Strong leaders can in- spire organizations in times of difficult change, and well-connected and well-informed individuals can disseminate information that may be critical for effective adaptation. 6. Put regional assets to work. The Northeast has an enormous wealth of scientific and technological expertise in its universities and businesses that can be harnessed to improve our understanding of adaptation opportunities and challenges. 7. Improve public communication. Regular, effective communication with and engagement of the public on climate change helps build our regional capacity to adapt. 8. Act swiftly to reduce emissions. Strong, immediate action to reduce emissions, in the Northeast and globally, can slow climate change, limit its consequences, and give our society and ecosystems a better chance to successfully adapt to those changes we cannot avoid. that past policies have fostered among property likely to play an important role in helping coastal owners.
