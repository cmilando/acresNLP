It is hard to im- agine such a statutory liability scheme making its way through Congress, irre- spective of the underlying problem it sought to address. A snapshot of the historical, legal, and political context of CERCLA’s passage in 1980 has the potential to guide future efforts at national policymaking through the imposi- tion of corporate liability. Now, the world confronts another watershed moment in environmental history, and past actors face a potential flood of liability. Tort cases in jurisdic- tions across the nation assert that the fossil fuel industry must compensate the public entities already footing the bill for climate adaptation.2 The potential for disparate results in these cases over the next decade threatens to undermine the necessary infrastructure improvements they seek to facilitate. As with the toxic contamination plaguing the country at mid-century, citizens have taken notice of the harms at their doorsteps and underequipped local governments have been forced to lead the response.3 Back then, the accumulated harm bubbled up in punctuated disasters, and the federal government responded by enacting CER- CLA in 1980 to bring some order to what had been disjointed, ineffective efforts to clean up contamination across the country. The federal government can wait for some climate-induced disaster to prompt similar action, or, draw- ing on lessons from CERCLA, act swiftly to draft and pass what this work calls a “Climate Adaptation Resilience and Liability Act” or “CARLA.” Much of the situation is different in 2023 from that in 1980. However, some important legal, political, and practical elements today mirror those that paved the way for CERCLA’s passage. A statutory scheme for climate liability thus could serve as an important feature of climate adaptation policy as we move further into a century punctuated by the harsh realities of a changed cli- mate. The focus on adaptation strategies (e.g., infrastructure improvements and land use changes in coastal communities)4 rather than punitive damages (i.e., penalties) makes the CARLA-CERCLA parallel apt. As with cleanup costs, adaptation costs are necessary to protect human and environmental health; someone must bear them. CARLA, like CERCLA before it, would efficiently 2. See infra Part II. 3.

Both torts theory and climate policy support a statutory scheme that im- poses liability for climate adaptation costs on fossil fuel producers. For almost two decades, torts scholars have discussed the application of various theories of liability—nuisance, trespass, negligence, and more—to the emission of green- house gases (“GHGs”).5 Much of that work argues that traditional principles of public nuisance justify injunctive relief to cap further emissions of defendant polluters and monetary damages to compensate those already harmed by the climate crisis.6 The arguments for those remedies on that tort theory provoked the first iteration of climate change torts cases against emitters of greenhouse gases in federal courts. In American Electric Power v. Connecticut7 and Native Village of Kivalina v. Exxon Mobil Corp.,8 the courts promptly shut the doors on that line of cases––though importantly without rejecting the theoretical appli- cation of torts principles to climate harms. The second generation of climate change torts cases have focused on the potential state law liability of the compa- 5.

The underlying torts justification for these cases is sound from both an instru- mentalist and corrective justice perspective. Put simply (and discussed in more detail infra), holding fossil fuel companies liable for adaptation costs internal- izes the externality these companies imposed upon society. Forcing them to bear that expense will both disincentivize further ubiquitous production and sale of fossil fuels and punish them for their prior bad acts. The former is an instrumental goal while the latter is a corrective justice goal. From the perspec- tive of climate policy, many have long maintained that some form of carbon tax presents the most efficient way to address both the sources and the effects of climate change.11 Liability for adaptation, particularly if streamlined and regu- larized by federal statute, would serve a very similar function in terms of align- ing economic incentives with climate mitigation policy. And focusing that liability on the relatively few actors who provide the root source of the green- house gas problem is the most efficient manner of creating those incentives. Furthermore, the necessity of adaptation, in addition to mitigation, is no longer a question for climate policymakers. The only question now is how much of it we will need and who will pay for it.12 A statutory adaptation liability scheme would answer that crucial second part of the policy equation. 9. See Karen C. Sokol, Seeking (Some) Climate Justice in State Tort Law, 95 WASH. L.

See SHI-LING HSU, THE CASEFORA CARBON TAX: GETTING PAST OUR HANG-UPSTO EFFECTIVE CLIMATE POLICY 27 (2011) (discussing how a carbon tax would be a “Pigouvian” tax, “a unitary tax levied to make an emitter pay for the externalities caused by its emissions.” This type of tax could potentially “induce just the right amount of carbon dioxide emissions reductions.”). 12. It should be noted that, unfortunately, national politics have seemingly regressed on the question of the necessity of addressing climate change through mitigation or adaptation over the past two decades. Many in Congress remain skeptical of the need to take action. See Justin Worland, Climate Change Used to Be a Bipartisan Issue. Here’s What Changed, TIME, July 27, 2017, https://perma.cc/JA7G-34UP. That lack of consensus, however, does not re- flect the reality of the oncoming costs; the IPCC has observed adaptation already increasing and made clear (with “high confidence”) that more adaptation costs will be incurred.

It will do so by comparison to the paradigmatic example of statutory environmental liability – CERCLA. The first part looks at the parallel historical contexts in the early 1980s and the early 2020s. The second part explains why, just as with contami- nated property forty years ago, the torts system, without statutory uniformity, will prove an inefficient and inadequate solution to the crisis of environmental harm we currently face. The third part expands upon the affirmative case for CARLA from practical and theoretical perspectives. Finally, the work explains how three features came to define CERCLA liability—strict, joint and several, and retroactive—and how those features should function in CARLA. I. THE EARLY 1980S AND THE EARLY 2020S A. The 1980s Liability for destructive and harmful waste management did not manifest out of thin air in the late 1970s. The environmental movement of that decade simply brought new attention to an age-old problem. Records indicate that medieval common law courts in England recognized that release and disposal of waste may lead to a trespass cause of action.13 The moral obligation to clean up the pollution one causes dates back even further.14 Nonetheless, formal litiga- tion advancing these principles in the corporate context occurred relatively in- frequently in twentieth century America. It was not, as one might expect, a renewed surge in actual tort cases, but rather theoretical liability, that prompted federal attention to the problem in the late 1970s. Prior to the passage of CERCLA, tort litigation seeking compensatory or injunctive relief based on contamination of property by hazardous wastes was rare. The relevant reported cases from that time primarily involve the cleanup of oil spilled in or near drinking water supplies.15 Even cases seeking personal injury damages based on exposure to hazardous substances, so-called “toxic 13.

As that doctrine matured over time, courts defined increasingly narrowly the cate- gory of “abnormally dangerous activities” to which strict liability attached, re- sponding to a variety of efficiency-related arguments.18 Sites contaminated by hazardous waste still needed cleaning up, which was bound to be costly. In this area, legal and other transaction costs had the potential to dwarf the underlying problem and slow the necessary response. CERCLA provided a vehicle for consistency and cost allocation. The history of strict liability after CERCLA’s passage confirms the trajectory of the common law in this area of torts. As strict liability became commonplace for hazardous waste disposal under interpreta- tions of CERCLA, courts became more reluctant to impose strict liability for property damage caused by dangerous activities outside of the statutory scheme. By 1983, just three years after CERCLA’s passage, a report of the Superfund Study Group conducted under section 301(e) of CERCLA to evaluate the ade- quacy of existing common law and statutory remedies had concluded that a private litigant faces substantial barriers to recovery for property damage and personal injury.19 The state of the common law around CERCLA’s passage only partially set the table. The United States Congress had just completed a decade of environ- mental lawmaking (the famous 1970s); the decade that would come to define 16.

In practice, most states avoided the area of law. For example, prior to the Clean Air Act’s passage, although motor vehicle emissions were a known pollutant, only Cali- fornia took advantage of the jurisdictional opening by adopting new vehicle regulations in 1960. What’s more, the predecessors to the Clean Air Act of 197021 included several provisions that specifically provided opportunities for states to become involved in the regulation and control of interstate air pollu- tion, but the states largely declined the invitation.22 These included the oppor- tunity to associate in interstate compacts,23 to form interstate air quality control agencies in federally designated regions,24 and to set air quality standards for these regions.25 The story of lead paint regulation followed a similar pattern. The majority of states avoided the issue26 until the federal government stepped in and banned lead-based paint in the 1970s.27 Tort litigation under the common law was similarly rare following the federal ban, considered only by “activists” and ulti- 20.

However, many of these early attempts by local and state gov- ernments to regulate environmental harms were frustrated by the ease with which another city or state could undercut regulations and attract business, su- percharged by the ability of a single industry to overwhelm a single locality.31 This largely explains why many of the earliest federal laws simply provided financial assistance to states to support their governments in the face of corpo- rate resistance and potential economic pain.32 When that approach did not bear the desired fruit of cleaner environments, at least some state and local officials joined the push to pressure the federal government to step in more aggres- sively.33 Thus, pressure on the federal government to consolidate regulations 28.

CERCLA was the last big piece of the pollution control picture. It tried to answer the question of who should clean up the mess from the preceding era of unregulated industrial activity. The rise of the chemical industry and the increased reliance on chemical products for industrial and household use made salient the issue of human ex- posure to hazardous wastes.34 Several prominent environmental and public health incidents involving chemicals captured political attention. Most promi- nently, in the summer of 1976, twenty-five years after the Hooker Chemical Company stopped using the Love Canal as an industrial dump, toxic com- pounds leached into the backyards and basements of 100 homes and a public school built on the banks of the canal.35 The community demanded the federal government take action, and President Carter declared an emergency36 under the Stafford Act37 and called for swift congressional action. The Senate, specifi- cally, dug deeper into the history of toxic contamination, focusing on “three major pre-Love Canal incidents that came to national attention—the kepone contamination of the James River, the PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) con- tamination of the Hudson River, and the contamination of Michigan livestock by the ingestion of PBBs (polybrominated biphenyls).”38 And an EPA study documented the scope of the problem, cataloguing reported “hazardous mate- rial incidents” between 1977 and 1979.39 During the study period, EPA re- corded some 3,076 incidents, most of which were reported to the agency voluntarily.40 There was no question the problem was even bigger than the lim- ited data suggested. The risks of exposure to hazardous substances manifested in a wide variety of locations across the United States, affecting a wide swath of the population (if not all of it). 34. S. REP.

Although the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) prospectively addressed management and disposal of hazardous waste,41 it did nothing to deal with the thousands of existing sites already contaminated by past owners and operators, insolvent owners and oper- ators, or both. The contamination at such sites posed equal, or greater, risk to persons and property in their immediate vicinity than the risk posed by the future and ongoing hazardous waste storage, treatment, and disposal regulated by RCRA. The large number of existing hazardous waste sites could partially be attributed to the decades of under-regulation of disposal activities by state and local governments that preceded RCRA. The emergence of at least some of these environmental hazards paradoxically also resulted from the preceding dec- ade of tough regulatory statutes, RCRA among them. Increased oversight and regulation drove up compliance costs, which in turn drove many hazardous- waste-generating businesses to abandon operations. Consequently, by the end of the 1970s, the number and visibility of hazardous waste sites across the country were increasing.42 With respect to CERCLA, the nature of the problem—contaminated real property—affected both the push for federal action and the type of tool (i.e., a liability rule) selected. The importance of property ownership and accompany- ing capital and wealth accumulation feature prominently in the American story. As RCRA came into maturity, two market effects emerged. First, dealing with hazardous waste legally became more difficult and more expensive. Bad actors stored—or worse, just outright dumped—waste on their properties to avoid the complication and expense of compliance with new environmental laws and reg- ulations.43 Others who had been disposing of waste cheaply for years simply went out of business, leaving abandoned, contaminated sites in their wake.44 41. 42 U.S.C. §§6901–6908. 42. See James J. Florio, Congress as Reluctant Regulator: Hazardous Waste Policy in the 1980’s, 3 YALE J. ON REG. 351, 355 (1986) (“As Congress and the Administration learned more about past hazardous waste disposal practices and their effect on the environment, they soon realized that the country faced an environmental crisis. . . . Congress recognized that, aside from the regulatory problems addressed in RCRA, a remedial program was needed to clean up existing hazardous waste dumps. . . . In community after community, officials discovered sites where chemical wastes had been dumped in the ground for years, or even decades. The sites were simply abandoned, and in many cases the owners had disappeared. No one took responsibility for these abandoned sites, and the local, state, and federal governments had neither the legal authority nor the resources to clean them up.”). 43.

However, predictably, very few entities had any interest in acquiring them for fear of potential liability for either personal injuries or cleanup costs.45 At least with respect to allocating the latter species of liability, a federal liability statute presented an attractive solution. The congressional debate on the legislation that would eventually become CERCLA46 recognized these legal and practical realities. Starting in 1979, the United States House of Representatives introduced two separate bill packages and the Senate introduced one package. The legislative history of CERCLA itself is a conglomeration of the efforts on these predecessor bill packages, which eventually were superseded by the rather hastily constructed bipartisan compromise bill.47 The Chemical Manufacturer’s Association (“CMA”), as well as lobbyists for other industries facing potential liability, bent the ear of sympathetic lawmakers working on the proposed legislation that would become CER- CLA.48 The CMA was prominently and actively involved in negotiations over the eventual terms of CERCLA.49 Surprisingly, industry did not line up in complete opposition to a federal solution to the problem of contaminated sites. The CMA’s members opposed any increase in liability from common law prin- ciples (a point on which they ultimately lost) but had no problem with the government stepping in to help clean up so-called “orphaned” sites.50 On this latter point, for the CMA, and many members of Congress, the devil lay in the details. Everyone knew that a pot of money would need to be made available to assist with the cleanup of sites where no solvent liable party existed. Thus, a central feature of CERCLA negotiations had to do with how much money the 45. See Joel A.

The former two committees reported the bill out with no major changes about a year apart.54 The Ways and Means Committee, acting last, considered and proposed some amendments to the leg- islation.55 Of particular note, the committee marked up language around liabil- ity and added the phrase “jointly, severally and strictly liable for all damages.”56 In September of 1980, the House passed the bill with the amended language. The second House bill package, H.R. 7020,57 began in the spring of 1980 as the Hazardous Waste Containment Act. The bill proceeded to the Commit- tee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, which reported it out in the form of an amendment to RCRA that, similar to H.R. 85, imposed strict joint and several liability.58 Over in the Senate, S. 1480 was introduced and debated concurrently with the house debate of H.R. 7020.59 First introduced in the summer of 1979 as Environmental Emergency Response Act, the Senate sent the bill to the Com- mittee on Environment and Public Works, who subsequently referred it to a subcommittee, where it sat until the spring of 1980.60 The full committee marked up the proposed legislation and referred it to the Committee on Fi- 51.

The bill was introduced with an amendment that prohibits fur- ther amendments and in fact was itself a whole new bill, which was subsequently referred to as the “compromise bill.”64 Debate on the bill com- pared it to H.R. 7020, but it was not identical.65 The Senate passed the com- promise bill on Nov. 24, 1980.66 The House, then, passed the compromise bill on December 3, 1980. President Carter signed it one week later.67 Congressional debate centered on the liability provisions. A significant constituency in the House of Representatives believed strong liability provisions essential to any bill.68 From their perspective, strict, joint and several liability was an intended, central feature of the Superfund scheme.

The Senate drafters reasoned that under common law, hazardous waste disposal constituted an ultrahazardous activity subject to strict liability.70 This intent seems to have been endorsed by the case law establishing CER- CLA precedent over the following ten years.71 B. The 2020s The costs of climate adaptation will add up in the short and long term. Over just the next two decades, coastal communities on both sides of the United States will likely have to spend more than $400 billion to deal with unavoidable sea-level rise.72 Over that time, fourteen states in particular will see expenses of $10 billion or greater.73 Internationally, over one hundred countries will face at least $1 billion in costs.74 In the United States, the construction of more than 50,000 miles of coastal barriers, a popular adaptation structure, in twenty-two states will make the cost of just one important climate adaptation rival the price tag for the original interstate highway system.75 Looking specifically at coastal adaptation to account for sea-level rise as the emblematic example,76 the estimated costs are significant and widespread. More than fifty percent of the United States population resides in areas that will need to invest to adapt to rising seas.77 Adaptation strategies for municipal- ities facing the threat of sea-level rise have been consistently classified by the 69.

Indeed, the growing expense of flood insurance in the United States in the face of climate change has been the subject of much scholarly attention.85 By some estimates, thanks in large part to climate risk, the exposure of the United States government as an insurer could be as much as seven trillion dollars over the next seventy-five years.86 “Protection” involves the construction of infrastructure—such as seawalls, levees, dikes, and sand dunes—to protect existing residential and commercial structures in at-risk areas.87 This is the most frequently discussed adaptation strategy across all climate effects. It is relatively straightforward and is a tech- nique that society has employed for centuries (e.g., the Netherlands).88 This history, coupled with the ability to document and project costs of protection infrastructure, makes seawalls and similar projects the most frequently included in adaptation cost estimates.89 As between these options, the price tag, and resultant policy strategy, will differ by geographic location. Political constraints may make the least-cost so- lution nonetheless untenable.

Those costs differ by community, which is one important reason why a liability scheme with room for individual damages calculations makes sense. One study of coastal communities estimated that seven cities in the United States would face seawall construction costs greater than one billion dollars.93 That same study included estimates for miles of seawall needed by state and the associated projected costs of construction.94 The National Oceanic and Atmos- pheric Administration (“NOAA”) has produced a framework for evaluating the economics of coastal adaptation infrastructure.95 In the decade since its publica- tion, the framework has begun to penetrate coastal community governments and thereby generated some detailed examples of how to price adaptation mea- sures in the real world.

Importantly, all of these causes of action sound in state law.110 The specific mix in the complaint of any individual public plaintiff depends almost entirely on the particularities of the jurisdiction’s caselaw.111 As the above discussion suggests, the climate impacts and necessary adaptation measures track similarly across the United States, with only the damages amounts differing. The three basic common law torts alleged in most cases are nuisance, tres- pass, and negligence. This is unsurprising. Nuisance and trespass form the ori- gins of environmental law, and negligence is in many ways the catch-all tort. Each theory has some challenges, and each embodies the “polluter pays” princi- ple. Nuisance comes in two varieties: public and private. Public nuisance arises when the defendants’ activity causes “an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.”112 Because these cases concern adaptation costs for public infrastructure (i.e., interference with common property), public nui- 106.

In order to prove public nuisance, the plaintiff governments will have to demonstrate how the marketing of fossil fuels and withholding of vital information led to the climate crisis we now find ourselves in, unreasonably imposing costs on coastal communities.113 The other tort forefather of modern environmental law—trespass—differs from nuisance in that it requires a physi- cal intrusion on property. Specifically, trespass occurs when an actor causes a physical boundary crossing onto the property of another without consent.114 If the intrusion causes actual harm, then the actor causing it need only have acted negligently or recklessly to be liable.115 Here, the physical intrusions are the effects of climate change, most notably the rising seas. In order to prove tres- pass, the plaintiff governments will thus have to demonstrate that the defend- ants produced and marketed fossil fuels with the knowledge that their activities were likely to cause sea levels to intrude upon public property.116 Finally, ordi- nary negligence imposes liability on actors whose unreasonable conduct causes injury to those to whom they owe a duty.117 The focus for the negligence in- quiry as it pertains to fossil fuel defendants will be the causal chain. All of these traditional common law torts theoretically fit, but each also present significant challenges of proof, particularly on the issues of intent and causation. The second category of causes of action included in litigation seeking to impose liability for climate adaptation grew out of traditional torts and contract 113.

A product that is defective in design is one that, when manufactured to specifica- tions, poses an unreasonable risk to an ordinary user.120 Manufacturers are also required by law to provide warnings on products when they knew or should have known that the normal use could cause harm.121 The fossil fuel industry put its products into the stream of commerce with full knowledge of the likeli- hood of climate change and the attendant harms. Consequently, under this theory of liability, the fossil fuel industry was obligated to consider reasonable alternative designs and provide adequate warnings of the consequence of using their products. In order to prove design defect, the plaintiff governments will thus have to demonstrate that the defendants failed to consider reasonable al- ternative designs to their products that would not have contributed as signifi- cantly to climate change.122 That could be a challenging but not insurmountable 118.

The same statutes provided the basis for some of the most successful tobacco litigation in the 1990s,126 as well as the recent wave of opioid litigation.127 Mas- sachusetts has a representatively potent version of such statutes128 and a piece of climate litigation relying on it.129 The Massachusetts statute declares unlawful “[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the 123.

Due to the similar defendants across jurisdictions and the significant relief sought, even one success for the plaintiffs would have global implications. Add to that the unpredictability of jury awards, and the universal appeal of a federal statutory solution becomes clearer. The twenty-eight currently pending cases present some unique challenges and technically carry independent probabilities of success. At the same time, they share one major obstacle, and their fates are intertwined. The cases that have proceeded the furthest to this point span the United States—from Hawai’i to Oakland, California to Massachusetts (and a few in between). The first hur- dle any climate adaptation tort case inevitably confronts is avoiding removal from state to federal court.139 Because of the holdings in AEP140and Kivalina,141 if a climate tort case is sent to federal court, it is more likely it will be dismissed for failure to state a cognizable claim.142 Those cases involved the doctrine of displacement, which explicitly concerns whether a federal statute, here the Clean Air Act, replaces federal common law. Their resolution left open the possibility that the related, but substantially different, doctrine of preemption would not apply to foreclose state law tort claims.143 However, fossil fuel defendants argue that because of the federal interests involved in tort claims premised on global cuit split that we took this case to resolve and we believe the wiser course is to leave these matters for the Fourth Circuit to resolve in the first instance . . . . The judgment of the Fourth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.”). 139. Removal is the process by which a defendant can move a case pending before a state court to the federal district court in the same jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. §1446 (outlining the general steps for removal based on subject matter jurisdiction). So-called “federal officer removal” pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1442 permits the removal of claims against federal officers and agencies, including some entities that contract with the United States government. 140.

The question decided was whether, on an appeal of a district court’s remand order, a court may consider all of the potential grounds for removal. The scope of such an appeal was unsettled be- cause most remand orders are not appealable at all.152 By statute, remand deci- sions based on so-called “federal officer removal”153 were made subject to immediate appeal.154 The fossil fuel defendants in climate adaptation cases, in- cluding BP, raise federal officer removal as one of many purported grounds for federal jurisdiction. Thus, the district court’s remand order in Baltimore v. BP was subject to appeal in the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit limited its consideration to the federal officer removal grounds, deciding that other grounds for removal were not properly subject to appeal.155 The Supreme Court decided otherwise, holding that once properly on appeal thanks to the federal officer removal issue, any other issues in a remand order could also be consid- ered.156 Procedurally, the Supreme Court’s decision means that every remand order issued by a federal district court will be fully relitigated on appeal in the corresponding circuit court. Importantly, however, the Supreme Court said nothing about how the underlying issues should be resolved.

Only in Hawai’i168 and Massachusetts169 have judges begun to grapple with more substantive grounds for dismissal advanced by the defendants’ pre-trial motions. The road from such motions to discovery and ultimately trial lies uncharted but will no doubt prove long, arduous, and expensive. From the plaintiffs’, and civil society’s, perspective, a federal statutory cause of action would provide similar advantages, vis-a`-vis the torts system, as CERCLA did in 1980. Like CERCLA before it, CARLA would impose at least some form of strict liability and dictate how to divide (or not) that liability amongst responsible parties. It would also likely impose that liability retroac- tively against fossil fuel corporations who may no longer be producing or mar- keting. CERCLA provided some much-needed clarity on these questions in an area where the real-world problems pervaded,170 but the existing theories of liability were largely untested.171 By the early 1980s, there was no question that contaminated toxic sites dotted the landscape, imposing real risks on communi- ties ill-equipped to protect citizens against them. The only question was who would pay to clean those sites up. Congress made the answer to that question more straightforward all across the United States by passing CERCLA. Since its inception, CERCLA has led to the identification and initiation of cleanup activities at almost 2,000 national priority list sites.172 Now, in the 2020s, there is similarly little question that climate change imposes real risks on communities similarly ill-equipped to protect against them.173 Americans again find themselves asking who will pay for the necessary protections. Congress has the opportunity to respond as it did four decades ago and create a comprehensive statutory liability scheme to answer that important question. The alternative is waiting years for piecemeal litigation to work its way through state court systems around the country, potentially reaching dispa- rate results, while communities take on debt to finance necessary adaptation infrastructure (or worse, decline to build it at all) without any assurance that funds will be recovered from any of the corporations responsible for the climate crisis. 168.

Causation and Adaptation Damages Calculations Accountability174 and attribution175 science have made the causation ele- ment of the above-described tort causes of action, and the damages portion of CARLA liability, possible to prove. Accountability work seeks to trace histori- cal greenhouse gas emissions to specific industries and companies, ultimately providing a quantitative assessment of relative culpability for the current state of the crisis. Attribution work seeks to causally connect specific impacts and events to anthropogenic climate change.176 These two pieces of the puzzle are essential to proving causation in any climate adaptation tort case. Plaintiffs will have to convincingly establish that (1) defendant fossil fuel corporations caused climate change (i.e., accountability) and (2) climate change concretely injured plaintiff communities (i.e., attribution). On the first question, a number of recent studies could help. In 2014, Richard Heede published a groundbreaking study tracing two-thirds of cumu- lative greenhouse gas emissions from the Industrial Revolution forward to the largest ninety fossil fuel and cement producers.177 The study also found that of those two-thirds of cumulative emissions, about half came after 1986.178 Ac- companying that study, Dr. Heede published the Carbon Majors Database,179 which gave birth to subsequent Carbon Majors Reports.180 The 2017 Carbon Majors Report updated the findings, tracing over half of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 to just twenty-five producers181 and over 174.

One such study from 2017 found that emissions from the ninety carbon majors accounted for between 42–50% of the rise in global mean surface temperature and 26–32% of the rise in global sea level since 1880.183 The study further found that from 1980 onward, those producers accounted for 29–35% of the rise in temperature, and 11–14% of the rise in sea level.184 Those are remarkably precise levels of fault, even for an ordinary torts case. How to inform a jury tasked with appor- tioning responsibility between multiple defendants has long been a subject of debate,185 with less precise calculations routinely admitted as evidence. None- theless, accountability science is still a niche and nascent field, and no court has yet had the opportunity to consider the specific studies mentioned here. After establishing that fossil fuel defendants bear a cognizable level of cul- pability for climate change itself, plaintiffs have to complete the causal chain by linking their specific injuries to climate change (rather than some other cause unrelated to defendants’ conduct). Causation is a tricky thing, and torts scholars love to debate its boundaries.186 Toxic torts cases infamously pose thorny problems of proof on the matter.187 Climate change torts, even those narrowly focused on adaptation, face a similar challenge. As Michael Burger, Jessica Wentz, and Radley Horton aptly describe it: “[t]he most fundamental challenge is that, as research moves further down the causal chain from human influence on climate change to discrete impacts on human and natural systems, research- ers must account for an increasing number of non-climate and exogenous vari- ables.”188 Even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) has acknowledged the difficulty in separating the impacts of anthropogenic climate 182.

Notwithstanding that difficulty of proof in a courtroom, science has con- tinued to advance. Recent studies demonstrate, with increasing confidence, that climate change causes injury to coastal communities,191 and then those studies attempt to quantify the injury.192 Those injuries lead to health, social, and eco- nomic damages, including the infrastructure and property changes discussed above, decreases in productivity, and scarcity of food.193 Tabulating the damages will involve large-scale accounting, but not necessarily advanced scientific mod- eling. The science comes in when lawyers need to connect the damages to the root cause. On that front, the most recent IPCC report made major strides in attributing specific extreme weather events to climate change.194 Annual reports from the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society include the most recent studies attempting to connect specific negative effects and events (e.g., flooding, drought, extreme precipitation) to anthropogenic climate change.195 One included study, for example, found that the probability of a roughly half meter flood in Miami had increased by more than 500% since 1994 due to 189.

This nascent science remains relatively untested before a judge or jury.201 A statutory scheme would alleviate the need to rely on this evidence for causation.

They might well prefer, from a business and public relations standpoint, to deal with a known liability risk through a streamlined federal statutory remedy than a plethora of unknown disparate lia- bility risks across many jurisdictions. III. THE POLITICAL AND POLICY CASE FOR A STATUTORY REMEDY Parallels between the present and the early 1980s exist with respect to the torts’ uncertainty and the thorniness of responding to widespread environmen- tal impacts. Those parallels counsel for another legislative response. A legisla- tive response requires the legislature, a group of elected politicians, which makes a comparative assessment of the political climates essential to completing the case for CARLA. Unfortunately, it is indisputable that Congress is more polarized now than it was in 1980.205 That is not a good sign for CARLA. Recall that CERCLA became law during a lame duck session of Congress.206 As the above story re- calls, the road from President Carter’s pledge after the Love Canal disaster to CERCLA’s passage was not an easy one.207 Thus, even in a more moderate time, when environmentalism was less often a partisan issue,208 a liability-based solution to clean up the country needed some help to get across the finish line. There is consequently plenty of reason to believe that in today’s politics a new liability scheme to address even the tangible effects (not the causes) of climate 202. See infra Part IV. 203.

Some recent signs specific to this en- deavor do nonetheless provide a glimmer of optimism, which is worth illumi- nating here. Both Democrats and Republicans have proposed legislation in response, at least in part, to the growing body of adaptation torts cases in the states. The Republican-led effort unsurprisingly sought to immunize fossil fuel corpora- tions from liability. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, some republican lawmakers proposed an amendment to the relief bill that would have given the “energy” sector liability protections as one of the nation’s “lifeline functions.”209 The provision did not gain traction and never made it into law, though similar provisions continue to be the subject of study and debate.210 On the other side of the aisle, a group of democratic lawmakers have pushed the Polluters Pay Climate Fund Act of 2021.211 That legislation would impose a fee on any fossil fuel corporation responsible for at least 0.05% of the total carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions over the last twenty years and use the proceeds to create an adaptation fund, capped at $500 billion over ten years.212 This proposal is a retroactive carbon tax by another name, rather than a true liability scheme. In- deed, the bill specifically preserves the option to concurrently pursue state court tort liability.213 Unsurprisingly, the Polluters Pay Climate Fund Act has gar- nered no Republican support.214 In between these extremes, a compromise could emerge: a CARLA that does not foreclose liability altogether but defini- tively sets its terms, preempting the mess of ongoing tort litigation. The liabil- ity waiver for state law torts would appeal to Republicans and corporate interests, while the ability to make polluters pay even some of the tab for adap- 209.

Such a compromise might still prove untenable (to either or both sides), but it is likely the only way a version of CARLA passes at the federal level.215 Prior to CERCLA’s passage, there is some evidence that state legislative action and judicial rulings favorable to the environment had left industry unset- tled and fearful of liability. Those conditions may have contributed to a less robust lobbying assault against CERCLA than one might expect, and perhaps even led some to push for federal legislation.216 The situation was not dissimilar to the one facing the auto manufacturing industry prior to the passage of the Clean Air Act—a myriad of state law requirements and court rulings engender- ing uncertainty and creating inefficiencies in production.217 The threat of multi- billion-dollar damages awards in multiple states could very well motivate the fossil fuel industry to accept a federal statutory solution. That motivation would shift from a nudge to a shove if even one of the cases mentioned above results in an actual judgment against fossil fuel defendants. As some of those cases move closer to that possibility,218 the pressure builds. Torts scholarship has long recognized a number of supporting rationales for imposing liability, including the two most salient to this endeavor—the in- strumentalist219 and corrective justice theories.220 215. The political viability of individual state statutes that impose liability on fossil fuel producers is a wholly different matter, at least in a subset of states where more progressive politicians possess legislative majorities. In the CERCLA context, state legislation abounds (though that effort followed the federal statute); 47 states have their own CERCLA-type statutes. See U.S. GOV’T ACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-13-633T, HAZARDOUS WASTE CLEANUP: OBSERVATIONS ON STATES’ ROLE, LIABILITIES AT DOD AND HARDROCK MINING SITES, AND LITIGATION ISSUES (2013).

Thus, under this the- ory, imposing liability on oil, coal, and gas companies to cover the costs of adaptation would make continued production of fossil fuels more expensive (perhaps prohibitively so) and consequently less prevalent (and eventually non- existent). The market, with the liability signals in place, would shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Adaptation liability then serves the instru- mental purpose of encouraging mitigation (through fuel shifting).223 Put an- other way, one might view the liability scheme discussed herein as a backdoor climate mitigation effort, a way to act on climate when direct regulation of emissions seems less and less likely at the federal level. Corrective justice theorists, on the other hand, build upon the retributive justice perspective imported from criminal law to explain why tort liability fo- cuses on rights and wrongs. In other words, liability exists to punish wrongdo- ers and redistribute ill-gotten gains to their victims.224 The ultimate goal of any liability scheme for these thinkers is fairness. The rationale applies rather straightforwardly to climate adaptation liability for fossil fuel producers, follow- ing the centuries-old environmental law trope of “polluter pays.”225 As detailed in the sections that follow, the costs of climate adaptation are already signifi- cant, and still growing. The silver lining, from a liability perspective, is that one can trace the primary cause of our climate crisis to the action (and inaction) of a single industry—fossil fuel. Corporations who make their business extracting these fuels from the earth and selling them to citizens and governments have, it turns out, known for decades that the emissions from their products would cause widespread and irreversible damages.226 To date, they have employed venge, 40 SAN DIEGO L.

Corrective justice theory posits that the imposi- tion of liability would fairly redistribute and repurpose fossil fuel profits to help repair the situation the industry’s wrongdoing created. From a climate policy perspective, imposing statutory liability on upstream producers to compensate communities for the costs of adaptation makes sense when compared to other options. As the pending cases demonstrate, state court trials do not always proceed with all deliberate speed, especially not when well- resourced defendants throw up every conceivable roadblock. A federal statutory liability scheme would streamline the process, facilitating the distribution of funds to communities who are in desperate need of them due to already salient climate effects. Further, choosing fossil fuel producers, rather than individual users, as the polluters who will pay makes practical and moral sense.227 On the practical side, it is much easier to identify and litigate or negotiate with a small group (one hundred or fewer) of corporate potentially responsible parties than an extremely large group of disparate consumers of fossil fuels (millions).228 And, inevitably, consumers will not be totally off the hook, as producers will certainly pass on some of the costs of liability.229 From a moral and tort theory perspective, fossil fuel producers are wrongdoers. They are not the only wrong- doers in the climate crisis; but they are the wrongdoers who acted with prior knowledge230 and who have the most ability to pay.231 IV. FEATURES OF STATUTORY LIABILITY CERCLA’s power has derived in large part from three distinct features of the liability it imposes. That liability is (1) strict, (2) joint and several, and (3) retroactive. CERCLA’s text was neither precise nor explicit as to the applica- tion of these principles and their scope, however.232 In the years following CERCLA’s enactment, these defining fundamental features took shape via ju- dicial interpretation of the statutory text.233 Much of the development of the 227.

ATKESON, SUPERFUND: LITIGATION AND CLEANUP, BNA (1985) (presenting a comprehensive overview of the emerging body of law under CERCLA, a brief description of CERCLA’s major provisions and legislative history, an issue-by-issue discussion of CERCLA case law, and a table of cited cases).\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\H\\HLE\\47-2\\HLE204.txt unknown Seq: 38 19-JUL-23 11:46 510 HarvardEnvironmentalLawReview [Vol. 47 workings of superfund liability came in the early years after the statute’s enact- ment.234 That flurry of activity provided early evidence of two things. First, Congress had succeeded in provoking a renewed effort to clean up contami- nated sites and recover costs for such. Second, Congress had failed to spell out the terms of liability with sufficient legal precision. Courts managed to preserve CERCLA’s power by interpreting the act in accordance with Congress’s pro- fessed intention that it provide a comprehensive response to the problem of sites contaminated by hazardous substances.235 Any comprehensive liability scheme for climate adaptation would be wise to track the defining features of CERCLA liability and do so even more explicitly than CERCLA initially did. As with the difficulty of using common law tort to make polluters pay to clean up contaminated sites in the 1980s, there are several challenges—many similar, some different—in applying common law tort liability to GHG emis- sions. In both situations, proving causation of any one of multiple defendants could be costly, risky, and scientifically daunting. GHG emitters, like the haz- ardous waste dumpers before them, will likely claim a de minimis individual contribution. The sheer number of emitters that exist as well as attributional challenges related to damage from climate change are other common problems to finding polluters liable. This causes problems in the establishment of duty. Thus, a strict, joint and several, and retroactive liability bill for GHG emissions could help overcome challenges to traditional common law causes of action as CERCLA did. It is useful to examine closely each of these features—how they originated in CERCLA text and caselaw and how they would apply to climate adaptation liability. A. Strict Liability Strict liability, or liability without fault, dispenses with the plaintiff’s obli- gation to prove intent, knowledge, or even negligence on the part of the defen- dant with respect to the activity or consequences in question.236 It is generally enough to prove simply that the defendant’s product (or activity) was unreason- ably dangerous.237 This makes it a powerful tool, applied sparingly under the common law to cases of product liability (i.e., defective products)238 and “abnor- 234.

By definition, CERCLA sites involve contamination from the use or disposal of hazardous or dangerous substances,240 which could very well be considered “ab- normally dangerous activity.”241 Perhaps it was the theoretical connection to other sources of strict liability that led congress to draft CERCLA’s liability provisions narrowly. Section 107 of CERCLA specifically delineates the parties potentially liable for cleanup242 and the limited defenses available to them.243 The four specific categories of potentially responsible parties are: (1) the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility, (2) any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of, (3) any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility or incinera- tion vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and contain- ing such hazardous substances, and (4) any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities, incineration vessels or sites selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a gaged in the business of selling such a product, and (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.”). 239.

In 1984, the Central District of California held that the legislative history “[m]ake[s] it clear that traditional tort notions, such as proximate cause, do not apply.”247 Other federal district courts held similarly, often in even more definitive language.248 The Second Circuit considered the issue on appeal and held that a CERCLA plaintiff is not required to prove that the acts of a defendant directly caused or contributed to the circumstance which required response action.249 All of these decisions came shortly after CERCLA went into effect. By the end of the decade, the matter was effectively settled. CERCLA liability was strict.250 The Supreme Court seemed to agree by 1989 when it heard the case of Pennsylvania v.

Without it, players in industries that depend on hazardous substances would be able to disclaim liability by simply pointing fingers at each other. With strict liability, any industry participant is incentivized to not only avoid contaminating sites but to raise industry stan- dards so others do not do so either. The type of strict liability that courts have applied in CERCLA cases would work well for climate adaptation costs. Similarly, an industry has im- posed the most significant environmental externality of their operations on so- ciety. As discussed above,256 the largest fossil fuel companies have controlled the production and distribution of the primary driver of climate change. Their con- trol over fossil fuel is like the potentially responsible parties’ control over haz- ardous substances. In both instances, the imposition of liability without fault is key to forcing the industry as a whole to internalize the externality (i.e., to make the polluter pay). One can make a strong theoretical case for the common law strict liability in the case of fossil fuels. After all, the production and distribution (i.e., sale) of fossil fuels presents a fairly straightforward products liability situation. Indeed, the currently pending state tort cases all include claims of product defects.257 A statutory strict liability scheme would simply confirm that the law of products 251.

As with CERCLA, when fault drops out of CARLA’s liability equation, something else needs to define the bounds of the scheme’s reach. The four defined categories of CERCLA liability put an emphasis on control over haz- ardous substances and/or property that ultimately led to contamination.259 In this way the statute reached back to the root of pollution problem, rather than targeting individual bad actors. A parallel scheme for climate adaptation liabil- ity would emphasize the introduction and control of the underlying substance (i.e., fossil fuels) that generates greenhouse gas pollution. A directly parallel scheme would hold liable the following260: (1) the producer or distributor of a fossil fuel, (2) any person who at the time of distribution of any fossil fuel owned or operated any facility at which such fossil fuels were produced or distributed, (3) any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for production or distribution of fossil fuels, or arranged with a trans- porter for transport of fossil fuels, owned or possessed by such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility owned or operated by another party or entity and producing such fossil fuels, (4) any person who accepts or accepted any fossil fuels for transport to distribution facilities. The difficulty with such a rigid scheme is that it has the potential to cap- ture an unwieldy number of very small operators. In particular, the proposed sections (2)–(4) would impose liability on businesses of any size involved with the transportation and sale of gasoline, a category that includes a great number of sole proprietorships and family-owned businesses. Even larger fossil fuel en- tities would argue that, counted alone, each’s contribution is de minimis.261 In contrast to the defined geographic universe of a CERCLA site, any adaptation project theoretically implicates most, if not all, of the global universe of poten- tially responsible parties. Hence, a statutory climate liability scheme will need to use something more than geographic boundaries to identify the potentially re- 258. See supra Part II.B. 259. See 42 U.S.C. §9607(a). 260.

As mentioned above, one similar piece of already proposed legislation would impose a tax on any company responsible for at least 0.05% of the total carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions over the last twenty years.263 A liability threshold of that kind would track the carbon majors list fairly well, which would make scientific and policy sense. It would also be consistent with the approach to liability in the tobacco and opioid set- tlements.264 The ability to include such a threshold in a statutory liability scheme presents a significant advantage over the current state-based tort ap- proach. If no statutory liability scheme emerges for climate adaptation, state courts will likely resort to imprecise and inconsistent interpretations of what constitutes de minimis contribution absolving a defendant of liability. The second, less common category of common law strict liability concerns abnormally dangerous activity. The movement, use, or control of hazardous substances could very well be “abnormally dangerous.” But even there, tort law was reluctant to interpret that category so broadly.265 Fossil fuel production and distribution appear more innocuous on their own than use of hazardous sub- stances; many ordinary citizens transport propane or kerosene tanks in passen- ger vehicles, for instance. However, the documentation of the increasingly dangerous effects of climate change, along with the ability to more directly attribute those effects to fossil fuel activity, suggests something abnormal is afoot. There also exists precedent in the Clean Air Act for determining hazard based on chemical concentration over time, which is precisely the type of prob- lem the accumulation of greenhouse gases presents.266 Greenhouse gas accumu- lation is definitely not as clearly abnormally dangerous as some of the emblematic contamination cases like Love Canal where humans were suffering acute and significant harm resulting from exposure to certain chemicals. It is not dangerous per se to come into contact with carbon dioxide, but at scale the abnormal danger becomes apparent. In some ways, we are talking about hazards resulting from human and industrial activity. Industrial activity is often human 262. At a minimum, the fossil fuel producing entities within the state where an accountability action originates should probably have some liability. However, confining it to just those entities ignores the realities of atmospheric science and greenhouse gas emissions. 263. See infra Part II.B. 264.

Thus, we may be able to draw a line between inherently dan- gerous fossil fuel production and the type of production that does not rise to that level. Again, this type of line drawing would be important for a strict cli- mate liability scheme to function properly. B. Joint and Several Liability At common law, “joint and several liability” makes each of multiple de- fendants liable for the entirety of the plaintiff’s loss, regardless of relative culpa- bility or degrees of fault. Put another way, in the words of the Restatement, a plaintiff can “sue for and recover the full amount of recoverable damages from any [defendant].”267 This principle prioritizes the plaintiff being made whole over any one defendant potentially overpaying relative to the harm they caused. The alternatives (i.e., liability apportioned based on fault, ability to pay, or some other metric) increase the possibility that a successful plaintiff will still be less than whole in the event of an insolvent or recalcitrant defendant. Joint and several liability also puts the burden on the wrongdoers to apportion damages amongst themselves through contribution actions, rather than forcing the inno- cent plaintiff to prove separate damages amounts for each defendant. Once wrongdoing has been established, when faced with a choice between tortfeasor and victim, the morally justified option places the burden on the tortfeasor. At common law, joint and several liability attaches when two or more tortfeasors either act in concert or act independently but create an indivisible harm.268 The first category captures actors who coordinated to harm the plain- tiff and rightly holds them each fully responsible for the coordinated action. The second category addresses the concerns articulated above with respect to ensuring that a plaintiff is made whole. A relevant, albeit rare, variation on ordinary joint and several liability is what has been called “market share” liabil- ity. This rule may apply when a generic product causes an injury and there are multiple manufacturers of identical versions of that product.269 In such circum- stances, after the famous Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories270 case, a court may hold defendant manufacturers proportionately liable in accordance with their market share in the market of the good. 267.

Thus, most courts applied ordinary tort principles and held multiple defendants jointly and severally liable for indivisible harm.272 Contemporary scholars generally agreed.273 By the end of the first decade of CERCLA litigation, the Fourth Circuit aptly described the statute as permissive of joint and several liability for indivisible harm in 1988.274 In practice, joint and several liability became the default under CER- CLA.275 The statute included no requirement that all potentially responsible parties be included in an initial action pursuant to Section 107. And, further- more, if there was any doubt on the matter, Congress amended the statute to specifically contemplate that parties would seek contribution from one another, making such a cause of action explicit in Section 113.276 A contribution claim embodies a “tortfeasor’s right to collect from others responsible for the same tort after the tortfeasor has paid more than his or her proportionate share, the shares being determined as a percentage of fault.”277 As Justice Thomas ex- plained in Atlantic Research, this traditional tort understanding of contribution applies to CERCLA liability through §113(f).278 Such a cause of action is only necessary because Section 107 imposes joint and several liability in most instances.279 In response to joint and several liability emerging as the default in CER- CLA cases, potentially responsible parties turned to a “divisibility of harm” de- fense.

United States, “CERCLA defendants seeking to avoid joint and several liability bear the burden of proving that a reasonable basis for apportionment exists.”284 The Court went on to articulate two points on which proof must be sufficient: (1) that the harm to the environment is capable of division and (2) that a reasonable basis to apportion damages exists.285 In Bur- lington Northern, no dispute existed as to the first element, and so the Supreme Court only had occasion to comment on what constitutes a “reasonable basis” for the division of liability.286 The Court upheld a division based on the specific chemicals handled by the defendant, the percentage of surface area where de- 280.

With the benefit of CERCLA and common law developments, the drafters of CARLA can make explicit the ap- plication of joint and several liability to fossil fuel producers and the burden on them should they seek apportionment. The statute would then go on to specifi- cally articulate the factors and burden of proof. Assuming the universe of potentially responsible parties is limited accord- ing to one (or more) of the thresholds described in the prior section, the jointly and severally liable fossil fuel defendants would each have significant assets to contribute. There is no doubt they would try to argue divisibility. However, if the two-part Burlington Northern test applied, defendants would have a prob- lem on the first element. From one perspective, climate change is the ultimate indivisible environmental harm—greenhouse gases from diffuse sources aggre- gate and comingle to create a layer of pollution that is rapidly warming the earth.289 Looking instead at the harmful effects of climate change, though, could provide some basis for divisibility—adaptation costs differ depending upon whether the target is sea level rise or changes in precipitation or extreme weather events or any of the other well-documented climate effects. Under- standably, it is nonetheless impossible for attribution science to tie any of these specific effects to a specific fossil fuel producer. Climate effects are not chemical contamination. Fossil fuel entities’ contributions to climate change thus resem- ble CERCLA potentially responsible parties who all dumped the same chemi- cal on the same site at different times. As a policy matter, Congress could decide that the first Burlington North- ern factor is not necessary in the climate adaptation context and draft CARLA to reflect that departure from CERCLA precedent. In that situation, fossil fuel defendants would only have the burden of establishing a reasonable basis on which to apportion liability. As described above, the Carbon Majors Report potentially provides that basis.290 At least some members of Congress agree that dividing responsibility for adaptation costs proportional to contributions to fos- 287.

At least one scholar modeled how this might work in the related context of nuisance suits against greenhouse gas emitters.292 Hence, apportionment in the climate adap- tation context would much more closely resemble market share liability than divisibility under CERCLA.293 The justifications for recognizing market share liability do fit adaptation liability quite well. According to the Restatement, the appropriateness of mar- ket share liability depends on six factors: (1) The generic nature of the product; (2) the long latency period of the harm; (3) the inability of plaintiffs to discover which defendant’s product caused plaintiff’s harm; (4) the clarity of the causal connec- tion between the defective product and the harm suffered by plain- tiffs; (5) the absence of other medical or environmental factors that could have caused or materially contributed to the harm; and (6) the availability of sufficient “market share” data to support a reasonable apportionment of liability.294 Branded fossil fuels, especially after they are combusted and become carbon emissions, are indistinguishable from one another.295 A plaintiff would have difficulty proving which specific atmospheric emissions came from which com- pany, and similar difficulty proving which emissions represent the climate tip- ping point leading to more harmful effects. As one scholar put it, “a carbon is a carbon is a carbon”—where it comes from “makes no difference in terms of its impact.”296 Precedent exists for this approach; one of the only contexts where market share liability has been recognized outside of generic pharmaceuticals is environmental harm.297 Specifically, New Hampshire courts applied market 291.

Climate adaptation damages would serve the same function for a more widespread set of costs. A default of joint and several liability in CARLA would put the burden of justifying apportionment or seeking contribution on the fossil fuel producers held liable by the strict liability provision outlined above. That approach would create considerable transaction costs, but at least the majority of those costs would be borne only by liable parties (and not the plaintiffs). That approach would also do the most to ensure that state and local governments actually receive adequate compensation. An alternative approach would codify the ap- plication of market share liability principles to climate adaptation liability. That approach has sound basis in theory and recent precedent. Either way, CARLA must clearly articulate the scope of relative liability. It is not enough to do as CERCLA did and rely on traditional tort principles. C. Retroactive Liability A “retroactive law” is a law “that looks backward or contemplates the past, affecting acts or facts that existed before the act came into effect.”300 Retroactiv- ity is perhaps the most important feature of CERCLA liability. After all, the statute aimed to clean up sites that had already been contaminated. It would have been severely compromised on that dimension if it imposed liability only on the entities that owned or operated sites at the time of passage. Instead, CERCLA liability attaches to any party that fits into one of Section 107’s four categories at any point in time. Retroactive liability is a rare and powerful tool that departs from the common law norm.301 Negligence ordinarily judges the 298. See State v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 126 A.3d 266, 275 (2015) (affirming a jury finding “that Exxon’s market share for gasoline in New Hampshire during the applicable time period was 28.94%”). 299. Id.

Conse- quently, the source of CERCLA liability’s retroactive application must be the statute itself, not some underlying tort principle. Like strict and joint and several liability, however, the statute’s text did not speak explicitly on retroactivity. Some commentators initially pointed this out in forcefully arguing against its retroactive application.302 The relevant portion of Section 107 uses past tense verbs to describe at least some of the potentially responsible parties.303 Most significant of those provisions, Section 107(a)(2) imposes liability on “any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.”304 That provision makes the time of disposal, rather than the time of the statute’s enactment, the legally relevant point from which liability derives. Courts interpreting the statute relied on this language and the legislative history to conclude that CERCLA holds responsible parties liable for acts com- mitted before the passage of the statute.305 In particular, federal district courts in New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Colorado noted that CERCLA’s legislative history made clear that Congress intended it to be “backward looking.”306 By the mid 1980s, CERCLA’s retroactive application was seemingly settled law. Nonetheless, as the Supreme Court has considered the retroactive application of other statutes, some commentators have called for a reexamination of CERCLA.307 While a few lower courts have taken up that project,308 neither the Supreme Court nor Congress have waded in to change 302.

The prevailing interpretation remains that CERCLA imposes retroactive liability. Much like contaminated sites in 1980, the atmosphere is already polluted by greenhouse gases. While something might be done to mitigate its degree, climate change is a reality thanks to historical emissions. Those emissions can largely be traced to the fossil fuel industry and further isolated within that in- dustry to a subset of the worst contributors. Certainly, CERCLA-style retro- activity makes a great deal of sense, especially as newer and possibly disrupting geopolitical events and new industry may cause previous emitters to leave the market. All of these factors make retroactivity a necessary feature of any effec- tive climate adaptation liability scheme. However, in the case of greenhouse gas pollution, the relevant timescale is not as straightforward as industrial contamination. Most greenhouse gases are “stock” pollutants, capable of persisting in the atmosphere and warming the planet for decades, even centuries.309 In contrast, the contaminated sites CER- CLA sought to address dated at most back to the industrial revolution in the early twentieth century. Thus, the question in crafting CARLA is how far back to look when determining who is liable and, if apportionment applies, in what amount. The question is one of policy and one of scientific capability. With respect to policy, an appropriate cutoff would be the time that the fossil fuel industry possessed information indicating that climate change would result from their continued operation. Investigative journalism has uncovered reports to the American Petroleum Institute dating back to 1968 that warn of the dan- gers of carbon dioxide pollution and resultant global warming.310 Retroactivity at least to that date consequently comes with some supporting moral justifica- tion. With respect to science, Richard Heede’s seminal accountability work tracked contributions to climate change from fossil fuel producers all the way back to the 1850s.311 Much of the subsequent work has focused on a narrower window of time between the 1980s and today.312 Nonetheless, the existing body of scientific work indicates that lack of data will not constrain the reach of retroactive liability for climate adaptation. Instead, the policy question should determine the scope of CARLA’s retroactive application. There is no question that retroactivity is essential to any functioning cli- mate adaptation liability scheme. Adaptation is necessary at this point due to actions that will necessarily predate the passage of CARLA. Recent, post- CERCLA Supreme Court precedent indicates that the Court will generally 309.

This will undoubtedly come at a political cost, but it sets the necessary terms of debate given the current concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the inevitability of at least some warm- ing and associated adaptation costs. How far back in time the statutory liability reaches (rather than retroactivity at all) could be the appropriate subject of the almost certain political debate. CONCLUSION Climate policy in the United States faces a new reality. On the mitigation side, the ball has been passed to the state and local governments. If two decades of Congressional inaction were not enough evidence of this, the United States Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. EPA315 made it clear. Federal ac- tion, if it comes at all, will be too little, too late. With that realization comes increased importance of the other half of the climate policy equation—adapta- tion. Currently, the financial burden of climate adaptation sits with those same state and local governments. Many of them have wisely turned to the torts system to shift at least some costs to the corporations responsible for pushing fossil fuels with no regard for the environmental consequences. Some of their cases may succeed, and others may fail. That may be the end of the story. But as they sit pending, the federal government has the opportunity to take a lesson from history, step in, and fashion an efficient system of climate adaptation liability. A Climate Adaptation Resilience and Liability Act, or CARLA, would promote efficiency, appropriately redistribute the economic burdens of climate change, and, most importantly, help protect some of our most vulnerable citi- zens. Thankfully, as argued above, there exist some strong practical and politi- cal arguments to compel at least the drafting and introduction of legislation in Congress. Nonetheless, should those incentives prove less than motivating, I offer one final suggestion as to how interested citizens might increase pressure on the federal government. State legislatures can pass their own mini- 313. See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 245 (1994) (“The presumption against statutory retroactivity is founded upon elementary considerations of fairness dictating that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their con- duct accordingly.”). 314.

No current federal law preempts them. States have for centuries modified the common law of torts within their borders by statute. A mini- CARLA would decidedly do nothing more than that, at least legally.

It is hard to im- agine such a statutory liability scheme making its way through Congress, irre- spective of the underlying problem it sought to address. A snapshot of the historical, legal, and political context of CERCLA’s passage in 1980 has the potential to guide future efforts at national policymaking through the imposi- tion of corporate liability. Now, the world confronts another watershed moment in environmental history, and past actors face a potential flood of liability. Tort cases in jurisdic- tions across the nation assert that the fossil fuel industry must compensate the public entities already footing the bill for climate adaptation.2 The potential for disparate results in these cases over the next decade threatens to undermine the necessary infrastructure improvements they seek to facilitate. As with the toxic contamination plaguing the country at mid-century, citizens have taken notice of the harms at their doorsteps and underequipped local governments have been forced to lead the response.3 Back then, the accumulated harm bubbled up in punctuated disasters, and the federal government responded by enacting CER- CLA in 1980 to bring some order to what had been disjointed, ineffective efforts to clean up contamination across the country. The federal government can wait for some climate-induced disaster to prompt similar action, or, draw- ing on lessons from CERCLA, act swiftly to draft and pass what this work calls a “Climate Adaptation Resilience and Liability Act” or “CARLA.” Much of the situation is different in 2023 from that in 1980. However, some important legal, political, and practical elements today mirror those that paved the way for CERCLA’s passage. A statutory scheme for climate liability thus could serve as an important feature of climate adaptation policy as we move further into a century punctuated by the harsh realities of a changed cli- mate. The focus on adaptation strategies (e.g., infrastructure improvements and land use changes in coastal communities)4 rather than punitive damages (i.e., penalties) makes the CARLA-CERCLA parallel apt. As with cleanup costs, adaptation costs are necessary to protect human and environmental health; someone must bear them. CARLA, like CERCLA before it, would efficiently 2. See infra Part II. 3.

Both torts theory and climate policy support a statutory scheme that im- poses liability for climate adaptation costs on fossil fuel producers. For almost two decades, torts scholars have discussed the application of various theories of liability—nuisance, trespass, negligence, and more—to the emission of green- house gases (“GHGs”).5 Much of that work argues that traditional principles of public nuisance justify injunctive relief to cap further emissions of defendant polluters and monetary damages to compensate those already harmed by the climate crisis.6 The arguments for those remedies on that tort theory provoked the first iteration of climate change torts cases against emitters of greenhouse gases in federal courts. In American Electric Power v. Connecticut7 and Native Village of Kivalina v. Exxon Mobil Corp.,8 the courts promptly shut the doors on that line of cases––though importantly without rejecting the theoretical appli- cation of torts principles to climate harms.

The underlying torts justification for these cases is sound from both an instru- mentalist and corrective justice perspective. Put simply (and discussed in more detail infra), holding fossil fuel companies liable for adaptation costs internal- izes the externality these companies imposed upon society. Forcing them to bear that expense will both disincentivize further ubiquitous production and sale of fossil fuels and punish them for their prior bad acts. The former is an instrumental goal while the latter is a corrective justice goal. From the perspec- tive of climate policy, many have long maintained that some form of carbon tax presents the most efficient way to address both the sources and the effects of climate change.11 Liability for adaptation, particularly if streamlined and regu- larized by federal statute, would serve a very similar function in terms of align- ing economic incentives with climate mitigation policy. And focusing that liability on the relatively few actors who provide the root source of the green- house gas problem is the most efficient manner of creating those incentives. Furthermore, the necessity of adaptation, in addition to mitigation, is no longer a question for climate policymakers. The only question now is how much of it we will need and who will pay for it.12 A statutory adaptation liability scheme would answer that crucial second part of the policy equation. 9. See Karen C. Sokol, Seeking (Some) Climate Justice in State Tort Law, 95 WASH. L.

It should be noted that, unfortunately, national politics have seemingly regressed on the question of the necessity of addressing climate change through mitigation or adaptation over the past two decades. Many in Congress remain skeptical of the need to take action. See Justin Worland, Climate Change Used to Be a Bipartisan Issue. Here’s What Changed, TIME, July 27, 2017, https://perma.cc/JA7G-34UP.

It will do so by comparison to the paradigmatic example of statutory environmental liability – CERCLA. The first part looks at the parallel historical contexts in the early 1980s and the early 2020s. The second part explains why, just as with contami- nated property forty years ago, the torts system, without statutory uniformity, will prove an inefficient and inadequate solution to the crisis of environmental harm we currently face. The third part expands upon the affirmative case for CARLA from practical and theoretical perspectives. Finally, the work explains how three features came to define CERCLA liability—strict, joint and several, and retroactive—and how those features should function in CARLA. I. THE EARLY 1980S AND THE EARLY 2020S A. The 1980s Liability for destructive and harmful waste management did not manifest out of thin air in the late 1970s. The environmental movement of that decade simply brought new attention to an age-old problem. Records indicate that medieval common law courts in England recognized that release and disposal of waste may lead to a trespass cause of action.13 The moral obligation to clean up the pollution one causes dates back even further.14 Nonetheless, formal litiga- tion advancing these principles in the corporate context occurred relatively in- frequently in twentieth century America. It was not, as one might expect, a renewed surge in actual tort cases, but rather theoretical liability, that prompted federal attention to the problem in the late 1970s. Prior to the passage of CERCLA, tort litigation seeking compensatory or injunctive relief based on contamination of property by hazardous wastes was rare. The relevant reported cases from that time primarily involve the cleanup of oil spilled in or near drinking water supplies.15 Even cases seeking personal injury damages based on exposure to hazardous substances, so-called “toxic 13.

As that doctrine matured over time, courts defined increasingly narrowly the cate- gory of “abnormally dangerous activities” to which strict liability attached, re- sponding to a variety of efficiency-related arguments.18 Sites contaminated by hazardous waste still needed cleaning up, which was bound to be costly. In this area, legal and other transaction costs had the potential to dwarf the underlying problem and slow the necessary response. CERCLA provided a vehicle for consistency and cost allocation. The history of strict liability after CERCLA’s passage confirms the trajectory of the common law in this area of torts. As strict liability became commonplace for hazardous waste disposal under interpreta- tions of CERCLA, courts became more reluctant to impose strict liability for property damage caused by dangerous activities outside of the statutory scheme. By 1983, just three years after CERCLA’s passage, a report of the Superfund Study Group conducted under section 301(e) of CERCLA to evaluate the ade- quacy of existing common law and statutory remedies had concluded that a private litigant faces substantial barriers to recovery for property damage and personal injury.19 The state of the common law around CERCLA’s passage only partially set the table.

In practice, most states avoided the area of law. For example, prior to the Clean Air Act’s passage, although motor vehicle emissions were a known pollutant, only Cali- fornia took advantage of the jurisdictional opening by adopting new vehicle regulations in 1960. What’s more, the predecessors to the Clean Air Act of 197021 included several provisions that specifically provided opportunities for states to become involved in the regulation and control of interstate air pollu- tion, but the states largely declined the invitation.22 These included the oppor- tunity to associate in interstate compacts,23 to form interstate air quality control agencies in federally designated regions,24 and to set air quality standards for these regions.25 The story of lead paint regulation followed a similar pattern. The majority of states avoided the issue26 until the federal government stepped in and banned lead-based paint in the 1970s.27 Tort litigation under the common law was similarly rare following the federal ban, considered only by “activists” and ulti- 20.

However, many of these early attempts by local and state gov- ernments to regulate environmental harms were frustrated by the ease with which another city or state could undercut regulations and attract business, su- percharged by the ability of a single industry to overwhelm a single locality.31 This largely explains why many of the earliest federal laws simply provided financial assistance to states to support their governments in the face of corpo- rate resistance and potential economic pain.32 When that approach did not bear the desired fruit of cleaner environments, at least some state and local officials joined the push to pressure the federal government to step in more aggres- sively.33 Thus, pressure on the federal government to consolidate regulations 28.

The rise of the chemical industry and the increased reliance on chemical products for industrial and household use made salient the issue of human ex- posure to hazardous wastes.34 Several prominent environmental and public health incidents involving chemicals captured political attention. Most promi- nently, in the summer of 1976, twenty-five years after the Hooker Chemical Company stopped using the Love Canal as an industrial dump, toxic com- pounds leached into the backyards and basements of 100 homes and a public school built on the banks of the canal.35 The community demanded the federal government take action, and President Carter declared an emergency36 under the Stafford Act37 and called for swift congressional action. The Senate, specifi- cally, dug deeper into the history of toxic contamination, focusing on “three major pre-Love Canal incidents that came to national attention—the kepone contamination of the James River, the PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) con- tamination of the Hudson River, and the contamination of Michigan livestock by the ingestion of PBBs (polybrominated biphenyls).”38 And an EPA study documented the scope of the problem, cataloguing reported “hazardous mate- rial incidents” between 1977 and 1979.39 During the study period, EPA re- corded some 3,076 incidents, most of which were reported to the agency voluntarily.40 There was no question the problem was even bigger than the lim- ited data suggested. The risks of exposure to hazardous substances manifested in a wide variety of locations across the United States, affecting a wide swath of the population (if not all of it). 34. S. REP.

Although the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) prospectively addressed management and disposal of hazardous waste,41 it did nothing to deal with the thousands of existing sites already contaminated by past owners and operators, insolvent owners and oper- ators, or both. The contamination at such sites posed equal, or greater, risk to persons and property in their immediate vicinity than the risk posed by the future and ongoing hazardous waste storage, treatment, and disposal regulated by RCRA. The large number of existing hazardous waste sites could partially be attributed to the decades of under-regulation of disposal activities by state and local governments that preceded RCRA. The emergence of at least some of these environmental hazards paradoxically also resulted from the preceding dec- ade of tough regulatory statutes, RCRA among them. Increased oversight and regulation drove up compliance costs, which in turn drove many hazardous- waste-generating businesses to abandon operations. Consequently, by the end of the 1970s, the number and visibility of hazardous waste sites across the country were increasing.42 With respect to CERCLA, the nature of the problem—contaminated real property—affected both the push for federal action and the type of tool (i.e., a liability rule) selected. The importance of property ownership and accompany- ing capital and wealth accumulation feature prominently in the American story. As RCRA came into maturity, two market effects emerged. First, dealing with hazardous waste legally became more difficult and more expensive. Bad actors stored—or worse, just outright dumped—waste on their properties to avoid the complication and expense of compliance with new environmental laws and reg- ulations.43 Others who had been disposing of waste cheaply for years simply went out of business, leaving abandoned, contaminated sites in their wake.44 41. 42 U.S.C. §§6901–6908. 42. See James J. Florio, Congress as Reluctant Regulator: Hazardous Waste Policy in the 1980’s, 3 YALE J. ON REG. 351, 355 (1986) (“As Congress and the Administration learned more about past hazardous waste disposal practices and their effect on the environment, they soon realized that the country faced an environmental crisis. . . . Congress recognized that, aside from the regulatory problems addressed in RCRA, a remedial program was needed to clean up existing hazardous waste dumps. . . . In community after community, officials discovered sites where chemical wastes had been dumped in the ground for years, or even decades. The sites were simply abandoned, and in many cases the owners had disappeared. No one took responsibility for these abandoned sites, and the local, state, and federal governments had neither the legal authority nor the resources to clean them up.”). 43.

However, predictably, very few entities had any interest in acquiring them for fear of potential liability for either personal injuries or cleanup costs.45 At least with respect to allocating the latter species of liability, a federal liability statute presented an attractive solution. The congressional debate on the legislation that would eventually become CERCLA46 recognized these legal and practical realities. Starting in 1979, the United States House of Representatives introduced two separate bill packages and the Senate introduced one package. The legislative history of CERCLA itself is a conglomeration of the efforts on these predecessor bill packages, which eventually were superseded by the rather hastily constructed bipartisan compromise bill.47 The Chemical Manufacturer’s Association (“CMA”), as well as lobbyists for other industries facing potential liability, bent the ear of sympathetic lawmakers working on the proposed legislation that would become CER- CLA.48 The CMA was prominently and actively involved in negotiations over the eventual terms of CERCLA.49 Surprisingly, industry did not line up in complete opposition to a federal solution to the problem of contaminated sites. The CMA’s members opposed any increase in liability from common law prin- ciples (a point on which they ultimately lost) but had no problem with the government stepping in to help clean up so-called “orphaned” sites.50 On this latter point, for the CMA, and many members of Congress, the devil lay in the details. Everyone knew that a pot of money would need to be made available to assist with the cleanup of sites where no solvent liable party existed. Thus, a central feature of CERCLA negotiations had to do with how much money the 45. See Joel A.

The former two committees reported the bill out with no major changes about a year apart.54 The Ways and Means Committee, acting last, considered and proposed some amendments to the leg- islation.55 Of particular note, the committee marked up language around liabil- ity and added the phrase “jointly, severally and strictly liable for all damages.”56 In September of 1980, the House passed the bill with the amended language. The second House bill package, H.R. 7020,57 began in the spring of 1980 as the Hazardous Waste Containment Act. The bill proceeded to the Commit- tee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, which reported it out in the form of an amendment to RCRA that, similar to H.R. 85, imposed strict joint and several liability.58 Over in the Senate, S. 1480 was introduced and debated concurrently with the house debate of H.R. 7020.59 First introduced in the summer of 1979 as Environmental Emergency Response Act, the Senate sent the bill to the Com- mittee on Environment and Public Works, who subsequently referred it to a subcommittee, where it sat until the spring of 1980.60 The full committee marked up the proposed legislation and referred it to the Committee on Fi- 51.

The Senate drafters reasoned that under common law, hazardous waste disposal constituted an ultrahazardous activity subject to strict liability.70 This intent seems to have been endorsed by the case law establishing CER- CLA precedent over the following ten years.71 B. The 2020s The costs of climate adaptation will add up in the short and long term. Over just the next two decades, coastal communities on both sides of the United States will likely have to spend more than $400 billion to deal with unavoidable sea-level rise.72 Over that time, fourteen states in particular will see expenses of $10 billion or greater.73 Internationally, over one hundred countries will face at least $1 billion in costs.74 In the United States, the construction of more than 50,000 miles of coastal barriers, a popular adaptation structure, in twenty-two states will make the cost of just one important climate adaptation rival the price tag for the original interstate highway system.75 Looking specifically at coastal adaptation to account for sea-level rise as the emblematic example,76 the estimated costs are significant and widespread. More than fifty percent of the United States population resides in areas that will need to invest to adapt to rising seas.77 Adaptation strategies for municipal- ities facing the threat of sea-level rise have been consistently classified by the 69.

Indeed, the growing expense of flood insurance in the United States in the face of climate change has been the subject of much scholarly attention.85 By some estimates, thanks in large part to climate risk, the exposure of the United States government as an insurer could be as much as seven trillion dollars over the next seventy-five years.86 “Protection” involves the construction of infrastructure—such as seawalls, levees, dikes, and sand dunes—to protect existing residential and commercial structures in at-risk areas.87 This is the most frequently discussed adaptation strategy across all climate effects. It is relatively straightforward and is a tech- nique that society has employed for centuries (e.g., the Netherlands).88 This history, coupled with the ability to document and project costs of protection infrastructure, makes seawalls and similar projects the most frequently included in adaptation cost estimates.89 As between these options, the price tag, and resultant policy strategy, will differ by geographic location. Political constraints may make the least-cost so- lution nonetheless untenable.

Those costs differ by community, which is one important reason why a liability scheme with room for individual damages calculations makes sense.

The Houston area expects to spend thirty billion dollars.101 Boston, Norfolk, and Charleston each predict costs between one and three billion dollars.102 According to Mayor de Blasio’s administration, New York City will need to spend at least ten billion on a sea barrier.103 These major cities, and other communities like them, may well find a difficult path to funding necessary planning and construction. But many more communities dot both coastlines (and the Gulf of Mexico) and lack significant property and income tax bases. From small fishing towns in coastal Maine to agricultural areas in Florida, already-strapped local governments will confront a fiscal and physical challenge that scares even the wealthiest cities. Many communities will simply be unable to pay the bill. Confronted with the mounting costs of climate change, private and public parties have turned to the courts for relief. Thanks to the infamous AEP104 and Kivalina105 cases in the early part of the last decade, no federal common law cause of action remains viable, and thus the state courts have seen a flurry of activity.

Importantly, all of these causes of action sound in state law.110 The specific mix in the complaint of any individual public plaintiff depends almost entirely on the particularities of the jurisdiction’s caselaw.111 As the above discussion suggests, the climate impacts and necessary adaptation measures track similarly across the United States, with only the damages amounts differing. The three basic common law torts alleged in most cases are nuisance, tres- pass, and negligence. This is unsurprising. Nuisance and trespass form the ori- gins of environmental law, and negligence is in many ways the catch-all tort. Each theory has some challenges, and each embodies the “polluter pays” princi- ple. Nuisance comes in two varieties: public and private. Public nuisance arises when the defendants’ activity causes “an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.”112 Because these cases concern adaptation costs for public infrastructure (i.e., interference with common property), public nui- 106.

In order to prove public nuisance, the plaintiff governments will have to demonstrate how the marketing of fossil fuels and withholding of vital information led to the climate crisis we now find ourselves in, unreasonably imposing costs on coastal communities.113 The other tort forefather of modern environmental law—trespass—differs from nuisance in that it requires a physi- cal intrusion on property. Specifically, trespass occurs when an actor causes a physical boundary crossing onto the property of another without consent.114 If the intrusion causes actual harm, then the actor causing it need only have acted negligently or recklessly to be liable.115 Here, the physical intrusions are the effects of climate change, most notably the rising seas. In order to prove tres- pass, the plaintiff governments will thus have to demonstrate that the defend- ants produced and marketed fossil fuels with the knowledge that their activities were likely to cause sea levels to intrude upon public property.116 Finally, ordi- nary negligence imposes liability on actors whose unreasonable conduct causes injury to those to whom they owe a duty.117 The focus for the negligence in- quiry as it pertains to fossil fuel defendants will be the causal chain. All of these traditional common law torts theoretically fit, but each also present significant challenges of proof, particularly on the issues of intent and causation. The second category of causes of action included in litigation seeking to impose liability for climate adaptation grew out of traditional torts and contract 113.

A product that is defective in design is one that, when manufactured to specifica- tions, poses an unreasonable risk to an ordinary user.120 Manufacturers are also required by law to provide warnings on products when they knew or should have known that the normal use could cause harm.121 The fossil fuel industry put its products into the stream of commerce with full knowledge of the likeli- hood of climate change and the attendant harms. Consequently, under this theory of liability, the fossil fuel industry was obligated to consider reasonable alternative designs and provide adequate warnings of the consequence of using their products. In order to prove design defect, the plaintiff governments will thus have to demonstrate that the defendants failed to consider reasonable al- ternative designs to their products that would not have contributed as signifi- cantly to climate change.122 That could be a challenging but not insurmountable 118.

To prove a failure to warn theory, the plaintiff governments will have to demonstrate that at least some of the risks of climate change could have been avoided had the fossil fuel defendants warned consumers of the known poten- tial for global climate change from continued normal use of their products.123 As described herein (and in more detail in litigation documents), there is com- pelling evidence that fossil fuel companies did precisely the opposite—deflect- ing attention and deceiving the public.124 A number of states have consumer protection statutes that provide private and/or public causes of action.125 So-called “climate fraud” claims rely on these statutes to attempt to hold fossil fuel companies and their trade associations liable for misleading and deceptive marketing and promotion of fossil fuels. The same statutes provided the basis for some of the most successful tobacco litigation in the 1990s,126 as well as the recent wave of opioid litigation.127 Mas- sachusetts has a representatively potent version of such statutes128 and a piece of climate litigation relying on it.129 The Massachusetts statute declares unlawful “[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the 123.

Others will decide some or all of them on summary judgment. Still others may let them all proceed to a jury verdict. Due to the similar defendants across jurisdictions and the significant relief sought, even one success for the plaintiffs would have global implications. Add to that the unpredictability of jury awards, and the universal appeal of a federal statutory solution becomes clearer. The twenty-eight currently pending cases present some unique challenges and technically carry independent probabilities of success. At the same time, they share one major obstacle, and their fates are intertwined. The cases that have proceeded the furthest to this point span the United States—from Hawai’i to Oakland, California to Massachusetts (and a few in between). The first hur- dle any climate adaptation tort case inevitably confronts is avoiding removal from state to federal court.139 Because of the holdings in AEP140and Kivalina,141 if a climate tort case is sent to federal court, it is more likely it will be dismissed for failure to state a cognizable claim.142 Those cases involved the doctrine of displacement, which explicitly concerns whether a federal statute, here the Clean Air Act, replaces federal common law. Their resolution left open the possibility that the related, but substantially different, doctrine of preemption would not apply to foreclose state law tort claims.143 However, fossil fuel defendants argue that because of the federal interests involved in tort claims premised on global cuit split that we took this case to resolve and we believe the wiser course is to leave these matters for the Fourth Circuit to resolve in the first instance . . . . The judgment of the Fourth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.”). 139. Removal is the process by which a defendant can move a case pending before a state court to the federal district court in the same jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. §1446 (outlining the general steps for removal based on subject matter jurisdiction). So-called “federal officer removal” pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1442 permits the removal of claims against federal officers and agencies, including some entities that contract with the United States government. 140.

The question decided was whether, on an appeal of a district court’s remand order, a court may consider all of the potential grounds for removal. The scope of such an appeal was unsettled be- cause most remand orders are not appealable at all.152 By statute, remand deci- sions based on so-called “federal officer removal”153 were made subject to immediate appeal.154 The fossil fuel defendants in climate adaptation cases, in- cluding BP, raise federal officer removal as one of many purported grounds for federal jurisdiction. Thus, the district court’s remand order in Baltimore v. BP was subject to appeal in the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit limited its consideration to the federal officer removal grounds, deciding that other grounds for removal were not properly subject to appeal.155 The Supreme Court decided otherwise, holding that once properly on appeal thanks to the federal officer removal issue, any other issues in a remand order could also be consid- ered.156 Procedurally, the Supreme Court’s decision means that every remand order issued by a federal district court will be fully relitigated on appeal in the corresponding circuit court. Importantly, however, the Supreme Court said nothing about how the underlying issues should be resolved. In other words, federal courts around the country remain free to determine (based on their own interpretation of existing precedent from other contexts) whether climate adap- tation torts cases belong in state or federal courts.157 A lack of uniformity on 152.

Only in Hawai’i168 and Massachusetts169 have judges begun to grapple with more substantive grounds for dismissal advanced by the defendants’ pre-trial motions. The road from such motions to discovery and ultimately trial lies uncharted but will no doubt prove long, arduous, and expensive. From the plaintiffs’, and civil society’s, perspective, a federal statutory cause of action would provide similar advantages, vis-a`-vis the torts system, as CERCLA did in 1980. Like CERCLA before it, CARLA would impose at least some form of strict liability and dictate how to divide (or not) that liability amongst responsible parties. It would also likely impose that liability retroac- tively against fossil fuel corporations who may no longer be producing or mar- keting. CERCLA provided some much-needed clarity on these questions in an area where the real-world problems pervaded,170 but the existing theories of liability were largely untested.171 By the early 1980s, there was no question that contaminated toxic sites dotted the landscape, imposing real risks on communi- ties ill-equipped to protect citizens against them. The only question was who would pay to clean those sites up. Congress made the answer to that question more straightforward all across the United States by passing CERCLA. Since its inception, CERCLA has led to the identification and initiation of cleanup activities at almost 2,000 national priority list sites.172 Now, in the 2020s, there is similarly little question that climate change imposes real risks on communities similarly ill-equipped to protect against them.173 Americans again find themselves asking who will pay for the necessary protections. Congress has the opportunity to respond as it did four decades ago and create a comprehensive statutory liability scheme to answer that important question. The alternative is waiting years for piecemeal litigation to work its way through state court systems around the country, potentially reaching dispa- rate results, while communities take on debt to finance necessary adaptation infrastructure (or worse, decline to build it at all) without any assurance that funds will be recovered from any of the corporations responsible for the climate crisis. 168.

Causation and Adaptation Damages Calculations Accountability174 and attribution175 science have made the causation ele- ment of the above-described tort causes of action, and the damages portion of CARLA liability, possible to prove. Accountability work seeks to trace histori- cal greenhouse gas emissions to specific industries and companies, ultimately providing a quantitative assessment of relative culpability for the current state of the crisis. Attribution work seeks to causally connect specific impacts and events to anthropogenic climate change.176 These two pieces of the puzzle are essential to proving causation in any climate adaptation tort case. Plaintiffs will have to convincingly establish that (1) defendant fossil fuel corporations caused climate change (i.e., accountability) and (2) climate change concretely injured plaintiff communities (i.e., attribution). On the first question, a number of recent studies could help. In 2014, Richard Heede published a groundbreaking study tracing two-thirds of cumu- lative greenhouse gas emissions from the Industrial Revolution forward to the largest ninety fossil fuel and cement producers.177 The study also found that of those two-thirds of cumulative emissions, about half came after 1986.178 Ac- companying that study, Dr. Heede published the Carbon Majors Database,179 which gave birth to subsequent Carbon Majors Reports.180 The 2017 Carbon Majors Report updated the findings, tracing over half of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 to just twenty-five producers181 and over 174.

One such study from 2017 found that emissions from the ninety carbon majors accounted for between 42–50% of the rise in global mean surface temperature and 26–32% of the rise in global sea level since 1880.183 The study further found that from 1980 onward, those producers accounted for 29–35% of the rise in temperature, and 11–14% of the rise in sea level.184 Those are remarkably precise levels of fault, even for an ordinary torts case. How to inform a jury tasked with appor- tioning responsibility between multiple defendants has long been a subject of debate,185 with less precise calculations routinely admitted as evidence. None- theless, accountability science is still a niche and nascent field, and no court has yet had the opportunity to consider the specific studies mentioned here. After establishing that fossil fuel defendants bear a cognizable level of cul- pability for climate change itself, plaintiffs have to complete the causal chain by linking their specific injuries to climate change (rather than some other cause unrelated to defendants’ conduct). Causation is a tricky thing, and torts scholars love to debate its boundaries.186 Toxic torts cases infamously pose thorny problems of proof on the matter.187 Climate change torts, even those narrowly focused on adaptation, face a similar challenge. As Michael Burger, Jessica Wentz, and Radley Horton aptly describe it: “[t]he most fundamental challenge is that, as research moves further down the causal chain from human influence on climate change to discrete impacts on human and natural systems, research- ers must account for an increasing number of non-climate and exogenous vari- ables.”188 Even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) has acknowledged the difficulty in separating the impacts of anthropogenic climate 182.

Notwithstanding that difficulty of proof in a courtroom, science has con- tinued to advance. Recent studies demonstrate, with increasing confidence, that climate change causes injury to coastal communities,191 and then those studies attempt to quantify the injury.192 Those injuries lead to health, social, and eco- nomic damages, including the infrastructure and property changes discussed above, decreases in productivity, and scarcity of food.193 Tabulating the damages will involve large-scale accounting, but not necessarily advanced scientific mod- eling. The science comes in when lawyers need to connect the damages to the root cause. On that front, the most recent IPCC report made major strides in attributing specific extreme weather events to climate change.194 Annual reports from the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society include the most recent studies attempting to connect specific negative effects and events (e.g., flooding, drought, extreme precipitation) to anthropogenic climate change.195 One included study, for example, found that the probability of a roughly half meter flood in Miami had increased by more than 500% since 1994 due to 189.

This nascent science remains relatively untested before a judge or jury.201 A statutory scheme would alleviate the need to rely on this evidence for causation.

III. THE POLITICAL AND POLICY CASE FOR A STATUTORY REMEDY Parallels between the present and the early 1980s exist with respect to the torts’ uncertainty and the thorniness of responding to widespread environmen- tal impacts. Those parallels counsel for another legislative response. A legisla- tive response requires the legislature, a group of elected politicians, which makes a comparative assessment of the political climates essential to completing the case for CARLA. Unfortunately, it is indisputable that Congress is more polarized now than it was in 1980.205 That is not a good sign for CARLA. Recall that CERCLA became law during a lame duck session of Congress.206 As the above story re- calls, the road from President Carter’s pledge after the Love Canal disaster to CERCLA’s passage was not an easy one.207 Thus, even in a more moderate time, when environmentalism was less often a partisan issue,208 a liability-based solution to clean up the country needed some help to get across the finish line.

Some recent signs specific to this en- deavor do nonetheless provide a glimmer of optimism, which is worth illumi- nating here. Both Democrats and Republicans have proposed legislation in response, at least in part, to the growing body of adaptation torts cases in the states. The Republican-led effort unsurprisingly sought to immunize fossil fuel corpora- tions from liability. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, some republican lawmakers proposed an amendment to the relief bill that would have given the “energy” sector liability protections as one of the nation’s “lifeline functions.”209 The provision did not gain traction and never made it into law, though similar provisions continue to be the subject of study and debate.210 On the other side of the aisle, a group of democratic lawmakers have pushed the Polluters Pay Climate Fund Act of 2021.211 That legislation would impose a fee on any fossil fuel corporation responsible for at least 0.05% of the total carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions over the last twenty years and use the proceeds to create an adaptation fund, capped at $500 billion over ten years.212 This proposal is a retroactive carbon tax by another name, rather than a true liability scheme.

Such a compromise might still prove untenable (to either or both sides), but it is likely the only way a version of CARLA passes at the federal level.215 Prior to CERCLA’s passage, there is some evidence that state legislative action and judicial rulings favorable to the environment had left industry unset- tled and fearful of liability. Those conditions may have contributed to a less robust lobbying assault against CERCLA than one might expect, and perhaps even led some to push for federal legislation.216 The situation was not dissimilar to the one facing the auto manufacturing industry prior to the passage of the Clean Air Act—a myriad of state law requirements and court rulings engender- ing uncertainty and creating inefficiencies in production.217 The threat of multi- billion-dollar damages awards in multiple states could very well motivate the fossil fuel industry to accept a federal statutory solution. That motivation would shift from a nudge to a shove if even one of the cases mentioned above results in an actual judgment against fossil fuel defendants. As some of those cases move closer to that possibility,218 the pressure builds. Torts scholarship has long recognized a number of supporting rationales for imposing liability, including the two most salient to this endeavor—the in- strumentalist219 and corrective justice theories.220 215. The political viability of individual state statutes that impose liability on fossil fuel producers is a wholly different matter, at least in a subset of states where more progressive politicians possess legislative majorities. In the CERCLA context, state legislation abounds (though that effort followed the federal statute); 47 states have their own CERCLA-type statutes. See U.S. GOV’T ACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-13-633T, HAZARDOUS WASTE CLEANUP: OBSERVATIONS ON STATES’ ROLE, LIABILITIES AT DOD AND HARDROCK MINING SITES, AND LITIGATION ISSUES (2013).

Thus, under this the- ory, imposing liability on oil, coal, and gas companies to cover the costs of adaptation would make continued production of fossil fuels more expensive (perhaps prohibitively so) and consequently less prevalent (and eventually non- existent). The market, with the liability signals in place, would shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Adaptation liability then serves the instru- mental purpose of encouraging mitigation (through fuel shifting).223 Put an- other way, one might view the liability scheme discussed herein as a backdoor climate mitigation effort, a way to act on climate when direct regulation of emissions seems less and less likely at the federal level. Corrective justice theorists, on the other hand, build upon the retributive justice perspective imported from criminal law to explain why tort liability fo- cuses on rights and wrongs. In other words, liability exists to punish wrongdo- ers and redistribute ill-gotten gains to their victims.224 The ultimate goal of any liability scheme for these thinkers is fairness. The rationale applies rather straightforwardly to climate adaptation liability for fossil fuel producers, follow- ing the centuries-old environmental law trope of “polluter pays.”225 As detailed in the sections that follow, the costs of climate adaptation are already signifi- cant, and still growing. The silver lining, from a liability perspective, is that one can trace the primary cause of our climate crisis to the action (and inaction) of a single industry—fossil fuel. Corporations who make their business extracting these fuels from the earth and selling them to citizens and governments have, it turns out, known for decades that the emissions from their products would cause widespread and irreversible damages.226 To date, they have employed venge, 40 SAN DIEGO L.

Corrective justice theory posits that the imposi- tion of liability would fairly redistribute and repurpose fossil fuel profits to help repair the situation the industry’s wrongdoing created. From a climate policy perspective, imposing statutory liability on upstream producers to compensate communities for the costs of adaptation makes sense when compared to other options. As the pending cases demonstrate, state court trials do not always proceed with all deliberate speed, especially not when well- resourced defendants throw up every conceivable roadblock. A federal statutory liability scheme would streamline the process, facilitating the distribution of funds to communities who are in desperate need of them due to already salient climate effects. Further, choosing fossil fuel producers, rather than individual users, as the polluters who will pay makes practical and moral sense.227 On the practical side, it is much easier to identify and litigate or negotiate with a small group (one hundred or fewer) of corporate potentially responsible parties than an extremely large group of disparate consumers of fossil fuels (millions).228 And, inevitably, consumers will not be totally off the hook, as producers will certainly pass on some of the costs of liability.229 From a moral and tort theory perspective, fossil fuel producers are wrongdoers. They are not the only wrong- doers in the climate crisis; but they are the wrongdoers who acted with prior knowledge230 and who have the most ability to pay.231 IV. FEATURES OF STATUTORY LIABILITY CERCLA’s power has derived in large part from three distinct features of the liability it imposes. That liability is (1) strict, (2) joint and several, and (3) retroactive. CERCLA’s text was neither precise nor explicit as to the applica- tion of these principles and their scope, however.232 In the years following CERCLA’s enactment, these defining fundamental features took shape via ju- dicial interpretation of the statutory text.233 Much of the development of the 227.

First, Congress had succeeded in provoking a renewed effort to clean up contami- nated sites and recover costs for such. Second, Congress had failed to spell out the terms of liability with sufficient legal precision. Courts managed to preserve CERCLA’s power by interpreting the act in accordance with Congress’s pro- fessed intention that it provide a comprehensive response to the problem of sites contaminated by hazardous substances.235 Any comprehensive liability scheme for climate adaptation would be wise to track the defining features of CERCLA liability and do so even more explicitly than CERCLA initially did. As with the difficulty of using common law tort to make polluters pay to clean up contaminated sites in the 1980s, there are several challenges—many similar, some different—in applying common law tort liability to GHG emis- sions. In both situations, proving causation of any one of multiple defendants could be costly, risky, and scientifically daunting. GHG emitters, like the haz- ardous waste dumpers before them, will likely claim a de minimis individual contribution. The sheer number of emitters that exist as well as attributional challenges related to damage from climate change are other common problems to finding polluters liable. This causes problems in the establishment of duty. Thus, a strict, joint and several, and retroactive liability bill for GHG emissions could help overcome challenges to traditional common law causes of action as CERCLA did. It is useful to examine closely each of these features—how they originated in CERCLA text and caselaw and how they would apply to climate adaptation liability. A. Strict Liability Strict liability, or liability without fault, dispenses with the plaintiff’s obli- gation to prove intent, knowledge, or even negligence on the part of the defen- dant with respect to the activity or consequences in question.236 It is generally enough to prove simply that the defendant’s product (or activity) was unreason- ably dangerous.237 This makes it a powerful tool, applied sparingly under the common law to cases of product liability (i.e., defective products)238 and “abnor- 234.

By definition, CERCLA sites involve contamination from the use or disposal of hazardous or dangerous substances,240 which could very well be considered “ab- normally dangerous activity.”241 Perhaps it was the theoretical connection to other sources of strict liability that led congress to draft CERCLA’s liability provisions narrowly. Section 107 of CERCLA specifically delineates the parties potentially liable for cleanup242 and the limited defenses available to them.243 The four specific categories of potentially responsible parties are: (1) the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility, (2) any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of, (3) any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility or incinera- tion vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and contain- ing such hazardous substances, and (4) any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities, incineration vessels or sites selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a gaged in the business of selling such a product, and (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.”). 239.

In 1984, the Central District of California held that the legislative history “[m]ake[s] it clear that traditional tort notions, such as proximate cause, do not apply.”247 Other federal district courts held similarly, often in even more definitive language.248 The Second Circuit considered the issue on appeal and held that a CERCLA plaintiff is not required to prove that the acts of a defendant directly caused or contributed to the circumstance which required response action.249 All of these decisions came shortly after CERCLA went into effect.

Without it, players in industries that depend on hazardous substances would be able to disclaim liability by simply pointing fingers at each other. With strict liability, any industry participant is incentivized to not only avoid contaminating sites but to raise industry stan- dards so others do not do so either. The type of strict liability that courts have applied in CERCLA cases would work well for climate adaptation costs. Similarly, an industry has im- posed the most significant environmental externality of their operations on so- ciety. As discussed above,256 the largest fossil fuel companies have controlled the production and distribution of the primary driver of climate change. Their con- trol over fossil fuel is like the potentially responsible parties’ control over haz- ardous substances. In both instances, the imposition of liability without fault is key to forcing the industry as a whole to internalize the externality (i.e., to make the polluter pay). One can make a strong theoretical case for the common law strict liability in the case of fossil fuels. After all, the production and distribution (i.e., sale) of fossil fuels presents a fairly straightforward products liability situation. Indeed, the currently pending state tort cases all include claims of product defects.257 A statutory strict liability scheme would simply confirm that the law of products 251.

As with CERCLA, when fault drops out of CARLA’s liability equation, something else needs to define the bounds of the scheme’s reach. The four defined categories of CERCLA liability put an emphasis on control over haz- ardous substances and/or property that ultimately led to contamination.259 In this way the statute reached back to the root of pollution problem, rather than targeting individual bad actors. A parallel scheme for climate adaptation liabil- ity would emphasize the introduction and control of the underlying substance (i.e., fossil fuels) that generates greenhouse gas pollution. A directly parallel scheme would hold liable the following260: (1) the producer or distributor of a fossil fuel, (2) any person who at the time of distribution of any fossil fuel owned or operated any facility at which such fossil fuels were produced or distributed, (3) any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for production or distribution of fossil fuels, or arranged with a trans- porter for transport of fossil fuels, owned or possessed by such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility owned or operated by another party or entity and producing such fossil fuels, (4) any person who accepts or accepted any fossil fuels for transport to distribution facilities. The difficulty with such a rigid scheme is that it has the potential to cap- ture an unwieldy number of very small operators. In particular, the proposed sections (2)–(4) would impose liability on businesses of any size involved with the transportation and sale of gasoline, a category that includes a great number of sole proprietorships and family-owned businesses. Even larger fossil fuel en- tities would argue that, counted alone, each’s contribution is de minimis.261 In contrast to the defined geographic universe of a CERCLA site, any adaptation project theoretically implicates most, if not all, of the global universe of poten- tially responsible parties. Hence, a statutory climate liability scheme will need to use something more than geographic boundaries to identify the potentially re- 258. See supra Part II.B. 259. See 42 U.S.C. §9607(a). 260.

As mentioned above, one similar piece of already proposed legislation would impose a tax on any company responsible for at least 0.05% of the total carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions over the last twenty years.263 A liability threshold of that kind would track the carbon majors list fairly well, which would make scientific and policy sense. It would also be consistent with the approach to liability in the tobacco and opioid set- tlements.264 The ability to include such a threshold in a statutory liability scheme presents a significant advantage over the current state-based tort ap- proach. If no statutory liability scheme emerges for climate adaptation, state courts will likely resort to imprecise and inconsistent interpretations of what constitutes de minimis contribution absolving a defendant of liability. The second, less common category of common law strict liability concerns abnormally dangerous activity. The movement, use, or control of hazardous substances could very well be “abnormally dangerous.” But even there, tort law was reluctant to interpret that category so broadly.265 Fossil fuel production and distribution appear more innocuous on their own than use of hazardous sub- stances; many ordinary citizens transport propane or kerosene tanks in passen- ger vehicles, for instance. However, the documentation of the increasingly dangerous effects of climate change, along with the ability to more directly attribute those effects to fossil fuel activity, suggests something abnormal is afoot. There also exists precedent in the Clean Air Act for determining hazard based on chemical concentration over time, which is precisely the type of prob- lem the accumulation of greenhouse gases presents.266 Greenhouse gas accumu- lation is definitely not as clearly abnormally dangerous as some of the emblematic contamination cases like Love Canal where humans were suffering acute and significant harm resulting from exposure to certain chemicals. It is not dangerous per se to come into contact with carbon dioxide, but at scale the abnormal danger becomes apparent. In some ways, we are talking about hazards resulting from human and industrial activity. Industrial activity is often human 262. At a minimum, the fossil fuel producing entities within the state where an accountability action originates should probably have some liability. However, confining it to just those entities ignores the realities of atmospheric science and greenhouse gas emissions. 263. See infra Part II.B. 264.

Thus, we may be able to draw a line between inherently dan- gerous fossil fuel production and the type of production that does not rise to that level. Again, this type of line drawing would be important for a strict cli- mate liability scheme to function properly. B. Joint and Several Liability At common law, “joint and several liability” makes each of multiple de- fendants liable for the entirety of the plaintiff’s loss, regardless of relative culpa- bility or degrees of fault. Put another way, in the words of the Restatement, a plaintiff can “sue for and recover the full amount of recoverable damages from any [defendant].”267 This principle prioritizes the plaintiff being made whole over any one defendant potentially overpaying relative to the harm they caused. The alternatives (i.e., liability apportioned based on fault, ability to pay, or some other metric) increase the possibility that a successful plaintiff will still be less than whole in the event of an insolvent or recalcitrant defendant. Joint and several liability also puts the burden on the wrongdoers to apportion damages amongst themselves through contribution actions, rather than forcing the inno- cent plaintiff to prove separate damages amounts for each defendant. Once wrongdoing has been established, when faced with a choice between tortfeasor and victim, the morally justified option places the burden on the tortfeasor. At common law, joint and several liability attaches when two or more tortfeasors either act in concert or act independently but create an indivisible harm.268 The first category captures actors who coordinated to harm the plain- tiff and rightly holds them each fully responsible for the coordinated action. The second category addresses the concerns articulated above with respect to ensuring that a plaintiff is made whole. A relevant, albeit rare, variation on ordinary joint and several liability is what has been called “market share” liabil- ity. This rule may apply when a generic product causes an injury and there are multiple manufacturers of identical versions of that product.269 In such circum- stances, after the famous Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories270 case, a court may hold defendant manufacturers proportionately liable in accordance with their market share in the market of the good. 267.

Thus, most courts applied ordinary tort principles and held multiple defendants jointly and severally liable for indivisible harm.272 Contemporary scholars generally agreed.273 By the end of the first decade of CERCLA litigation, the Fourth Circuit aptly described the statute as permissive of joint and several liability for indivisible harm in 1988.274 In practice, joint and several liability became the default under CER- CLA.275 The statute included no requirement that all potentially responsible parties be included in an initial action pursuant to Section 107. And, further- more, if there was any doubt on the matter, Congress amended the statute to specifically contemplate that parties would seek contribution from one another, making such a cause of action explicit in Section 113.276 A contribution claim embodies a “tortfeasor’s right to collect from others responsible for the same tort after the tortfeasor has paid more than his or her proportionate share, the shares being determined as a percentage of fault.”277 As Justice Thomas ex- plained in Atlantic Research, this traditional tort understanding of contribution applies to CERCLA liability through §113(f).278 Such a cause of action is only necessary because Section 107 imposes joint and several liability in most instances.279 In response to joint and several liability emerging as the default in CER- CLA cases, potentially responsible parties turned to a “divisibility of harm” de- fense.

United States, “CERCLA defendants seeking to avoid joint and several liability bear the burden of proving that a reasonable basis for apportionment exists.”284 The Court went on to articulate two points on which proof must be sufficient: (1) that the harm to the environment is capable of division and (2) that a reasonable basis to apportion damages exists.285 In Bur- lington Northern, no dispute existed as to the first element, and so the Supreme Court only had occasion to comment on what constitutes a “reasonable basis” for the division of liability.286 The Court upheld a division based on the specific chemicals handled by the defendant, the percentage of surface area where de- 280.

With the benefit of CERCLA and common law developments, the drafters of CARLA can make explicit the ap- plication of joint and several liability to fossil fuel producers and the burden on them should they seek apportionment. The statute would then go on to specifi- cally articulate the factors and burden of proof. Assuming the universe of potentially responsible parties is limited accord- ing to one (or more) of the thresholds described in the prior section, the jointly and severally liable fossil fuel defendants would each have significant assets to contribute. There is no doubt they would try to argue divisibility. However, if the two-part Burlington Northern test applied, defendants would have a prob- lem on the first element. From one perspective, climate change is the ultimate indivisible environmental harm—greenhouse gases from diffuse sources aggre- gate and comingle to create a layer of pollution that is rapidly warming the earth.289 Looking instead at the harmful effects of climate change, though, could provide some basis for divisibility—adaptation costs differ depending upon whether the target is sea level rise or changes in precipitation or extreme weather events or any of the other well-documented climate effects. Under- standably, it is nonetheless impossible for attribution science to tie any of these specific effects to a specific fossil fuel producer. Climate effects are not chemical contamination. Fossil fuel entities’ contributions to climate change thus resem- ble CERCLA potentially responsible parties who all dumped the same chemi- cal on the same site at different times. As a policy matter, Congress could decide that the first Burlington North- ern factor is not necessary in the climate adaptation context and draft CARLA to reflect that departure from CERCLA precedent. In that situation, fossil fuel defendants would only have the burden of establishing a reasonable basis on which to apportion liability. As described above, the Carbon Majors Report potentially provides that basis.290 At least some members of Congress agree that dividing responsibility for adaptation costs proportional to contributions to fos- 287.

At least one scholar modeled how this might work in the related context of nuisance suits against greenhouse gas emitters.292 Hence, apportionment in the climate adap- tation context would much more closely resemble market share liability than divisibility under CERCLA.293 The justifications for recognizing market share liability do fit adaptation liability quite well. According to the Restatement, the appropriateness of mar- ket share liability depends on six factors: (1) The generic nature of the product; (2) the long latency period of the harm; (3) the inability of plaintiffs to discover which defendant’s product caused plaintiff’s harm; (4) the clarity of the causal connec- tion between the defective product and the harm suffered by plain- tiffs; (5) the absence of other medical or environmental factors that could have caused or materially contributed to the harm; and (6) the availability of sufficient “market share” data to support a reasonable apportionment of liability.294 Branded fossil fuels, especially after they are combusted and become carbon emissions, are indistinguishable from one another.295 A plaintiff would have difficulty proving which specific atmospheric emissions came from which com- pany, and similar difficulty proving which emissions represent the climate tip- ping point leading to more harmful effects. As one scholar put it, “a carbon is a carbon is a carbon”—where it comes from “makes no difference in terms of its impact.”296 Precedent exists for this approach; one of the only contexts where market share liability has been recognized outside of generic pharmaceuticals is environmental harm.297 Specifically, New Hampshire courts applied market 291.

Climate adaptation damages would serve the same function for a more widespread set of costs. A default of joint and several liability in CARLA would put the burden of justifying apportionment or seeking contribution on the fossil fuel producers held liable by the strict liability provision outlined above. That approach would create considerable transaction costs, but at least the majority of those costs would be borne only by liable parties (and not the plaintiffs). That approach would also do the most to ensure that state and local governments actually receive adequate compensation. An alternative approach would codify the ap- plication of market share liability principles to climate adaptation liability. That approach has sound basis in theory and recent precedent. Either way, CARLA must clearly articulate the scope of relative liability. It is not enough to do as CERCLA did and rely on traditional tort principles. C. Retroactive Liability A “retroactive law” is a law “that looks backward or contemplates the past, affecting acts or facts that existed before the act came into effect.”300 Retroactiv- ity is perhaps the most important feature of CERCLA liability. After all, the statute aimed to clean up sites that had already been contaminated. It would have been severely compromised on that dimension if it imposed liability only on the entities that owned or operated sites at the time of passage. Instead, CERCLA liability attaches to any party that fits into one of Section 107’s four categories at any point in time. Retroactive liability is a rare and powerful tool that departs from the common law norm.301 Negligence ordinarily judges the 298. See State v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 126 A.3d 266, 275 (2015) (affirming a jury finding “that Exxon’s market share for gasoline in New Hampshire during the applicable time period was 28.94%”). 299. Id.

Conse- quently, the source of CERCLA liability’s retroactive application must be the statute itself, not some underlying tort principle. Like strict and joint and several liability, however, the statute’s text did not speak explicitly on retroactivity. Some commentators initially pointed this out in forcefully arguing against its retroactive application.302 The relevant portion of Section 107 uses past tense verbs to describe at least some of the potentially responsible parties.303 Most significant of those provisions, Section 107(a)(2) imposes liability on “any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.”304 That provision makes the time of disposal, rather than the time of the statute’s enactment, the legally relevant point from which liability derives. Courts interpreting the statute relied on this language and the legislative history to conclude that CERCLA holds responsible parties liable for acts com- mitted before the passage of the statute.305 In particular, federal district courts in New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Colorado noted that CERCLA’s legislative history made clear that Congress intended it to be “backward looking.”306 By the mid 1980s, CERCLA’s retroactive application was seemingly settled law. Nonetheless, as the Supreme Court has considered the retroactive application of other statutes, some commentators have called for a reexamination of CERCLA.307 While a few lower courts have taken up that project,308 neither the Supreme Court nor Congress have waded in to change 302.

The prevailing interpretation remains that CERCLA imposes retroactive liability. Much like contaminated sites in 1980, the atmosphere is already polluted by greenhouse gases. While something might be done to mitigate its degree, climate change is a reality thanks to historical emissions. Those emissions can largely be traced to the fossil fuel industry and further isolated within that in- dustry to a subset of the worst contributors. Certainly, CERCLA-style retro- activity makes a great deal of sense, especially as newer and possibly disrupting geopolitical events and new industry may cause previous emitters to leave the market. All of these factors make retroactivity a necessary feature of any effec- tive climate adaptation liability scheme. However, in the case of greenhouse gas pollution, the relevant timescale is not as straightforward as industrial contamination. Most greenhouse gases are “stock” pollutants, capable of persisting in the atmosphere and warming the planet for decades, even centuries.309 In contrast, the contaminated sites CER- CLA sought to address dated at most back to the industrial revolution in the early twentieth century. Thus, the question in crafting CARLA is how far back to look when determining who is liable and, if apportionment applies, in what amount. The question is one of policy and one of scientific capability. With respect to policy, an appropriate cutoff would be the time that the fossil fuel industry possessed information indicating that climate change would result from their continued operation. Investigative journalism has uncovered reports to the American Petroleum Institute dating back to 1968 that warn of the dan- gers of carbon dioxide pollution and resultant global warming.310 Retroactivity at least to that date consequently comes with some supporting moral justifica- tion. With respect to science, Richard Heede’s seminal accountability work tracked contributions to climate change from fossil fuel producers all the way back to the 1850s.311 Much of the subsequent work has focused on a narrower window of time between the 1980s and today.312 Nonetheless, the existing body of scientific work indicates that lack of data will not constrain the reach of retroactive liability for climate adaptation. Instead, the policy question should determine the scope of CARLA’s retroactive application. There is no question that retroactivity is essential to any functioning cli- mate adaptation liability scheme. Adaptation is necessary at this point due to actions that will necessarily predate the passage of CARLA. Recent, post- CERCLA Supreme Court precedent indicates that the Court will generally 309.

This will undoubtedly come at a political cost, but it sets the necessary terms of debate given the current concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the inevitability of at least some warm- ing and associated adaptation costs. How far back in time the statutory liability reaches (rather than retroactivity at all) could be the appropriate subject of the almost certain political debate. CONCLUSION Climate policy in the United States faces a new reality. On the mitigation side, the ball has been passed to the state and local governments. If two decades of Congressional inaction were not enough evidence of this, the United States Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. EPA315 made it clear. Federal ac- tion, if it comes at all, will be too little, too late. With that realization comes increased importance of the other half of the climate policy equation—adapta- tion. Currently, the financial burden of climate adaptation sits with those same state and local governments. Many of them have wisely turned to the torts system to shift at least some costs to the corporations responsible for pushing fossil fuels with no regard for the environmental consequences. Some of their cases may succeed, and others may fail. That may be the end of the story. But as they sit pending, the federal government has the opportunity to take a lesson from history, step in, and fashion an efficient system of climate adaptation liability. A Climate Adaptation Resilience and Liability Act, or CARLA, would promote efficiency, appropriately redistribute the economic burdens of climate change, and, most importantly, help protect some of our most vulnerable citi- zens. Thankfully, as argued above, there exist some strong practical and politi- cal arguments to compel at least the drafting and introduction of legislation in Congress. Nonetheless, should those incentives prove less than motivating, I offer one final suggestion as to how interested citizens might increase pressure on the federal government.

No current federal law preempts them. States have for centuries modified the common law of torts within their borders by statute. A mini- CARLA would decidedly do nothing more than that, at least legally. Politi- cally, such a patchwork of state legislative action would likely have a similar effect to disparate litigation activity across jurisdictions—it would make a uni- form, federal scheme attractive to both plaintiffs and defendants. At the end of days, we may not think to ask who paid for the massive sea walls holding the rising ocean back from drowning us in our homes. But today, that question is still salient and, more than that, vitally important. We can let a bunch of state courts give different answers over the next decade. Or the federal government could enact CARLA. Let us hope that members of Congress have some of that ever-popular 1980s nostalgia.",

(b) Contribution (1) Contribution Any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section 107(a) of this title, during or following any civil action under this title. Such claims shall be brought in accordance with this section and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and shall be governed by Federal law. In resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate adaptation costs among liable parties based upon the relative por- tion of the geographic market affected that is controlled by each fossil fuel company defendant. (2) Settlement A person who has resolved its liability to the Municipality, State or Indian tribe in an administrative or judicially approved settlement shall not be liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the settle- ment. Such settlement does not discharge any of the other potentially lia- ble persons unless its terms so provide, but it reduces the potential liability of the others by the amount of the settlement. (3) Persons not party to settlement (A) If the Municipality, State or Indian tribe has obtained less than complete relief from a person who has resolved its liability to the United States or the State in an administrative or judicially approved settlement, the United States or the State may bring an action against any person who has not so resolved its liability. (B) A person who has resolved its liability to the Municipality, State or Indian tribe for some or all of a response action or for some or all of the costs of such action in an administrative or judicially approved settlement may seek contribution from any person who is not party to a settlement referred to in paragraph (2). (C) In any action under this paragraph, the rights of any person who has resolved its liability to the Municipality, State or Indian tribe shall be subordinate to the rights of the Municipality, State or Indian tribe. Any contribution action brought under this paragraph shall be governed by Federal law."
