The science of climate change is clear. As detailed in the New Jersey Scientific Report on Climate Change released by our administration last year, temperatures are increasing, sea levels are rising, and severe storms are becoming more frequent and intense. As the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida made painfully clear in September 2021, New Jersey's climate change risks are already manifesting across the state. These risks will only worsen in the years to come, with potentially devastating impacts to our communities, economy, public health, and the daily lives of our residents. The circumstances demand that we act with concerted urgency to promote and secure a more climate resilient future for New Jersey. Building climate resilience requires decisive and intentional action across all sectors and levels of government. Executive Order No. 89 (Oct. 29, 2019) jumpstarted this action, resulting in this inaugural statewide Climate Change Resilience Strategy, an iterative planning tool that will be continually updated in the years ahead. The Strategy outlines more than one hundred actions across six primary areas - recommendations that are intended to guide our institutions in building programs and policies that promote climate resilience. This Strategy is but a first step in a years-long effort to aid New Jersey communities and institutions in adapting to the realities of climate change. This inaugural edition could not and does not prescribe the detailed legislative, regulatory, and policy changes that must be developed through further public discourse. The Strategy establishes a baseline, suggests a prioritization of key public policy concerns, and presents a framework for continuous progress. Importantly, the Strategy acknowledges that climate change will not impact all New Jerseyans equally. The state's more vulnerable communities are already facing disproportionate climate risks and are likely to face greater adverse outcomes if equity and justice are not prominent and consistent features of the state's adaptation efforts. To that end, the Strategy places climate justice squarely at its center. Finally, we must note that this Strategy and the actions that must follow would not be possible without the dedicated staff of the Department of Environmental Protection's Bureau of Climate Resilience Planning and the thoughtful collaboration of representatives from across the seventeen state agencies that comprise New Jersey's lnteragency Council on Climate Resilience. Over the last two years, and amidst a global pandemic that has only solidified our commitment to preparedness, our administration assembled to develop this framework for ensuring New Jersey's resilience to climate change. Together with the emissions reductions proposed in the 2020 Global Warming Response Act 80x50 Report and the 2019 Energy Master Plan, the Strategy will further support our great state in responding to climate change through measures that protect our communities and environment, grow our economy, and lift all of our people. Together, we will meet this critical moment. Philip D. Murphy Shawn M. LaTourette Governor Commissioner of Environmental Protection Jane E.

Climate change poses an immediate and severe threat to the environment, human health and welfare, security, and the economy—in New Jersey, across the United States, and around the world. Rising sea- levels, increasing temperatures, more frequent and intense storms, and chronic flooding are among the noticeable changes that communities already experience. Furthermore, these impacts compound other challenges, such as, infrastructure conditions, inequality, and public health. Unfortunately, climate impacts and their secondary effects will worsen in the years ahead, even with aggressive emissions reductions due to the greenhouse gases that will remain in the atmosphere Current greenhouse gas mitigation initiatives are imperative to minimizing the long-term threats of a changing climate, but they are insufficient to protect New Jersey from climate change. Combatting climate change requires both aggressive actions to curb emissions, while simultaneously building resilience into the natural and built environments. Recognizing that New Jersey’s vulnerability to climate change cannot wait and requires coordinated leadership, Governor Phil Murphy signed Executive Order 89 establishing the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience in October 2019. This Interagency Council brings together seventeen agencies with responsibilities for maintaining the physical, environmental, and economic health of New Jersey’s precious resources and communities. The executive order also created the position of the Chief Resilience Officer for New Jersey and charged this position with delivering the state’s first Climate Change Resilience Strategy and Coastal Resilience Plan, with support from the Interagency Council. Enhancing the resilience of New Jersey’s communities, ecosystems, infrastructure, and economy requires an all-hands on deck approach to governing; the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience will lead this effort. “Climate change is the single greatest long-term threat currently facing humanity and effectively combatting it will require a whole of government approach” – Governor Phil Murphy This inaugural Resilience Strategy outlines the broad policy framework under which the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience’s work will occur. The scale of action needed to address climate impacts is unprecedented, and this Resilience Strategy is only the first step. Confronting climate change will require efficiency in the use of capital, maximizing co-benefits at every opportunity, and innovative solutions to ensure that New Jersey’s communities, landscapes, and economy are designed for the future, and not the past. Climate change will permeate every EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Governor Phil Murphy (center) signs an executive order to establish a statewide Climate Change Resilience Strategy on October 29, 2019 (Edwin J.

Nearly 9 million people call New Jersey home, making it the densest and one of the most diverse states in the country. The landscapes from the highlands to the sandy beaches of the barrier islands are as diverse as their people, cultures and history. Climate change will continue to place stress on these vibrant places and their residents, and fostering community resilience will require planning, innovation, decisive action, collaboration, and an unwavering commitment to sound, science-based decision-making. Key Outcomes • A statewide technical assistance program to support local climate resilience actions • Increased integration of climate change into local, regional, and state planning • Expanded support for workforce development and capacity-building across all levels of government • Focused resources and policies to address inequities in underserved communities 2 PRIORITY 2: STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF NEW JERSEY’S ECOSYSTEMS New Jersey is rich with beautiful mountains, lakes, rivers, and beaches that are the delight of its residents and tourists alike. The farms, forests, bays, and other ecosystems in New Jersey are vital to the state’s economy and identity as the Garden State. They also provide critical habitat to more than 3,700 wildlife species, from monarch butterflies to blue whales. With ecosystem services ranging from water filtration to flood attenuation to recreation, New Jersey residents rely on their natural environment for clean air and water regardless of where they live or work. These incalculable benefits afforded by the state’s healthy ecosystems are at risk from the impacts of climate change. Protecting our natural systems, minimizing environmental threats, and restoring degraded areas are critical to protecting the health and vitality of all natural resources in the state, as well as the benefits they provide to residents. Key Outcomes • Healthier ecosystems that are more resilient to climate change impacts • Enhancement of ecosystem services to benefit overall state resilience, including water storage and filtration, flood attenuation, carbon sequestration, and urban heat mitigation • Natural resources, agriculture, and public lands better positioned to adapt to environmental changes 5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYEXECUTIVE SUMMARY PRIORITY 3: PROMOTE COORDINATED 3 GOVERNANCE Climate change impacts will affect every aspect of state and local government, just as they will every sector of New Jersey’s economy, and every resident. State agencies need to consider climate change as part of business as usual for everything the government does. By viewing the operations of government through a climate resilience lens, New Jersey will be able to confront the coming impacts in a proactive manner. The Interagency Council on Climate Resilience brings these perspectives together to create a coordinated approach to addressing climate resilience. Key Outcomes • Efficient, proactive, communicative governance of statewide climate resilience policy through the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience • High level engagement and accountability across state agencies • Inclusion of local government and community leaders and their expertise in state resilience decisions PRIORITY 4: INVEST IN INFORMATION 4 AND INCREASE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING Climate change is the defining issue of our time. As a threat multiplier it will permeate every sector, resource, and community with wide- reaching implications. Increasing resilience to these impacts requires preparedness, and awareness is a key part of being prepared. It is critical that the state is using the best available information for its own decision-making and proactively sharing that information with residents, businesses, and other stakeholders. Key Outcomes • A multi-faceted public education and risk communication campaign • Improved data and methods for understanding climate resilience • Increased engagement from the public, business community, and all levels of government STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 6EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5 PRIORITY 5: PROMOTE CLIMATE-INFORMED INVESTMENTS AND INNOVATIVE FINANCING The scale of action needed to address climate impacts is unprecedented, requiring extraordinary efficiency in capital deployment and the opportunity to maximize co-benefits with every dollar. Both public and private funds will be essential to funding resilience actions throughout the state. Given the significant risks that climate change poses for current investments of public funds, climate risk assessment and avoidance becomes vital. It is important that the State prioritizes investment of public dollars into activities that serve the long-term economic needs and boost the resilience of communities, especially those that are least able to respond. Key Outcomes • Integrate climate considerations and fiscal risk from climate change impacts into funding criteria • Prioritization of socially vulnerable populations in funding decisions • Expanded use of private capital and innovative financing mechanisms to fund resilience 6 PRIORITY 6: COASTAL RESILIENCE PLAN The coastal areas of New Jersey provide infinite value as places of residence, tourist destinations, cultural and historic assets, ecological resources, and economic drivers within the state. While climate change will impact every area in the state, nowhere are the challenges more acute than the diverse communities of the coastal zone. Responding to the threats of sea-level rise, changes in coastal storms, and other climate impacts will inevitably change the look and feel of communities up and down the coast. Transforming state coastal management, increasing nature-based resilience measures, and encouraging proactive planning for sea-level rise and increased storm risk are the central goals of the state’s first Coastal Resilience Plan. Key Outcomes • An expanded tidal wetland monitoring program • Resilience incorporated into design of new development and redevelopment projects • Prioritization of state funding for coastal resilience projects to protect major population and economic centers, concentrations of critical infrastructure, and socially vulnerable populations • More private property owners adapting to climate change • Assessment of relocation policy opportunities and obstacles 7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYEXECUTIVE SUMMARY ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH In developing the plan, members of the Interagency Council gathered input from stakeholders through various events, including a summit on Coastal Resilience, several workshops, and smaller engagements with local officials, resilience professionals, and other experts. In spring of 2020, several scheduled outreach events that had been planned were cancelled due to COVID-19 transmission concerns. In lieu of the in-person events a webinar was 167 held in April and was attended by 350 participants. In addition to the opportunity to provide comment during Participants the webinar, there was also an electronic survey posted.

Some populations are more adversely affected factors of social vulnerability: socioeconomic status, age, by climate change due to pre-existing factors like age or gender, race and ethnicity, English language proficiency, ability; and for some populations, unequal impacts are and disability. Here, underserved populations refer to any also a result of historic and systematic inequities. Many socially vulnerable, environmental justice, or other low- socially vulnerable populations, environmental justice income and minority populations that have experienced (EJ) communities, and other Black, indigenous, and historic under or disinvestment and are disproportionately people of color (BIPOC) communities already experience burdened by or less able to prevent, respond, and recover socioeconomic and health inequities that exacerbate from adverse environmental impacts. the increasing risks from climate change and make it more difficult to adapt to changing climate conditions. Climate change creates new risks and is also a threat For example, for some individuals, factors like poverty, multiplier that compounds existing vulnerabilities and job insecurity, or special needs like autism, can make it inequities. Socially vulnerable populations and other more difficult to relocate during or after a storm. Others populations of concern often face both climate and non- may face greater health risks from heat waves or lower climate related stressors that contribute to underlying air quality because of age, race, or pre-existing health community inequities. These stressors might include conditions, such as asthma, or where they live. As social unequal access to health and economic resources, limited vulnerability inherently poses challenges to resilience social cohesion, high crime or violence, or disproportionate and adaptation, this strategy aims to respond to climate exposure to environmental hazards. Since environmental, threats and foster community resilience in an equitable socioeconomic and health inequities are inextricably and inclusive manner to prevent worsening existing connected, climate change’s devastating impacts on the inequality. physical environment can in turn create other negative impacts for socially vulnerable populations. By way of Socially vulnerable populations and underserved example, a person of low income who works outdoors populations are prioritized in this strategy. The Centers could experience increased economic vulnerability as heat waves become more frequent and too hot to work, resulting in lost wages. For socially vulnerable “BIPOC communities have been populations, underlying societal inequities and challenges subjected to living in segregated create the biggest hurdles to achieving resilience, and neighborhoods with more pollution, state agencies must consider and evaluate these issues as they create more opportunities for resilience. older infrastructure, and greater exposure to climate hazards, as well Research also points to the disproportionate impact that as lower income status, less economic climate change especially has on BIPOC communities mobility, and less access to quality and in the United States.ii This is often due to historic affordable healthcare.” discriminatory housing, environmental and investment policies, and exclusion from planning processes, among other factors. As a result, BIPOC communities have been subjected to living in segregated neighborhoods with more pollution, older infrastructure, and greater exposure to climate hazards, as well as lower income status, less economic mobility, and less access to quality and affordable healthcare. These pre-existing conditions make it more difficult for some BIPOC communities to adapt to climate change, and in fact can be exacerbated 9 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYEXECUTIVE SUMMARY by climate change impacts.

A strategy to create a resilient New Jersey requires in areas classified as addressing the needs and challenges of all New Jerseyans. “overburdened.” New Jersey’s approach to enhancing equity through climate resilience is three-fold. First, ensure climate change and resilience planning includes and is responsive to the entire community. State resilience planning efforts should be transparent, accessible, and responsive. Second, direct resources to build capacity in lower-resourced communities and foster local planning and resilience efforts driven by community leaders. Third, monitor resource distribution and outcomes to ensure that the state sees appropriate reductions in risk and measurable increases in resilience within all communities across the state. Across all six priorities in this strategy, state agencies are committed to improving resilience for those communities that face the steepest challenges in addressing the risks of climate change. Environmental Justice and Climate Change In 2018, Governor Murphy issued Executive Order 23, which recognizes the historic and ongoing disproportionate exposure to various environmental burdens faced by many of New Jersey’s low-income communities and BIPOC communities. The order directs the executive branch to ensure that the principles of environmental justice (EJ) are at the core of state policies and programs. To guide State decisions and the integration of EJ into executive agencies’ core functions, the Department of Environmental Protection issued “Furthering the Promise: A Guidance Document for Advancing Environmental Justice Across State Government.” The document provides a path forward for agencies to apply principles for furthering the promise of EJ in New Jersey, as identified by impacted communities and decades of local, state, and federal experience. In 2020, the state legislature strengthened the state’s commitment to addressing environmental justice through the passage of a law mandating the Department of Environmental Protection evaluate the environmental and public health impacts of certain facilities on overburdened communities when reviewing certain permit applications. Signed by Governor Murphy in September 2020, this landmark legislation will help curb pollution and cumulative and secondary impacts for the approximately 4.5 million individuals living in areas classified as “overburdened” by the legislation, and around the state. i Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2015.

Socially Vulnerable Populations • Young children, elderly, socially or linguistically isolated, economically disadvantaged, and those with preexisting health conditions will be more at risk to health impacts from the combination of heat stress and poor urban air quality. Infrastructure • Aging public water supply infrastructure and demands are vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. • Existing treatment infrastructure in New Jersey is not designed to treat elevated salt levels and drinking water standards do not exist for the primary components of saltwater. Health and Wellbeing • The effects of climate change are likely to contribute to an increase in air pollution, lead to increased respiratory and cardiovascular health problems. • Urban populations are particularly vulnerable as climate models predict an increase in the number of days per year with temperatures affecting human health due to heat stress. 13 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYclimate change impacts - how will new jersey be affected? EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Ecosystems and Wildlife • Climate change is likely to facilitate expansion of invasive plant species. • 29% of New Jersey’s bird species are vulnerable to climate change. Coastal Communities • “Sunny day flooding” will occur more often across the entire coastal area of New Jersey due to sea-level rise. • Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to flooding from storm surge and increased intensity of coastal storms. Agriculture and Food Supply • The productivity of crops and livestock are expected to change due to the climate- induced changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. Oceans and Marine Life • Ocean acidification not only threatens the health of the oceans, but also the economic value that people and industries depend on.

Resilient NJ The Resilient NJ program, managed by DEP, provides funding and technical assistance for local and regional climate resilience planning. The current round of funding, provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development through the National Disaster Resilience Competition, was awarded to develop four long-term regional action plans across 24 municipalities in the coastal zone. Information on these projects is available at Resilient.nj.gov. The program assists municipalities with the following: • Provide local resilience guidance to communities • Assess current and future flood risk through 2070 from rainfall, storm-surge, and tidal flooding • Develop innovative and implementable solutions that increase climate resilience in both the short-and long-term • Reach underserved populations, ensure representation and participation from socially vulnerable populations, and co-development of equitable solutions • Identify projects that enhance the value and integrity of ecological, recreational, and economic resources • Put these plans into action using set-asid e project funds The Resilient NJ: Local Planning for Climate Change toolkit, is a resource for communities in New Jersey to proactively plan for the changing climate and build resilience into their local governance. Communities that utilize the guidance can meet their obligations under the Municipal Land Use Law requirements, state Hazard Mitigation Plan requirements, and Plan Endorsement requirements. The resources within the local resilience guidance will also help communities integrate equity considerations into climate resilience planning. This toolkit will be available in early summer 2021.

In response to a survey, stakeholders ranked guidance and funding as two key investments the state could make to support local resilience efforts. This idea is not necessarily new; building local capacity is a long-standing objective of several ongoing programs across the Interagency Council. Programs such as Watershed Ambassadors and the Community Collaborative Initiative at DEP, and the Local Assistance Bureau at the Department of Community Affairs (DCA), the Department of Transportation’s Local Aid Resource Center, supplement local resources with on-the-ground expertise. The DEP Bureau of Flood Engineering provides floodplain management assistance to local communities throughout the state through their National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Community Assistance Program. The program reaches out to each municipality participating in the NFIP through a five-year cycle of Community Assistance Visits, Community Assistance Contacts, technical assistance, and workshops and other training. Maintaining an understanding of the requirements of the NFIP in each of these municipalities presents a considerable challenge, particularly when there is a high turnover rate among local floodplain administrators.3 19 STRATEGY 1.2 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYDRAFT PRIORITY 1: BUILD RESILIENT AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIDERS AFT In addition to providing direct technical assistance, 2020 Climate Resilience the state oversees technical professionals who advise Survey Results municipalities through various licensing programs.

There are other rules, policies, or existing statutes that may need to be revised to respond to the harmful impacts of climate change. For example, the authority for the state’s oversight of the Uniform Construction Code does not allow for consideration of future conditions. The current building code was adopted in 2019 and is based on the International Building Code/2018. The DCA has identified future updates that incorporate climate resilience as a necessary next step but does not have the authority to modify it as often or in ways necessary to respond to climate change. The statute that grants DCA its “New Jersey remains authority for this function limits the agency to adopting sections from the International Construction Code Council.

In New Jersey, there are no statutory or regulatory requirements for real estate disclosures from the seller. While the state courts have ruled that sellers must provide knowledge of material defects, the requirements related to current or future hazards are unclear. In contrast, many states have disclosure forms that provide critical information to the buyer, including flooding history and insurance obligations. Currently, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma have the strongest real estate disclosure laws in the country.4 Disclosure requirements might include improving access to elevation certificates, substantial damage determination letters, and/or requiring flood zone disclosure and documentation of past flooding. These actions would allow potential buyers to fully evaluate monthly mortgage costs and weigh the disaster recovery costs prior to making an offer on a property. Enacting disclosure laws would further resilience by encouraging the seller take mitigation actions before the sale or informing the buyer of the costs to bring the house into regulatory compliance. Other Interagency Council actions will work to improve compliance with existing regulations, as well as track regulatory programs to monitor effectiveness, and continue to encourage municipalities to exceed federal minimum standards provided by the NFIP. New Jersey’s Global Warming Response Act 80x50 Report recommends that the legislature expand DCA’s authority allowing more flexibility in modifying codes and subcodes to address climate change.

In addition to the exposure of these systems, one significant threat to infrastructure from climate change is the increasing cost of maintaining infrastructure approaching or beyond its design life—maintenance that is already chronically underfunded. Without even considering climate impacts, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that there is already a $1.2 trillion gap nationally in transportation infrastructure needs.

While these efforts may not reduce exposure to hazards directly, they contribute to the collective climate change mitigation goals of the state, and if targeted appropriately, can support the social and economic resilience of our communities. New Jersey Economic Development Authority Programs The New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) has numerous lending activities and real estate development activities that can promote climate resilience, sustainable development, job creation and as a result, advance a stronger, fairer New Jersey economy. One central effort at the NJEDA is developing a robust Offshore Wind energy program. The NJEDA actively participates on the Interagency Taskforce on Offshore Wind and recently introduced the “Offshore Wind Technical Assistance Program” to support local companies in the development of the skills and competencies necessary to participate in the Offshore Wind industry. In addition to creating jobs through new innovative sectors, the NJEDA is committed to investing in community revitalization through its Brownfields Loan Program. This program provides financing to potential brownfield site purchasers and current brownfield sites that intend to develop commercial, such as manufacturing or retail, mixed-use developments, expansions or reuses. The NJEDA has included questions in its loan application, which was approved by the Board of Directors on November 14, 2019, to evaluate the extent of sustainability measures and resiliency considerations undertaken by applicants. Both the Offshore Wind program and the Brownfields Loan Program exemplify the opportunities to invest in communities and create jobs, while strengthening the physical and economic resilience of New Jersey.

Other impacts include shifts in vector-, food- and waterborne diseases, as well as changes in the quality and safety of air, food, and water.11 In 2021 the DEP and the Department of Health will release an addendum to the Scientific Report on Climate Change that details the latest research on these impacts. Using this resource as a guide, the Interagency Council will work to integrate public health considerations into resilience activities and increase capacity of local health departments and state programs to prepare for climate change. This effort will include a focus on leveraging resources to monitor, assess, and respond to public health impacts of climate change. The COVID-19 crisis has clearly illustrated the interconnections between public health, economic stability, and community resilience. Integration of climate change resilience and public health efforts has four primary benefits. First, climate change exacerbates many drivers of poor health outcomes, such as air quality, complicating the interventions necessary to reach public health targets. Modifying the interventions to incorporate climate change improves effectiveness of these efforts. Second, the overlap between public health interventions and resilience interventions allows 27 STRATEGY 1.6 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYDRAFT PRIORITY 1: BUILD RESILIENT AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIDERS AFT for resource efficiency and maximization of co-benefits. air and water quality, and supporting maternal and child For example, expansion of green infrastructure may also health.

This requires removing obstacles to health such as poverty, discrimination, and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, safe environments, and health care.”16 Many health disparities stem from inequities in the opportunities and resources that foster health and well-being. Social determinants of health include living and working conditions, education, income, neighborhood characteristic, social inclusion, and medical care. These social constructs have continually experienced inequitable public investment and harmful public policies that are linked to current inequality metrics. Improving health equity requires increasing opportunities to be healthier for everyone and removing barriers to health, focusing particularly on those who face the greatest social obstacles and have worse health.

To be resilient, New Jersey must ensure that its ecosystems are resilient. The health of an ecosystem directly affects the health and well-being of New Jersey residents who live and work near them and the economies that rely on those ecosystems. If water quality is poor, for example, ecological, human, and economic systems suffer. The Interagency Council recognizes that a wholistic approach to climate resilience must strengthen the resilience of our ecosystems. As a priority, strengthening ecosystems serves as a resilience strategy in two ways. First, by supporting the health and diversity of ecosystems, they continue Tree frog in the Pine Barrens to provide valuable services as the climate changes. These ecosystem services are an important tool for building resilience. With ecosystem services ranging from water filtration and flood attenuation to food production and carbon sequestration, New Jersey residents rely on their natural environment for clean air and water regardless of where they live or work. Though their intrinsic value is priceless, the value of ecosystems goes far beyond aesthetics and recreation. In financial terms, the annual value of ecosystem services in New Jersey was estimated to be $8-19 billion,1 many of which will lessen the impacts of climate change. Second, nature-based interventions can be less expensive alternatives to hazard mitigation or hard engineering measures, while providing additional value and services. For example, some the most valuable and cost-effective of those mitigation services come from wetlands, which also provide vital habitat and opportunities for recreation.2 Beaver Habitat at the Plainsboro Preserve “The health of an ecosystem directly affects the health and well-being of New Jersey residents who live and work near them and the economies that rely on those ecosystems.” STRATEGIES: 2.1 Promote Resource Conservation and Natural Lands Management to Strengthen Ecological Resilience 2.2 Manage Agricultural Lands, Forests, and Other Ecosystems for Climate Impacts and Environmental Stressors 2.3 Deploy Natural and Nature-based Solutions for Resilience STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY 32PRIORITY 2: STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF NEW JERSEY’S ECOSYSTEMS STRATEGY 2.1: Promote Resource Conservation and Natural Lands Management to Strengthen Ecological Resilience ACTIONS 2.1.1 Consider future climate conditions in conservation and protection decisions 2.1.2 Expand protection of lands and waterways to safeguard ecosystem health Stokes State Forest New Jersey’s natural areas are valued as natural, scenic, and recreational 2.1.3 Restore damaged and resources for public use and enjoyment. State parks, nature preserves, degraded ecosystems to rivers, and open space are often thought of as perfectly preserved areas enhance their ability to set aside for the enjoyment of their visitors. Though idyllic, this surface- perform resilience-related level view of natural lands and resources does not recognize the values services and services these areas provide or the vulnerabilities they face. The warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns projected due to 2.1.4 Provide habitat climate change will result in these special places looking and functioning connectivity and corridors differently, which can impact water quality and supply, flood protection, to support wildlife and air quality in adjacent communities. The ability of ecosystems to adapt adaptation to changing to changing conditions is thus important to the state’s overall resilience to conditions climate change. If forests in a public space are unable to adapt to a changing climate, for example, the surrounding community may face locally higher temperatures and diminished air quality. As a threat multiplier, climate change will exacerbate the impacts of existing stressors such as pollution, fragmentation, and invasive species, threatening the ability of nature to serve its critical functions. Protecting our natural systems and restoring degraded landscapes ensures the existence of our cherished natural areas, but also serves to safeguard our communities from the impacts of climate change by using the power of nature itself. Importantly, protecting these resources also helps reduce the greenhouse gas pollution that drives climate change. Through this strategy, the State will use its conservation efforts to strengthen ecological resilience and use ecosystem services to address climate threats. Although not initially created with climate change in mind, several existing land management and preservation programs help promote resilience. For example, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) administers the Green Acres Program to protect open space as well as natural, historic, and cultural areas for public use and enjoyment. By creating a system 33 STRATEGY 2.1 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYPRIORIDTYR 2A: SFTTRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF NEW JERSEY’S ECOSYSTEMS DRAFT of interconnected open spaces, the Green Acres Program preserves and enhances New Jersey’s natural environment, and in turn, its resilience to climate change. Together with public and private partners, the Green Acres Program has protected over 500,000 acres of open space around New Jersey. Due to fiscal constraints, there are often more potential properties to protect than funds to protect them. Conservation programs use a variety of factors to prioritize where to spend their limited resources; some statutory, some policy. During that prioritization process, future climatic conditions should be taken into consideration. These large contiguous preserved lands will support wildlife as it begins to move to more suitable areas. The DEP has begun to plan for facilitation of that movement through its Connecting Habitat Across New Jersey (CHANJ) program. CHANJ is an effort to make landscapes around the state more permeable to wildlife by identifying key areas and actions to achieve habitat connectivity. Riverine connectivity is equally important for promoting healthy species populations. Removing antiquated dams, where appropriate, can improve ecological conditions while also increasing flood resilience in nearby communities. By using the best-available science in programs such as CHANJ to inform preservation and conservation decisions, state agencies can help ensure that investments in nature will be best targeted and protected from loss. Setting aside pristine lands and waters is not the only ecological approach to resilience in which the Interagency Council sees value. Restoring degraded resources to their natural status is also a useful tool for building resilience to climate change. Degraded areas that have been negatively impacted by pollution or hazards have diminished value for our communities and our resilience. The DEP’s Office of Natural Resource Restoration works to restore and enhance damaged resources, which expands ecosystem services and revives ecosystem health to the benefit of local communities. Restoration is not limited to contaminated sites. For example, the DEP’s Blue Acres program has restored a floodplain ecosystem in Linden, Union County in an area where it acquired frequently flooded properties through its floodplain buyout acquisitions. The Linden project not only increased flood resilience, but also enhanced the ecological functions of the area. Capturing the synergies between ecological restoration and community resilience is thus a powerful strategy for New Jersey. Nantuxent Wildlife Management Area Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) In October 2019, the DEP announced $13.5 million dollars in funding to implement innovative projects and technologies to mitigate and prevent harmful algal blooms (HABs) in lakes and public waters throughout New Jersey.3 Naturally occurring in lakes and ponds, the algae-like bacteria that causes these blooms can proliferate to unsafe, levels and produce toxins under certain conditions, including warm weather, high-nutrient, stagnant waters, and sunshine. Climate change is expected to exacerbate the problem of HABs, resulting in an acute public health threat from drinking and recreating in affected waterways. Ecosystems, wildlife, pets, and livestock can also be negatively impacted. In turn, businesses that rely on the use of New Jersey’s waterways are also impacted. The State’s investment to protect waters that are vulnerable to harmful algal blooms in turn boosts the resilience of those waters and communities that rely on them.

A key element of protecting managed landscapes to promote resilience is to mitigate and prevent hazards that negatively affect the environment, such as wildfires. The approach to building resilience to the threat of wildfire is twofold: understand the risk and conduct preventative management. To that end, the NJ Forest Fire Service (Service) is developing a Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal (WRAP) to provide a standard tool for quantifying and interpreting wildfire hazard and risk statewide. With the information from WRAP, the Service can target preventative management in at-risk areas. Foresters have many management techniques which help reduce wildfire risk across the state and enhance forest health. These include treatments 35 STRATEGY 2.2 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYPRIORIDTYR 2A: SFTTRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF NEW JERSEY’S ECOSYSTEMS DRAFT continue to evolve and new data becomes available. This method of adaptive management takes an iterative approach designed to expect and respond to uncertainty and variability of resources over time. By incorporating adaptive management and future conditions into planning, managers can ensure that their resources are best prepared for a changing climate. Fisheries, for example, are a vital component of New Jersey’s economy, supporting important recreational and commercial opportunities valued at approximately $2 billion annually.6 Yet, ocean Prescribed Burning acidification poses serious threats to marine environments and the fisheries they support due to changes in the “A key element of protecting managed chemistry of ocean water.7 As the ocean becomes more landscapes to promote resilience is to acidic, shellfish become weakened and their survival is threatened.

Projects in this State-Federal partnership will include living shorelines and beach nourishment, developing firebreaks, and enhancing stormwater management in the communities and landscapes adjacent to military facilities. In response to the impacts that climate change will bring, resource managers must not only prepare for random and unpredictable events like wildfires, but also for the more predictable changes in environmental conditions that the science projects.

Natural and nature-based solutions are resilience interventions that utilize natural ecological processes to reduce negative environmental impacts. Some common examples include trees reducing heat impacts, living shorelines that protect against erosion, and green infrastructure vegetation that absorbs precipitation. Natural and nature-based solutions can complement or act as alternatives to gray or hard infrastructure projects. These softer methods are frequently more cost- effective and can even outperform traditional approaches. For example, a 2014 study found that areas with more natural shorelines were better protected from erosion during Hurricane Irene than those with bulkheads.8 Natural and nature-based solutions also often offer the additional benefit of providing ecosystem services beyond just the intended use, including beautification, carbon sequestration, habitat creation, and recreational opportunities. Under the Department of Transportation’s Complete and Green Streets for All guidance, the agency promotes integrating natural features into transportation improvement projects as a method to capture those powerful co-benefits. 37 STRATEGY 2.3 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYPRIORIDTYR 2A: SFTTRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF NEW JERSEY’S ECOSYSTEMS DRAFT A survey of stakeholders during the development of this Climate Change Resilience Strategy revealed that participants want to see state agencies “Residents in urban increase the use of nature-based measures more than any other type of and environmental action.

As the state government invests in natural infrastructure across New Jersey, targeted investments should be prioritized in underserved communities. Residents in urban and environmental justice communities are disproportionately affected by climate impacts, such as extreme heat. Using green infrastructure and community forestry in these and other communities will provide incredible co-benefits to local areas, such as expanded open space. Similarly, planting urban trees not only reduces heat impacts, but also helps clean the air, store stormwater, and add aesthetics to communities. Given limited public resources, using diverse, cost-effective nature-based options allows state agencies to support underserved communities, while confronting climate impacts and Liberty State Park maximizing ecosystem services. In 2015, Stevens Institute of Technology developed Living Shorelines Engineering Guidelines to ensure living shorelines projects are designed, permitted, and constructed in a consistent manner using the best available information. STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY STRATEGY 2.3 38PRIORITY 2: STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF NEW JERSEY’S ECOSYSTEMS Pervious pavement, landscaping, and bioswale areas captures stormwater runoff. Green Infrastructure in Stormwater Rules Stormwater runoff is a major source of water pollution throughout New Jersey and across the nation. Every day, runoff from storms carries fertilizers, pesticides, automotive fluids and other pollutants into waterways, degrading ecosystems and impairing lakes, streams, and rivers. Poorly controlled stormwater also exacerbates dangerous flooding conditions, and the increase in projected rainfall and extreme weather due to climate change creates added risk for harm to people and property from stormwater runoff. In March 2020, DEP formally adopted amendments to the state’s stormwater management rules to better protect water quality by reducing polluted runoff through use of green infrastructure technologies. The amendments include a requirement for permit applicants to use green infrastructure, rather than more traditional engineered structures, to reduce stormwater runoff and achieve water quality goals. Green Infrastructure is typically used to refer to methods to manage stormwater through approaches that mimic natural hydrologic processes in developed areas. This approach more naturally manages stormwater, allowing better infiltration of above-ground stormwater into the ground water deeper beneath our feet. This infiltration process is simple and nature-based: it uses vegetation and soil to naturally filter out pollutants. Green infrastructure can also include ways to store some stormwater runoff for later beneficial reuse, such as irrigation. In addition to protecting and better managing stormwater, these approaches beautify communities and help in the fight against climate change by creating carbon-sequestering green space. Creating these green spaces also mitigates the heat-island effect caused by development and pavement, which can raise average temperatures in urban areas relative to less developed areas. 3399 STRATEGY 2.3 SSTTAATTEE OOFF NNEEWW JJEERRSSEEYY CCLLIIMMAATTEE CCHHAANNGGEE RREESSIILLIIEENNCCEE SSTTRRAATTEEGGYYPRIORIDTYR 2A: SFTTRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF NEW JERSEY’S ECOSYSTEMS DRAFT priority 2 notes: 1 New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. 2007.

STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY 40PRIORITY 3: PROMOTE COORDINATED GOVERNANCEPRIORITY 3: PROMOTE COORDINATED GOVERNANCE INTRODUCTION Climate change impacts will touch every aspect of state and local government, just as they will affect every sector of New Jersey’s economy, and every citizen of the state. In practice, this means that the State must come together to enhance resilience to climate change impacts. Without a concerted effort to address climate change impacts, the state government would risk being unprepared, disorganized, or with inconsistent and conflicting approaches to complicated problems. Executive Order 89 mandates that the Executive Branch “shall take proactive and coordinated efforts”i to promote resilience; a whole-of-government approach to climate resilience that is necessary and required. State agencies build on the foundation of Executive Order 89 by expanding opportunities for collaborative governance. Therefore, state agencies must integrate climate change into all practices, making it business as usual and not a supplementary consideration. By viewing the operations of government through a climate resilience lens, the state government will be able to confront the coming impacts in a proactive manner. This priority proposes actions that will establish the processes and governance structure necessary to confront climate change as a unified state government.

To rise to this challenge, New Jersey’s institutions must evolve to reflect that climate change is a threat to their missions and 3.1.3 Create resilience action constituents. Addressing climate change requires a level of integration, plans at each agency with mobilization of resources, political will, and sustained commitment that standard goals and metrics can only be driven through government-wide leadership. The Interagency Council on Climate Resilience (Interagency Council) established by Governor Murphy’s Executive Order 89 was designed to fill that role. 3.1.4 Share data across agencies Governor Murphy also signed Executive Order 221 establishing the through an interagency Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy, which will focus on web portal the interlocking priorities of addressing climate change, ensuring New Jersey’s clean energy future, and transitioning to a green economy while 3.1.5 Share information that may prioritizing equity and environmental justice.

This clear mandate empowers the group to take a leading role in developing statewide climate resilience policies beyond the development of this document. In a leadership capacity, the Interagency Council is tasked with spearheading resilience policy development, providing guidance and standards to agencies, and coordinating and driving state resilience actions across the 43 STRATEGY 3.1 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYPRIORITY 3: PROMOTE COORDINATED GOVERNANCE entire Executive Branch. The Interagency Council will use issue-specific working groups, frequent information sharing, and a shared vision for ACTIONS resilience to fulfill this mandate. While this Climate Change Resilience Strategy will serve as a roadmap for 3.1.6 Promote transparency broad action by the Interagency Council, individual state agencies will also by regularly sharing design and implement their own resilience actions that more specifically information with external address their responsibilities, authorities, and stakeholders. Agency- groups and partners specific action plans will give them not only the opportunity to assess their needs and evaluate regulatory, programmatic, policy, and facilities and infrastructure, but also provide a guiding blueprint for their work moving forward. The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is already undertaking such a review, which could serve as a model for other STATE AGENCIES ON THE agencies. The Interagency Council will seek to develop standard metrics INTERAGENCY COUNCIL or goals for use in all agency plans so that agencies can more easily track statewide progress. In addition to leading the effort to develop this Resilience Strategy, the State Chief Resilience Officer position created by Executive Order 89 has the responsibility of coordinating the DEP’s policies, programs, and activities to plan for and address the current and anticipated impacts of climate change. Other agencies would also benefit from executive support to pursue this work with dedicated resources. Designating an executive level liaison or resilience officer position at each agency would be a meaningful, near-term step to ensure that climate change is adequately prioritized across state government. The steps that any individual agency takes are important not only to bolstering its own resilience to climate change, but also to supporting the entire state government, collectively. State agencies will work cooperatively to actively integrate activities across programs and address conflicts or barriers to promoting resilience. The Interagency Council will be the forum for increased collaboration, oversight, and communication that ensures that state agency efforts all build to the same goals and use standard information when making decisions. Discussions by the Interagency Council have already identified several areas that would benefit from agencies working more closely together. For example, regular data and information sharing through the Interagency Council can help prevent policies from conflicting; building an interagency web portal to share data will aid this effort. A coordinated approach will also provide non-state entities like municipalities and businesses a level of certainty so that they will receive consistent guidance on their activities across multiple agencies. The Interagency Council will strengthen that certainty by providing regular updates and sharing information with the public throughout policy development and implementation. This transparency from state agencies will increase public confidence and participation in New Jersey’s resilience work, both of which are necessary for effective governance.

The Interagency Council will establish processes for regular communication, transparency, and information sharing with other governmental entities. Local, county, and regional governments can help facilitate this by designating a single champion to liaise with the State. By recognizing which entities are best suited to tackle individual aspects of resilience, New Jersey can more efficiently address resilience.

These disproportionate effects must be considered as the state government works to enhance its resilience for all New Jerseyans. State agencies can expand existing efforts to include more specific provisions for equitable involvement of underrepresented groups and their representative community organizations in resilience policymaking and other state agency processes. This deeper involvement will ultimately lead to better solutions to systemic issues. State agencies can also provide direct assistance and funding to projects that wish to engage underserved groups in resilience activities and provide guidance on how to measure the effectiveness of the engagement in those activities. Through the Interagency Council, agencies will work collaboratively to develop guidance to help integrate social vulnerability and environmental justice concerns into resilience planning. Finally, state agencies can create opportunities to evaluate the equity of outcomes for projects and programs that affect or involve underserved populations as they are implemented and afterwards. 47 STRATEGY 3.3 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY“This priority proposes actions that will establish the processes and governance structure necessary to confront climate change as a unified state government.” Trenton, NJPRIORITY 4: INVEST IN INFORMATION AND INCREASE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING 49PRIORITY 4: INVEST IN INFORMATION AND INCREASE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING INTRODUCTION Climate change will affect every resident, business, and resource within New Jersey in some way.

There is not a central repository or dashboard that helps users understand the various agencies and programs that support climate resilience efforts. This information is frequently buried within broader websites, and without knowing exactly which agency and/or program is the correct resource, they can be difficult to navigate. Given the Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) leading role in reducing and responding to climate change, it was the first state agency to create a dedicated webpage to climate change. Over the past year, DEP has updated this webpage to become a central agency clearinghouse of all climate change-related information and links to relevant DEP programs. The DEP will continue to update 51 STRATEGY 4.1 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYPRIORITY 4: INVEST IN INFORMATION AND INCREASE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING this website to address the need for a comprehensive To be effective with such a broad social impact campaign, source of data, tools, guidance, and information related the state will need to utilize partnerships and technology to climate change science and response strategies, but to expand its reach.

At the local level, elected officials and municipal staff explored new and creative opportunities to provide real-time information to residents on new or modified restrictions, as well as information about testing and data on cases. For these reasons, any channel and method that was successful for public communication on the existing health crisis should be considered in development of future information on climate change impacts. Future campaigns may also be modeled on other successful public education and awareness efforts across the nation that have help shaped public understanding of recycling, water use, water quality, and energy use.

STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY STRATEGY 4.1 52PRIORITY 4: INVEST IN INFORMATION AND INCREASE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING Risk Communications Campaign Risk can be perceived very differently by populations that experience similar kinds of events based on culture, economic practices, education, and length of time which they are impacted. As such, it is not enough to relay to people that they are at risk, but it is necessary to help them understand, through compelling and clear messaging, what can be done so they feel empowered to take action. The Coastal Management Program at DEP, with support from NOAA, has partnered with the New Jersey State Council on the Arts and the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JC NERR) to develop and risk communication campaign to provide state and local decision-makers the tools to better communicate the risks and impacts of coastal hazards such as sea-level rise, tidal flooding, and coastal storms. The campaign includes development of risk communication infographics and material that will be used in to engage the public through social media; establishment of the NJ Climate Resilience Public Art Grant Program that will pair community-based organizations and local artists to create art installations throughout the coastal zone; and, will bring NOAA’s “Building Risk Communication Skills” training to local decision-makers to provide new skills, tools, and insights that lead to desired behavior changes The social media campaign and art installations will kick-off in the summer of 2021.

This training effort will include opportunities for change staff at state agencies to also expand knowledge and skills to support implementation of this strategy and continue to advance future actions and programs to enhance climate resilience. In addition to trainings and workshops, community science programs that engage the public in data collection offer an opportunity for residents and others to improve knowledge and skills while providing a critical public service. For example, watershed groups have been utilizing volunteers to collect information about stream quality for years to augment monitoring networks. This data does not replace the need for other monitoring techniques, but it has proven effective at enhancing stewardship. New Jersey could apply this approach to climate change and promote existing or build new community science opportunities to engage the public in observing trends and impacts related to climate change. STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY STRATEGY 4.2 54PRIORITY 4: INVEST IN INFORMATION AND INCREASE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING While public investment in building skills for New Jerseys residents can support volunteer efforts, it can also address workforce development needs. There is a largely untapped opportunity to couple the need to address climate change with post-COVID economic recovery initiatives that increase the physical, economic, and social resilience of the most vulnerable communities in the state. Therefore, a workforce development program may provide resilience benefits to addressing hazards and other climate impacts by supporting infrastructure resilience, for example. This type of program emphasizes the importance of building the resilience of people and local economies, as well as the physical environment they rely on. In addition to workforce development, agencies should promote opportunities to engage youth in developing resilience solutions and pathways for future actions. Recent years have seen a dramatic mobilization of youth action on climate change. Youth-led climate organizations have led demonstrations and called for aggressive state and national action to reduce emissions. This mobilization has been largely associated with the recognition that younger Americans will need to adapt to the world transformed by climate impacts. Climate Change in K-12 Education Scientist Collecting Water Samples New Jersey is the first state in the country to incorporate climate change into its K-12 curriculum standards, taking a first step to prepare students to understand the implications of climate change. In 2019, the Department of Education adopted new standards that integrate climate change not simply through science curriculums, but also into lessons on social studies, health, and world languages. The climate change curriculum will also be presented as an equity issue of global importance. For example, students will grapple with how climate change affects public health and those who are most at-risk. Children in grades 9-12 will explore data for climate change trends and impacts, as well as research and propose engineering and policy solutions to address the challenges. This aggressive effort could serve as a model for other states seeking to increase awareness in youth about how climate change may affect First Lady Tammy Murphy worked with DOE’s Standards their future.

To this end, the NJ Office of Emergency Management is working with Rutgers University to collect high resolution elevation data for coastal floodplains. This new and expansive dataset will provide more accurate information on building elevations, which in turn will significantly improve the state’s ability to understand and estimate risk associated with coastal flood events. Coupled with data on building footprints and the building characteristics available from existing property tax data, the state will be positioned to advance an enhanced risk assessment that will amend the existing state hazard mitigation plan risk assessment and broaden the analysis of climate change. STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY STRATEGY 4.3 56PRIORITY 4: INVEST IN INFORMATION AND INCREASE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING The enhanced risk assessment is just one of the efforts planned by agencies to look at the vulnerability of key state assets, economic drivers, and critical resources to climate change impacts and should be utilized beyond state agencies. Other ongoing and planned agency efforts focus on public health, transportation infrastructure, historic and cultural resources, and ecosystem health and vulnerability. Agencies are continuously evaluating opportunities to analyze the impacts of climate change, in partnership with each other and external organizations. Future assessments should continue to build on existing studies and frameworks to maximize efficiencies. Other potential topics that have been raised as research questions are the role of insurance, reinsurance, and other market forces on adaptation and vulnerability within the state and how supply chains may be impacted by climate change. All future assessments will incorporate advancements in data on climate impacts, as well as improvements to topography, buildings, and infrastructure.

Collectively, these actions will help fill any research gaps and refine the science and data that the state already has. For example, the Scientific Report on Climate Change identified gaps in existing research, two of which were projections for how rainfall patterns are shifting and the impacts to public health in the state. Through a collaborative effort across DEP and the Department of Transportation (DOT), there are two ongoing projects to advance research on precipitation projections and storm events to fill those gaps.

Whether directly climate-related or not, nearly everything the State spends money on will be impacted by climate change. Everything from location and design of public parks and buildings, grantmaking decisions, and utility infrastructure will be affected by climate change. Therefore, state agencies must incorporate climate risk analysis into their asset management, capital funding, and grant programs. In other words, New Jersey must ensure that it is making resilient investments. This can be achieved through multiple pathways, such as updating evaluation, prioritization, and cost-benefit criteria to include a climate lens. That added lens should also include an analysis of the ecological and social impacts 65 STRATEGY 5.1 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYPRIORITY 5: PROMOTE CLIMATE-INFORMED INVESTMENTS AND INNOVATIVE FINANCING “Everything from location and design of public parks and buildings, grantmaking decisions, and utility infrastructure will be affected by climate change.” Paterson Great Falls, NJ of the proposed investment.

In many ways, environmental impact bonds are a blending of Pay for Success contracting with bond investment. Private investors only receive a return on their investment if the project financed by the environmental impact bond is successful in achieving the predetermined outcome, which is evaluated by a third-party based on metrics detailed in the bond agreement. Environmental impact bonds can be structured so that additional financial returns are given if projects outperform expectations. As a result, not only is private capital used to finance public goods, but that capital is also obtained at low cost and low risk; fiscal risk is transferred to the investors. The District of Columbia’s water utility issued the country’s first environmental impact bond in 2016 to finance green infrastructure projects across its service area and provides a robust model for New Jersey. By offering higher returns for better outcomes, environmental impact bonds incentivize efficiency, innovation, and effectiveness. These characteristics make environmental impact bonds a possible mechanism for financing resilience projects in New Jersey.

In addition to community leaders, the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience will work in close collaboration with the Interagency Council on Environmental Justice and the DEP’s Environmental Justice Advisory Council. Through a continuing commitment to equity and justice, state agencies can work to address underlying inequities that lend to disproportionate climate vulnerability, and prioritize the resilience needs of underserved communities in fiscal decision-making, among other areas. Thus, the Interagency Council will actively analyze equity and social vulnerability 69 STRATEGY 5.3 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYPRIORITY 5: PROMOTE CLIMATE-INFORMED INVESTMENTS AND INNOVATIVE FINANCING in decisions on where and how state resilience funding is invested as part of its larger coordination and planning efforts. The Interagency Council recognizes that integrating equity into decision- making may not be enough to support increased resilience in low-income communities. While making New Jersey’s communities more resilient to climate change impacts through home elevations or floodproofing will result in cost savings from avoided losses and decreased insurance premiums, these projects require significant initial capital from home and business owners. Low-income communities may be unable to shoulder such investments, leaving them more vulnerable. To address such inequities, the Interagency Council will explore financial assistance opportunities, including subsidies, for low-income community resilience projects. These public investments will reduce New Jersey’s overall vulnerability to climate impacts, providing net benefits to taxpayers and the state as a whole. The Murphy Administration is committed to equity and transparency in government spending. The Interagency Council will uphold that commitment by publishing resilience funding data online. With publicly available information regarding resilience investments, New Jersey residents can be confident that the State is following through on its commitments to equity and transparency.

While climate change will impact all of New Jersey, the challenges are especially acute in the diverse areas of the coastal zone. In addition to the climate impacts seen statewide, the threats of sea-level rise and increasing coastal storms are making coastal communities more vulnerable, and the response more complex. Over time, how we respond and adapt to climate change will necessarily change the look and feel of New Jersey’s coastal zone, but what will not change, is the coastal zone’s importance to New Jersey’s culture, economy, and character. The Coastal Resilience Plan represents early steps of a long-term strategy for climate change resilience and adaptation.

Management of New Jersey’s coastal zone must include adaptation to the increasing threat of coastal hazards. Donald J. Henderson Memorial Bridge, NJ 79 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYPRIORITY 6: COASTAL RESILIENCE PLADNRAFT Coastal Management The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 authorized the National Coastal Zone Management Program, which is a voluntary partnership between the federal government and U.S. coastal and Great Lakes states and territories. The purpose of the program is to balance the protection of coastal resources with the many competing uses of coastal areas. The Coastal Zone Management Act encourages coastal states to be proactive in managing coastal resources for their benefit and the benefit of the nation. The program is currently administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). New Jersey’s Coastal Management Program received federal approval in 1978. Through the Costal Management Program, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) manages the state’s diverse coastal zone, which encompasses tidal and non-tidal waters, waterfronts, and inland areas.18 To effectively manage the coastal zone, the Coastal Management Program is comprised of a network of offices within the DEP that share responsibility for managing New Jersey’s coastal uses and resources. These activities include wetlands, coastal hazards, public access, marine debris, cumulative and secondary impacts, special area management plans, ocean and Great Lakes resources, energy and government facility siting, aquaculture, and education and outreach. State agencies regulate and influence development, primarily through the DEP, to protect ecosystems and development from harm. The DEP accomplishes this task by bringing together the regulatory authorities of the Coastal Area Facility Review Act, the Wetlands Act of 1970, Waterfront Coastal Goals Maurice River, NJ 1. Healthy coastal ecosystems. 2. Effective management of ocean and estuarine resources. 3. Meaningful public access to and use of tidal waterways and their shores. 4. Sustained and revitalized water-dependent uses. 5. Coastal open space. 6. Safe, healthy and well-planned coastal communities and regions. 7. Coordinated coastal decision-making, comprehensive planning and research. 8. Coordinated public education and outreach. The addition of coastal goals addressing climate change and equity are being considered as part of the New Jersey Protecting Against Climate Threats (PACT) rulemaking process discussed further in Priority 1 and Strategy 6.2. STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY 80PRIORITY 6: COASTAL RESILIENCE PLAN Development Law, Tidelands Act, Public Trust Doctrine, Beaches and Harbors Bond Act, the federal Coastal Zone Management Act, and integrating them through the New Jersey’s Coastal Zone Management Rules to guide implementation of New Jersey’s Coastal Management Program. The collective legislative and executive branch actions between 1970 and 1980 led to the current regulatory framework and action to regulate development and balance economic growth with the protection of environmental resources, public health, and public safety. However, in the face of climate change this balance is threatened by increased pressure of conflicting priorities - protect existing development, enable opportunities for growth, and preserve the critical ecosystems that flourish within New Jersey’s coastal area. The Plan As a means to address these issues, Executive Order 89 directed the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience (Interagency Council) to develop a Coastal Resilience Plan “that recommends a specific long-term strategy for climate change resilience and adaptation in the coastal areas of the State” as part of the broader Climate Change Resilience Strategy. That directive recognizes that nowhere are environmental resources and economic vitality more inextricably linked than in the coastal region and the criticality to plan for the increased risks resulting from climate change. The Coastal Resilience Plan focuses on strategies to protect, restore, and responsibly develop the diverse coastal communities and resources in light of the current and future impacts of climate change. To date, the protection of the coastal zone has been based in part on the 1981 Shore Protection Master Plan. The Coastal Resilience Plan includes the actions necessary to build upon the master plan and outlines the policies, tools, and resources that serve as the initial steps of a statewide effort to increase the resilience of New Jersey’s coastal zone in an equitable, sustainable, and economically viable manner. New Jersey’s coastal area in the future may look and feel different than it does now, but through statewide efforts, this important area can remain an attractive place to live and recreate while continuing to drive the state’s economy. Developed by the Chief Resilience Officer with support from the Interagency Council, this first iteration of the Coastal Resilience Plan focuses on actions state agencies can take to improve the effectiveness, equitability, and sustainability of coastal resilience planning and projects. The Coastal Resilience Plan is a living document that will be updated as coastal resilience science, planning, and actions progress over time and will be the guiding document for how New Jersey manages protection of the coastal zone into the future. Many of the climate change resilience issues facing New Jersey, including Sandy Hook, NJ both climate impacts (temperature rise, air quality changes, etc.) and governance challenges (limited capacity and resources, multiple levels 81 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYPRIORITY 6: COASTAL RESILIENCE PLADNRAFT of government, etc.), are shared by coastal and inland within the Coastal Resilience Plan as needed.

Engineered shore protection projects will not be financially or structurally feasible in every vulnerable area of the coastal zone. The state will prioritize major flood protection investments to large population and economic centers and areas with concentrations of critical infrastructure systems, especially in areas with socially vulnerable populations. 2. The state will continue to invest in all types of coastal resilience strategies to protect and enhance state and community assets but will prioritize non-structural and natural and nature-based features except where technically infeasible. 3. The state will support the development of comprehensive, equitable, resilience plans in every coastal municipality. 4. The state will invest in the protection, restoration, and enhancement of its coastal ecosystems to support their ecological, recreational, and economic value. 5. The State will prepare for and facilitate the evolution of the coastal zone as populations move to safer areas, and limit investments that will hinder that purpose.

This strategy includes actions state agencies will take to empower and incentivize coastal populations in resilience counties and municipalities to build resilience at the local level, regardless planning of capacity, size, location, or wealth. Increasing resilience across all of New Jersey’s communities, not only to the increased risk of flooding but 6.1.5 Integrate resilience into to all climate change impacts, can only be accomplished by significantly State Plan Endorsement increasing capacity at the local level through state government leadership, coastal center designation guidance, and support. As a home rule state, local government action is critical for effective coastal resilience, yet municipalities and counties often lack the technical and financial means to proactively prepare for and confront sea-level rise and other climate impacts. One key action of the Coastal Resilience Plan is development of a resilience plan by every coastal community. These plans should assess exposure to coastal hazards, including future flood events and tidal “nuisance” flooding, and identify resilience responses tailored to the unique character of the community including socially vulnerable populations. The resilience responses identified should include, and prioritize, the use of natural and nature-based features, consistent with other strategies. It is critical that these plans be developed now as most coastal resilience projects take many years to execute and land use planning takes significant time to transition. Local jurisdictions should also consider developing post-disaster plans and policies to ensure 83 STRATEGY 6.1 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYPRIORITY 6: COASTAL RESILIENCE PLADNRAFT that they “bounce forward” and not simply “build back” after an event. Furthermore, a recently enacted amendment to the Municipal Land Use Law requires a climate change-related hazard vulnerability assessment be included in municipal master plan updates. All of these plans must ensure the engagement of socially vulnerable populations during development and seek to specifically address identified needs in order to foster equitable community resilience and prevent additional inequality. To support development of local resilience plans, existing planning programs should be expanded to provide additional resources and technical assistance. Several initiatives are currently underway that will provide some of the guidance and resources municipalities require to adequately address the critical need to plan and prepare for worsening climate change impacts. The DEP will expand its Resilient NJ program to provide additional support to local governments including local resilience planning guidance that addresses sea-level rise, funding opportunities, and the actions local governments can take to improve resilience. This expansion will include direct technical assistance provided through the New Jersey’s Coastal Management Program’s 2021-2025 Section 309 Assessment and Strategy for coastal hazards, which will develop a Regional Resilience Coordinator initiative. Additionally, the Office of Planning Advocacy will support municipal planning through the Plan “One key action of Endorsement program, which has already incorporated requirements for the Coastal Resilience resilience planning, climate mitigation, and equity as part of the updated Plan is development Plan Endorsement Guidelines (October 2020). of a resilience plan Regardless of the technical assistance and guidance provided by state by every coastal agencies, municipalities will require funding assistance to develop and community.” implement local plans. New Jersey should consider providing a steady source of funding for a standing grant program to allow local jurisdictions Perth Amboy, NJ to significantly advance their resilience planning. New Jersey Fostering Regional Adaptation Through Municipal Economic Scenarios (NJ FRAMES) The NJ FRAMES project, also known as “Two Rivers, One Future,” is a collaborative regional effort for the fifteen municipalities around the Navesink and Shrewsbury Rivers in coastal Monmouth County, New Jersey. The region partnered with the Coastal Management Program through DEP and NOAA, Rutgers University, and the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JC NERR) to better understand and begin to address the future flood vulnerability in their communities. The project used comprehensive, regional planning to develop a regional action plan that addresses the challenges associated with climate adaptation for the communities on the frontlines of rising sea levels and increasing frequency of coastal storms and flooding. This was accomplished through comprehensive community and stakeholder engagement, regional risk and cost-benefit assessments, scenario planning, government coordination, and cutting-edge practices to plan for the long-term impacts of climate change. The planning framework piloted in NJ FRAMES was developed by NOAA and informed development of DEP’s Resilient NJ program.

For example, sea-level rise risk zones should be identified for areas that will be chronically inundated and require risk assessments to assure the resilient of development in these highly vulnerable locations. Additionally, state agencies should ensure that regulatory requirements for risk reduction measures do not inadvertently incentivize development in highly vulnerable locations. For example, development is prohibited on beaches. However, due to loophole in the definition of a beach, construction of an engineered dune provides an area landward of that dune where development would now be permitted. These are critical steps to protect New Jerseyans and the economy by ensuring that coastal communities are resilient.

Without a marsh or forest buffer, back bay communities would be impacted by daily wave energy and increasingly battered by storm surge. One study found that communities located behind intact marshes had 20 percent less flood damage than those communities in which the marsh buffer had been lost.24 These damage reduction benefits equal large financial savings for New Jersey residents.

A regional sediment management plan is also identified as a need in Strategy 6.4. New Jersey should also undertake efforts that allow tidal wetlands to migrate landward as a means to adapt to sea-level rise. It will be critical to keep coastal upland areas adjacent to tidal marshes free from impediments, such as bulkheads, roads, and other hard structures, to allow marsh migration. A 2014 Rutgers University study showed that nearly 2,000 acres of New Jersey’s tidal marshes could be impeded from migrating at one foot of sea-level rise. This estimate is likely to increase by 2050 if coastal development and shoreline hardening continue at the current pace.30 While marsh migration is influenced by many factors, immediate New Jersey’s focus should be on development of an inventory to identify coastal upland ecosystems with the potential as future marsh migration corridors, Coastal Habitat leveraging programs like the Blue Acres Program to remove development from flood prone areas and develop and adopt best management practices to successfully facilitate marsh migration. For example, the DEP and 90% of New Jersey’s the DOT should partner to determine where undersized bridges and coastline is protected culverts need to be replaced, and where bridges and culverts could be installed, to allow tidal flow to support areas where roads block marsh from exposure to migration.

The initiative aims to advance techniques for the beneficial use of dredged material through research, collaboration, and practical application. The Seven Mile Island Innovation Laboratory builds upon several successful marsh and avian habitat enhancement projects in past years. Building on a rich historic dataset from these previous projects, new demonstration projects will help develop a more systematic, science-based approach to dredging and habitat restoration. This concept is based on a Dutch “Living Lab for Mud” initiative to test and demonstrate environmental benefits. Seven Mile Island, located in Cape May County, is a barrier island backed by approximately 24 square miles of tidal marsh, coastal lagoons, tidal channels, and bay that is vulnerable to sea-level rise and is showing signs of degradation. The area was chosen for the Innovation Lab because of its diversity – including existing and historic dredged material placement sites, confined disposal facilities, federal and state channels including the New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway, extensive tidal marshes, and a mixture of sandy and muddy sediments. The marsh provides critical habitat for birds, fish, shellfish, and other wildlife and provides protection from sea-level rise and storm surge for the barrier island communities of Avalon and Stone Harbor. The Seven Mile Island Innovation Laboratory Working Group was established representing natural resource managers, scientists, engineers, practitioners, communication specialists, and regulators from government, academia, and non- profit organizations to collaborate on an effective restoration design. USACE is collecting sediment and hydrodynamic data and The Wetlands Institute is collecting avian site usage and vegetation. The data is being used to develop initial project designs and placement strategies, with a goal of completing a project by 2021.

Additionally, research has found that hard stabilization features do not offer as much protection from high storm surges as once thought. For example, after Hurricane Irene made landfall in 2011 in North Carolina, three quarters of bulkheads were damaged while none of the natural marsh shorelines were impaired.31 While the natural marshes saw an immediate impact to vegetation, these areas did not sustain a loss of sediment or elevation, and the vegetation recovered within the year.

However, they also noted that it is still easier to replace bulkheads in-kind due to permitting requirements and the experience and knowledge of contractors. State and federal agencies should continue to work together to further streamline application and review procedures to promote natural and nature-based features. The DEP could also provide guidance for property owners and contractors to determine the type of natural or nature-based feature that would be most appropriate for their shoreline by linking permit decisions to a statewide assessment and mapping effort that identifies appropriate stabilization measures based on specific shoreline conditions, the criticality of upland Mordecai Island development, and other consideration.

The beach and dune systems are the first line of defense against ocean waves and storm surge for vulnerable residences, businesses, infrastructure, and habitats not only located on the barrier island but on the mainland as well. New Jersey’s beach and dune systems protect billions of dollars of coastal development and the multi-billion-dollar tourism and coastal recreational industries that rely on beaches and back bays for recreation and intact ecosystems. Beaches and dunes are some of New Jersey’s most valuable natural resources, yet most of them sustain repetitive erosion from coastal storms and often do not receive sand replenishment for years at a time. These impacts are only expected to increase due to sea-level rise and the increased intensity of coastal storms,32 putting the communities, economy, and ecosystems at greater risk to flooding. After Hurricane Sandy, the United States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) estimated that beach and dune restoration projects in New York and New Jersey saved $1.3 billion in avoided damages.33 In New Jersey, the restoration and maintenance of beaches is a shared effort between the state, federal, and local governments, and to a lesser extent, non- governmental organizations, but is administered by the DEP with monies from the Shore Protection Fund.

Since 2018, almost the entire annual appropriation from the Shore Protection Fund has been allocated to the DEP’s cost-share for USACE projects.

The DEP will mechanisms also prioritize ecological projects, and restoration and preservation funds, through a Coastal Ecological Restoration and Adaptation Plan that is currently under development with funding from EPA. This effort builds on work funded by NOAA through the Coastal Management Program to create a methodology to prioritize opportunities for preservation, restoration, and enhancement of natural resources within the coastal zone. A stable funding source would be beneficial for DEP to implement ecologically based projects prioritized through this process. Currently, Shore Protection Funds are utilized largely for implementation of USACE coastal storm damage reduction projects. The authority to use and implement these funds should be updated to allow DEP the ability to implement non-structural and nature-based resilience strategies in efforts to protect shorelines. This plan will not recommend any specific funding methods, but there must be recognition that the cost of climate change impacts, especially sea-level rise and more intense storms, will continue to increase into the future. The average annual hurricane-related loss from wind and flooding in New Jersey today is anticipated to be between $670 million to $1.3 billion higher than it was in 1980 due to sea-level rise.1 This increase in cost is only expected to continue as sea-level rise worsens and hurricane and other storm impacts expand farther inland. For New Jersey to equitably increase coastal resilience, additional funding streams and mechanisms are needed. Potential options include bonding, taxes, fees, or innovative alternatives such as resilience and environmental impact bonds, property assessment resilience funding, tax sharing, special improvement districts, or a regional resilience trust fund, some of which are addressed in more detail in Priority 5.

The DEP, Climate and Flood Resilience Program, makes decisions and recommendations regarding the allocation of funds for projects along the New Jersey coast. To improve that process, the Decision Support System presents environmental, economic, and social data that must be considered for efficient and effective risk management with limited resources in a changing coastal environment. The data will provide DEP with the rationale for funding allocations. The Decision Support System utilizes existing internal and external data from various state and federal resources within a geographic information system platform to facilitate the comprehensive assessment of the costs and benefits of proposed projects. Through the lens of risk assessment, mitigation costs and full societal project benefits, the Decision Support System includes a geoprocessing tool to provide environmental, economic, and social values relevant to address near- future risks and highlight challenges that threaten the vitality and productivity of the state. The Decision Support System is designed to provide information to facilitate evaluation of existing and anticipated DEP coastal storm flood strategies and projects, which include, but are not limited to, bulkhead replacement, jetty repair, beach replenishment, dune hardening, and ecosystem restoration. As part of this effort, a database of past and current shore protection projects is being created to better identify how each project can integrate into a regional and statewide coastal resilience approach. 110033 STRATEGY 6.7 SSTTAATTEE OOFF NNEEWW JJEERRSSEEYY CCLLIIMMAATTEE CCHHAANNGGEE RREESSIILLIIEENNCCEE SSTTRRAATTEEGGYYPRIORITY 6: COASTAL RESILIENCE PLADNRAFT STRATEGY 6.8: Share Financial Responsibility for Resilience ACTIONS 6.8.1 Require local commitment to long-term operation and maintenance of resilience projects 6.8.2 Update state-local cost shares requirements to be more equitable 6.8.3 Encourage private property owners to adapt to sea-level rise Meadowlands, NJ 6.8.4 Encourage local and As climate change increases flooding and erosion in coastal areas, New county commitment to Jersey increasingly faces the need for new coastal resilience plans and finance local resilience projects, including upgrades to existing flood risk reduction infrastructure. projects Current funding sources are not able to keep pace with the demands of climate change.

As previously noted, the $25 million annual budget of the Shore Protection Fund is the only guaranteed funding for shore protection projects and is largely allocated for the state to cover the non-federal cost-share responsibility for USACE coastal storm damage reduction projects, limiting the DEP’s ability to support additional projects. Local governments can actively participate in reducing flood risk through implementation of local projects and participation in federally funded projects. The Interagency Council should encourage local and county governments to pursue local flood risk reduction projects through partnerships with the USACE or other funding sources. Policies should also be updated to make it easier for local participation in federal projects.

Sea-level rise projections suggest that such government efforts would be needed in more areas in the future, making them more costly, and eventually unviable in certain areas. As such, it will be increasingly difficult for people to live and work in coastal places as sea-level rise inundation increases in magnitude and extent. As far back as the 1981 Shore Protection Master Plan there was a noted need for programs to encourage relocation out of coastal hazard areas after destructive storms and post-storm acquisition of portions of barrier islands. New Jersey created the Blue Acres Program in 1995 to help move people out of harm’s way and protect communities from flooding by providing open space as flood buffers. The Blue Acres program is a nationally recognized success story and is on its way to buying out 1,000 flood prone properties since Hurricane Sandy. New Jersey should build on “State agencies should take additional steps to identify the regulatory and policy reforms needed to prepare for and facilitate the evolution of the coastal zone.” Cape May, NJ 107 STRATEGY 6.9 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYPRIORITY 6: COASTAL RESILIENCE PLADNRAFT the success of the Blue Acres Program seeking to expand the program and implement additional homeowner support measures. Even with existing annual appropriations, fiscal limitations prevent the buyout of all homes from interested property owners living within flood-prone areas. This strategy proposes that the Interagency Council work with the legislature and federal partners to find new and larger pots of money to deal with the anticipated influx of buyout demand. While the Blue Acres Program offers relocation assistance, homeowners are not required to participate, so New Jersey is not able to track where every seller chooses to move. Some sellers have taken a buyout only to relocate to another vulnerable area, putting themselves at risk and perpetuating the need and expectation of a government buyout in the future. If the demand for buyout and relocation assistance programs increase to a point where current acquisition programs are unsustainable, reforms should be explored including adding seller relocation contingencies to future buyout contracts, only allowing one buyout per property owner over a lifetime, and precluding buyout of any newly constructed homes in inundation areas. Blue Acres Blue Acres Property, Linden, NJ As of 2019, the Blue Acres Program has received dedicated annually funding from the Corporate Business Tax Act (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) to acquire property in tidal and non-tidal flood prone areas. The program also leverages federal funding from the HUD and FEMA. Since Hurricane Sandy, Blue Acres has secured funding for 1,185 properties and made offers on 1,114 properties in 20 municipalities across ten counties. As of February 2021, 827 homeowners have accepted buyout offers, with 755 having closed. More than 697 homes have been demolished and removed from these purchased properties, increasing flood mitigation and further protecting inland communities. Much of this interest has occurred in riverine areas. As sea-levels continue to rise, this demand will expand into new areas. The Blue Acres Program seeks to expand capacity where possible to meet the needs of communities. Early on in the program, it became evident that a number of property owners who were interested in a buyout could not move forward because of being “underwater” on mortgages. To help these owners move to safer ground, the program created a team to negotiate with mortgage lenders. Since Sandy, the program has negotiated $5.7 million in debt forgiveness on behalf of homeowners. Another successful homeowner support activity, the tenant relocation program provides relocation assistance to displaced tenants who reside in properties that will be acquired by the Blue Acres Program to help these tenants make an efficient and smooth transition to replacement housing. Every measure is taken to ensure the replacement housing is decent, quality housing, and is not located in a repetitive flooding area by 1) inspecting the property to make sure it meets HUD’s housing quality standard and 2) verifying through FEMA mapping that the property is outside a vulnerable area. Tenants receive a list of decent and safe comparable housing outside the repetitive flooding areas, a relocation benefit, and advisory services, if needed, provided by third party agencies. Since 2016, 45 households have relocated and $1.23 million in relocation benefits have been expended. The Blue Acres Program is currently exploring the potential for partnerships with housing relocation experts from within buyout communities who could support property owners’ efforts to move to higher ground within the existing community. As the program continues to work with communities and address the unique needs and impacts affecting each community, it will continue to expand its capacity to meet the needs of New Jersey’s communities.

STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY 110next steps Jersey City, NJSTATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY New Jersey has been experiencing the impacts of a changing climate and will continue to do so over the coming decades, affecting all aspects of the state’s environment, communities, and economy. As directed by Governor Philip D. Murphy’s Executive Order 89, the priorities presented in this first iteration of New Jersey’s Climate Change Resilience Strategy establish the basis for policy and action planning at all levels of government. The continued development of the Resilience Strategy, with broad public participation in that process, will determine how well the state adapts to a changing future. Progressing from the planning of strategies to their implementation via specific actions will be an iterative process which begins now. State agencies, individually and with the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience, will review programs and policies based on the information presented here and in the Scientific Report on Climate Change. Agencies will assess their procedures to determine how the actions presented in the Resilience Strategy can be applied to their operations and programs. The Department of Environmental Protection, for example, will put forth a comprehensive Climate Action Plan by the end of 2021, which will describe the steps it will take to begin integrating climate considerations into its programs. “Climate change during the state’s planning horizon from today to 2100 will affect all aspects of New Jersey’s environment, communities, and economy. The continued development of the Climate Change Resilience Strategy, with broad participation in that process, will determine how well the state adapts to a changing future.” The agencies of the Interagency Council will engage stakeholders when assessing potential operational, policy, and programmatic changes needed to implement the Resilience Strategy. Stakeholders will also have the opportunity to provide new ideas that will refine future planning and implementation of the Resilience Strategy. The Interagency Council will ensure that all stakeholders, including residents and those that are not part of traditional stakeholder groups, are aware of and able to provide feedback on the actions that should be taken for a climate-resilient state. As the inaugural edition of this effort, the Resilience Strategy does not represent all of the work that New Jersey will undertake over time to build the state’s resilience to climate change. Future editions will include more specific, detailed actions which advance those included here. Through NEXT STEPS 112NEXT STEPS subsequent editions of the Resilience Strategy, the Interagency Council will report to the public its successes, its challenges, and the actions needed to resolve those challenges. The Interagency Council recognizes the policy and operational changes, and new initiatives that will be needed to accomplish the priorities described throughout this document will all require personnel and financial resources. Understanding the amount of funding needed to implement these actions will require more detailed analysis as specific programs are modified and developed. Thus, the Resilience Strategy does not include cost estimates or funding plans for the included actions. The Interagency Council will work with the Governor’s Office and Legislature to develop a path forward which will allow equitable implementation of this Strategy. Interagency Council on Climate Resilience Paulus Hook Next Steps All of the actions presented in the Climate Change Resilience Strategy are vital to confronting New Jersey’s climate impacts. However, many of these actions will require a significant amount of time and planning before they can be fully implemented. There are many initiatives currently underway that are parallel to the actions presented here. These include guidance for municipalities to use in resilience planning, the Resilient NJ regional planning program, Economic Recovery Act programs, NJ PACT regulatory modernization, and ongoing education and outreach efforts across the state. Together, these workstreams form the basis for future work of the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience. The following list includes immediate next steps for the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience to take in the next six to twelve months to accelerate the implementation of the Climate Change Resilience Strategy: • Develop a work plan for Interagency Council on Climate Resilience, including issue-specific working groups • Coordinate the work of the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience with the Environmental Justice Interagency Council • Develop agency climate change action plans • Schedule meetings with local government officials groups • Conduct broad outreach and engagement with stakeholders and the public The priorities, strategies, and actions presented in this Climate Change Resilience Strategy are the framework around which future discussions will take place. The Interagency Council looks forward to working with New Jerseyans to confront the challenges of building resilience to climate change. 113 NEXT STEPS STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGYNEXT STEPS “The priorities, strategies, and actions presented in this Climate Change Resilience Strategy are the framework around which future discussions will take place.

        "October 12, 2021 Fellow New Jerseyans, Climate change is the single greatest long-term threat currently facing humanity, and our state and economy are uniquely vulnerable to its devastating effects. The science of climate change is clear. As detailed in the New Jersey Scientific Report on Climate Change released by our administration last year, temperatures are increasing, sea levels are rising, and severe storms are becoming more frequent and intense. As the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida made painfully clear in September 2021, New Jersey's climate change risks are already manifesting across the state. These risks will only worsen in the years to come, with potentially devastating impacts to our communities, economy, public health, and the daily lives of our residents. The circumstances demand that we act with concerted urgency to promote and secure a more climate resilient future for New Jersey. Building climate resilience requires decisive and intentional action across all sectors and levels of government. Executive Order No. 89 (Oct. 29, 2019) jumpstarted this action, resulting in this inaugural statewide Climate Change Resilience Strategy, an iterative planning tool that will be continually updated in the years ahead. The Strategy outlines more than one hundred actions across six primary areas - recommendations that are intended to guide our institutions in building programs and policies that promote climate resilience. This Strategy is but a first step in a years-long effort to aid New Jersey communities and institutions in adapting to the realities of climate change. This inaugural edition could not and does not prescribe the detailed legislative, regulatory, and policy changes that must be developed through further public discourse. The Strategy establishes a baseline, suggests a prioritization of key public policy concerns, and presents a framework for continuous progress. Importantly, the Strategy acknowledges that climate change will not impact all New Jerseyans equally. The state's more vulnerable communities are already facing disproportionate climate risks and are likely to face greater adverse outcomes if equity and justice are not prominent and consistent features of the state's adaptation efforts. To that end, the Strategy places climate justice squarely at its center. Finally, we must note that this Strategy and the actions that must follow would not be possible without the dedicated staff of the Department of Environmental Protection's Bureau of Climate Resilience Planning and the thoughtful collaboration of representatives from across the seventeen state agencies that comprise New Jersey's lnteragency Council on Climate Resilience. Over the last two years, and amidst a global pandemic that has only solidified our commitment to preparedness, our administration assembled to develop this framework for ensuring New Jersey's resilience to climate change. Together with the emissions reductions proposed in the 2020 Global Warming Response Act 80x50 Report and the 2019 Energy Master Plan, the Strategy will further support our great state in responding to climate change through measures that protect our communities and environment, grow our economy, and lift all of our people. Together, we will meet this critical moment. Philip D. Murphy Shawn M. LaTourette Governor Commissioner of Environmental Protection Jane E.

Climate change poses an immediate and severe threat to the environment, human health and welfare, security, and the economy—in New Jersey, across the United States, and around the world. Rising sea- levels, increasing temperatures, more frequent and intense storms, and chronic flooding are among the noticeable changes that communities already experience. Furthermore, these impacts compound other challenges, such as, infrastructure conditions, inequality, and public health. Unfortunately, climate impacts and their secondary effects will worsen in the years ahead, even with aggressive emissions reductions due to the greenhouse gases that will remain in the atmosphere Current greenhouse gas mitigation initiatives are imperative to minimizing the long-term threats of a changing climate, but they are insufficient to protect New Jersey from climate change. Combatting climate change requires both aggressive actions to curb emissions, while simultaneously building resilience into the natural and built environments. Recognizing that New Jersey’s vulnerability to climate change cannot wait and requires coordinated leadership, Governor Phil Murphy signed Executive Order 89 establishing the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience in October 2019. This Interagency Council brings together seventeen agencies with responsibilities for maintaining the physical, environmental, and economic health of New Jersey’s precious resources and communities. The executive order also created the position of the Chief Resilience Officer for New Jersey and charged this position with delivering the state’s first Climate Change Resilience Strategy and Coastal Resilience Plan, with support from the Interagency Council. Enhancing the resilience of New Jersey’s communities, ecosystems, infrastructure, and economy requires an all-hands on deck approach to governing; the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience will lead this effort. “Climate change is the single greatest long-term threat currently facing humanity and effectively combatting it will require a whole of government approach” – Governor Phil Murphy This inaugural Resilience Strategy outlines the broad policy framework under which the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience’s work will occur. The scale of action needed to address climate impacts is unprecedented, and this Resilience Strategy is only the first step. Confronting climate change will require efficiency in the use of capital, maximizing co-benefits at every opportunity, and innovative solutions to ensure that New Jersey’s communities, landscapes, and economy are designed for the future, and not the past. Climate change will permeate every EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2",

        "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1 PRIORITY 1: BUILD RESILIENT AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES A resilient New Jersey starts with strong, vibrant, and healthy communities. Nearly 9 million people call New Jersey home, making it the densest and one of the most diverse states in the country. The landscapes from the highlands to the sandy beaches of the barrier islands are as diverse as their people, cultures and history. Climate change will continue to place stress on these vibrant places and their residents, and fostering community resilience will require planning, innovation, decisive action, collaboration, and an unwavering commitment to sound, science-based decision-making. Key Outcomes • A statewide technical assistance program to support local climate resilience actions • Increased integration of climate change into local, regional, and state planning • Expanded support for workforce development and capacity-building across all levels of government • Focused resources and policies to address inequities in underserved communities 2 PRIORITY 2: STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF NEW JERSEY’S ECOSYSTEMS New Jersey is rich with beautiful mountains, lakes, rivers, and beaches that are the delight of its residents and tourists alike. The farms, forests, bays, and other ecosystems in New Jersey are vital to the state’s economy and identity as the Garden State. They also provide critical habitat to more than 3,700 wildlife species, from monarch butterflies to blue whales. With ecosystem services ranging from water filtration to flood attenuation to recreation, New Jersey residents rely on their natural environment for clean air and water regardless of where they live or work. These incalculable benefits afforded by the state’s healthy ecosystems are at risk from the impacts of climate change. Protecting our natural systems, minimizing environmental threats, and restoring degraded areas are critical to protecting the health and vitality of all natural resources in the state, as well as the benefits they provide to residents. Key Outcomes • Healthier ecosystems that are more resilient to climate change impacts • Enhancement of ecosystem services to benefit overall state resilience, including water storage and filtration, flood attenuation, carbon sequestration, and urban heat mitigation • Natural resources, agriculture, and public lands better positioned to adapt to environmental changes 5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY",
        "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PRIORITY 3: PROMOTE COORDINATED 3 GOVERNANCE Climate change impacts will affect every aspect of state and local government, just as they will every sector of New Jersey’s economy, and every resident. State agencies need to consider climate change as part of business as usual for everything the government does. By viewing the operations of government through a climate resilience lens, New Jersey will be able to confront the coming impacts in a proactive manner. The Interagency Council on Climate Resilience brings these perspectives together to create a coordinated approach to addressing climate resilience. Key Outcomes • Efficient, proactive, communicative governance of statewide climate resilience policy through the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience • High level engagement and accountability across state agencies • Inclusion of local government and community leaders and their expertise in state resilience decisions PRIORITY 4: INVEST IN INFORMATION 4 AND INCREASE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING Climate change is the defining issue of our time. As a threat multiplier it will permeate every sector, resource, and community with wide- reaching implications. Increasing resilience to these impacts requires preparedness, and awareness is a key part of being prepared. It is critical that the state is using the best available information for its own decision-making and proactively sharing that information with residents, businesses, and other stakeholders. Key Outcomes • A multi-faceted public education and risk communication campaign • Improved data and methods for understanding climate resilience • Increased engagement from the public, business community, and all levels of government STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 6",
        "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5 PRIORITY 5: PROMOTE CLIMATE-INFORMED INVESTMENTS AND INNOVATIVE FINANCING The scale of action needed to address climate impacts is unprecedented, requiring extraordinary efficiency in capital deployment and the opportunity to maximize co-benefits with every dollar. Both public and private funds will be essential to funding resilience actions throughout the state. Given the significant risks that climate change poses for current investments of public funds, climate risk assessment and avoidance becomes vital. It is important that the State prioritizes investment of public dollars into activities that serve the long-term economic needs and boost the resilience of communities, especially those that are least able to respond. Key Outcomes • Integrate climate considerations and fiscal risk from climate change impacts into funding criteria • Prioritization of socially vulnerable populations in funding decisions • Expanded use of private capital and innovative financing mechanisms to fund resilience 6 PRIORITY 6: COASTAL RESILIENCE PLAN The coastal areas of New Jersey provide infinite value as places of residence, tourist destinations, cultural and historic assets, ecological resources, and economic drivers within the state. While climate change will impact every area in the state, nowhere are the challenges more acute than the diverse communities of the coastal zone. Responding to the threats of sea-level rise, changes in coastal storms, and other climate impacts will inevitably change the look and feel of communities up and down the coast. Transforming state coastal management, increasing nature-based resilience measures, and encouraging proactive planning for sea-level rise and increased storm risk are the central goals of the state’s first Coastal Resilience Plan. Key Outcomes • An expanded tidal wetland monitoring program • Resilience incorporated into design of new development and redevelopment projects • Prioritization of state funding for coastal resilience projects to protect major population and economic centers, concentrations of critical infrastructure, and socially vulnerable populations • More private property owners adapting to climate change • Assessment of relocation policy opportunities and obstacles 7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY",

Some populations are more adversely affected factors of social vulnerability: socioeconomic status, age, by climate change due to pre-existing factors like age or gender, race and ethnicity, English language proficiency, ability; and for some populations, unequal impacts are and disability. Here, underserved populations refer to any also a result of historic and systematic inequities.

Others populations of concern often face both climate and non- may face greater health risks from heat waves or lower climate related stressors that contribute to underlying air quality because of age, race, or pre-existing health community inequities. These stressors might include conditions, such as asthma, or where they live. As social unequal access to health and economic resources, limited vulnerability inherently poses challenges to resilience social cohesion, high crime or violence, or disproportionate and adaptation, this strategy aims to respond to climate exposure to environmental hazards. Since environmental, threats and foster community resilience in an equitable socioeconomic and health inequities are inextricably and inclusive manner to prevent worsening existing connected, climate change’s devastating impacts on the inequality. physical environment can in turn create other negative impacts for socially vulnerable populations.

The Centers could experience increased economic vulnerability as heat waves become more frequent and too hot to work, resulting in lost wages. For socially vulnerable “BIPOC communities have been populations, underlying societal inequities and challenges subjected to living in segregated create the biggest hurdles to achieving resilience, and neighborhoods with more pollution, state agencies must consider and evaluate these issues as they create more opportunities for resilience. older infrastructure, and greater exposure to climate hazards, as well Research also points to the disproportionate impact that as lower income status, less economic climate change especially has on BIPOC communities mobility, and less access to quality and in the United States.ii This is often due to historic affordable healthcare.” discriminatory housing, environmental and investment policies, and exclusion from planning processes, among other factors. As a result, BIPOC communities have been subjected to living in segregated neighborhoods with more pollution, older infrastructure, and greater exposure to climate hazards, as well as lower income status, less economic mobility, and less access to quality and affordable healthcare. These pre-existing conditions make it more difficult for some BIPOC communities to adapt to climate change, and in fact can be exacerbated 9 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY",

A strategy to create a resilient New Jersey requires in areas classified as addressing the needs and challenges of all New Jerseyans. “overburdened.” New Jersey’s approach to enhancing equity through climate resilience is three-fold. First, ensure climate change and resilience planning includes and is responsive to the entire community. State resilience planning efforts should be transparent, accessible, and responsive. Second, direct resources to build capacity in lower-resourced communities and foster local planning and resilience efforts driven by community leaders. Third, monitor resource distribution and outcomes to ensure that the state sees appropriate reductions in risk and measurable increases in resilience within all communities across the state. Across all six priorities in this strategy, state agencies are committed to improving resilience for those communities that face the steepest challenges in addressing the risks of climate change. Environmental Justice and Climate Change In 2018, Governor Murphy issued Executive Order 23, which recognizes the historic and ongoing disproportionate exposure to various environmental burdens faced by many of New Jersey’s low-income communities and BIPOC communities. The order directs the executive branch to ensure that the principles of environmental justice (EJ) are at the core of state policies and programs. To guide State decisions and the integration of EJ into executive agencies’ core functions, the Department of Environmental Protection issued “Furthering the Promise: A Guidance Document for Advancing Environmental Justice Across State Government.” The document provides a path forward for agencies to apply principles for furthering the promise of EJ in New Jersey, as identified by impacted communities and decades of local, state, and federal experience. In 2020, the state legislature strengthened the state’s commitment to addressing environmental justice through the passage of a law mandating the Department of Environmental Protection evaluate the environmental and public health impacts of certain facilities on overburdened communities when reviewing certain permit applications. Signed by Governor Murphy in September 2020, this landmark legislation will help curb pollution and cumulative and secondary impacts for the approximately 4.5 million individuals living in areas classified as “overburdened” by the legislation, and around the state. i Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2015.

There are other rules, policies, or existing statutes that may need to be revised to respond to the harmful impacts of climate change. For example, the authority for the state’s oversight of the Uniform Construction Code does not allow for consideration of future conditions. The current building code was adopted in 2019 and is based on the International Building Code/2018. The DCA has identified future updates that incorporate climate resilience as a necessary next step but does not have the authority to modify it as often or in ways necessary to respond to climate change.

In New Jersey, there are no statutory or regulatory requirements for real estate disclosures from the seller. While the state courts have ruled that sellers must provide knowledge of material defects, the requirements related to current or future hazards are unclear. In contrast, many states have disclosure forms that provide critical information to the buyer, including flooding history and insurance obligations. Currently, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma have the strongest real estate disclosure laws in the country.4 Disclosure requirements might include improving access to elevation certificates, substantial damage determination letters, and/or requiring flood zone disclosure and documentation of past flooding. These actions would allow potential buyers to fully evaluate monthly mortgage costs and weigh the disaster recovery costs prior to making an offer on a property. Enacting disclosure laws would further resilience by encouraging the seller take mitigation actions before the sale or informing the buyer of the costs to bring the house into regulatory compliance. Other Interagency Council actions will work to improve compliance with existing regulations, as well as track regulatory programs to monitor effectiveness, and continue to encourage municipalities to exceed federal minimum standards provided by the NFIP.

The NJEDA actively participates on the Interagency Taskforce on Offshore Wind and recently introduced the “Offshore Wind Technical Assistance Program” to support local companies in the development of the skills and competencies necessary to participate in the Offshore Wind industry. In addition to creating jobs through new innovative sectors, the NJEDA is committed to investing in community revitalization through its Brownfields Loan Program. This program provides financing to potential brownfield site purchasers and current brownfield sites that intend to develop commercial, such as manufacturing or retail, mixed-use developments, expansions or reuses.

Social determinants of health include living and working conditions, education, income, neighborhood characteristic, social inclusion, and medical care. These social constructs have continually experienced inequitable public investment and harmful public policies that are linked to current inequality metrics.

        "PRIORIDTYR 2A: SFTTRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF NEW JERSEY’S ECOSYSTEMS DRAFT INTRODUCTION Not only are New Jersey’s ecosystems central to its identity as the Garden State and quality of life, but they are also enjoyed and treasured by citizens and visitors alike. To be resilient, New Jersey must ensure that its ecosystems are resilient. The health of an ecosystem directly affects the health and well-being of New Jersey residents who live and work near them and the economies that rely on those ecosystems. If water quality is poor, for example, ecological, human, and economic systems suffer. The Interagency Council recognizes that a wholistic approach to climate resilience must strengthen the resilience of our ecosystems. As a priority, strengthening ecosystems serves as a resilience strategy in two ways. First, by supporting the health and diversity of ecosystems, they continue Tree frog in the Pine Barrens to provide valuable services as the climate changes. These ecosystem services are an important tool for building resilience. With ecosystem services ranging from water filtration and flood attenuation to food production and carbon sequestration, New Jersey residents rely on their natural environment for clean air and water regardless of where they live or work. Though their intrinsic value is priceless, the value of ecosystems goes far beyond aesthetics and recreation. In financial terms, the annual value of ecosystem services in New Jersey was estimated to be $8-19 billion,1 many of which will lessen the impacts of climate change. Second, nature-based interventions can be less expensive alternatives to hazard mitigation or hard engineering measures, while providing additional value and services. For example, some the most valuable and cost-effective of those mitigation services come from wetlands, which also provide vital habitat and opportunities for recreation.2 Beaver Habitat at the Plainsboro Preserve “The health of an ecosystem directly affects the health and well-being of New Jersey residents who live and work near them and the economies that rely on those ecosystems.” STRATEGIES: 2.1 Promote Resource Conservation and Natural Lands Management to Strengthen Ecological Resilience 2.2 Manage Agricultural Lands, Forests, and Other Ecosystems for Climate Impacts and Environmental Stressors 2.3 Deploy Natural and Nature-based Solutions for Resilience STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY 32",

State parks, nature preserves, degraded ecosystems to rivers, and open space are often thought of as perfectly preserved areas enhance their ability to set aside for the enjoyment of their visitors. Though idyllic, this surface- perform resilience-related level view of natural lands and resources does not recognize the values services and services these areas provide or the vulnerabilities they face. The warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns projected due to 2.1.4 Provide habitat climate change will result in these special places looking and functioning connectivity and corridors differently, which can impact water quality and supply, flood protection, to support wildlife and air quality in adjacent communities. The ability of ecosystems to adapt adaptation to changing to changing conditions is thus important to the state’s overall resilience to conditions climate change. If forests in a public space are unable to adapt to a changing climate, for example, the surrounding community may face locally higher temperatures and diminished air quality. As a threat multiplier, climate change will exacerbate the impacts of existing stressors such as pollution, fragmentation, and invasive species, threatening the ability of nature to serve its critical functions. Protecting our natural systems and restoring degraded landscapes ensures the existence of our cherished natural areas, but also serves to safeguard our communities from the impacts of climate change by using the power of nature itself. Importantly, protecting these resources also helps reduce the greenhouse gas pollution that drives climate change. Through this strategy, the State will use its conservation efforts to strengthen ecological resilience and use ecosystem services to address climate threats. Although not initially created with climate change in mind, several existing land management and preservation programs help promote resilience. For example, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) administers the Green Acres Program to protect open space as well as natural, historic, and cultural areas for public use and enjoyment. By creating a system 33 STRATEGY 2.1 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY",
        "PRIORIDTYR 2A: SFTTRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF NEW JERSEY’S ECOSYSTEMS DRAFT of interconnected open spaces, the Green Acres Program preserves and enhances New Jersey’s natural environment, and in turn, its resilience to climate change. Together with public and private partners, the Green Acres Program has protected over 500,000 acres of open space around New Jersey. Due to fiscal constraints, there are often more potential properties to protect than funds to protect them. Conservation programs use a variety of factors to prioritize where to spend their limited resources; some statutory, some policy. During that prioritization process, future climatic conditions should be taken into consideration. These large contiguous preserved lands will support wildlife as it begins to move to more suitable areas. The DEP has begun to plan for facilitation of that movement through its Connecting Habitat Across New Jersey (CHANJ) program. CHANJ is an effort to make landscapes around the state more permeable to wildlife by identifying key areas and actions to achieve habitat connectivity. Riverine connectivity is equally important for promoting healthy species populations. Removing antiquated dams, where appropriate, can improve ecological conditions while also increasing flood resilience in nearby communities. By using the best-available science in programs such as CHANJ to inform preservation and conservation decisions, state agencies can help ensure that investments in nature will be best targeted and protected from loss. Setting aside pristine lands and waters is not the only ecological approach to resilience in which the Interagency Council sees value. Restoring degraded resources to their natural status is also a useful tool for building resilience to climate change. Degraded areas that have been negatively impacted by pollution or hazards have diminished value for our communities and our resilience. The DEP’s Office of Natural Resource Restoration works to restore and enhance damaged resources, which expands ecosystem services and revives ecosystem health to the benefit of local communities. Restoration is not limited to contaminated sites. For example, the DEP’s Blue Acres program has restored a floodplain ecosystem in Linden, Union County in an area where it acquired frequently flooded properties through its floodplain buyout acquisitions.

Capturing the synergies between ecological restoration and community resilience is thus a powerful strategy for New Jersey. Nantuxent Wildlife Management Area Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) In October 2019, the DEP announced $13.5 million dollars in funding to implement innovative projects and technologies to mitigate and prevent harmful algal blooms (HABs) in lakes and public waters throughout New Jersey.3 Naturally occurring in lakes and ponds, the algae-like bacteria that causes these blooms can proliferate to unsafe, levels and produce toxins under certain conditions, including warm weather, high-nutrient, stagnant waters, and sunshine. Climate change is expected to exacerbate the problem of HABs, resulting in an acute public health threat from drinking and recreating in affected waterways. Ecosystems, wildlife, pets, and livestock can also be negatively impacted. In turn, businesses that rely on the use of New Jersey’s waterways are also impacted. The State’s investment to protect waters that are vulnerable to harmful algal blooms in turn boosts the resilience of those waters and communities that rely on them.

The approach to building resilience to the threat of wildfire is twofold: understand the risk and conduct preventative management. To that end, the NJ Forest Fire Service (Service) is developing a Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal (WRAP) to provide a standard tool for quantifying and interpreting wildfire hazard and risk statewide. With the information from WRAP, the Service can target preventative management in at-risk areas.

        "PRIORITY 2: STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF NEW JERSEY’S ECOSYSTEMS Pervious pavement, landscaping, and bioswale areas captures stormwater runoff. Green Infrastructure in Stormwater Rules Stormwater runoff is a major source of water pollution throughout New Jersey and across the nation. Every day, runoff from storms carries fertilizers, pesticides, automotive fluids and other pollutants into waterways, degrading ecosystems and impairing lakes, streams, and rivers. Poorly controlled stormwater also exacerbates dangerous flooding conditions, and the increase in projected rainfall and extreme weather due to climate change creates added risk for harm to people and property from stormwater runoff. In March 2020, DEP formally adopted amendments to the state’s stormwater management rules to better protect water quality by reducing polluted runoff through use of green infrastructure technologies. The amendments include a requirement for permit applicants to use green infrastructure, rather than more traditional engineered structures, to reduce stormwater runoff and achieve water quality goals. Green Infrastructure is typically used to refer to methods to manage stormwater through approaches that mimic natural hydrologic processes in developed areas. This approach more naturally manages stormwater, allowing better infiltration of above-ground stormwater into the ground water deeper beneath our feet. This infiltration process is simple and nature-based: it uses vegetation and soil to naturally filter out pollutants. Green infrastructure can also include ways to store some stormwater runoff for later beneficial reuse, such as irrigation. In addition to protecting and better managing stormwater, these approaches beautify communities and help in the fight against climate change by creating carbon-sequestering green space. Creating these green spaces also mitigates the heat-island effect caused by development and pavement, which can raise average temperatures in urban areas relative to less developed areas. 3399 STRATEGY 2.3 SSTTAATTEE OOFF NNEEWW JJEERRSSEEYY CCLLIIMMAATTEE CCHHAANNGGEE RREESSIILLIIEENNCCEE SSTTRRAATTEEGGYY",

        "PRIORITY 3: PROMOTE COORDINATED GOVERNANCE INTRODUCTION Climate change impacts will touch every aspect of state and local government, just as they will affect every sector of New Jersey’s economy, and every citizen of the state. In practice, this means that the State must come together to enhance resilience to climate change impacts. Without a concerted effort to address climate change impacts, the state government would risk being unprepared, disorganized, or with inconsistent and conflicting approaches to complicated problems. Executive Order 89 mandates that the Executive Branch “shall take proactive and coordinated efforts”i to promote resilience; a whole-of-government approach to climate resilience that is necessary and required. State agencies build on the foundation of Executive Order 89 by expanding opportunities for collaborative governance. Therefore, state agencies must integrate climate change into all practices, making it business as usual and not a supplementary consideration. By viewing the operations of government through a climate resilience lens, the state government will be able to confront the coming impacts in a proactive manner. This priority proposes actions that will establish the processes and governance structure necessary to confront climate change as a unified state government.

In addition to leading the effort to develop this Resilience Strategy, the State Chief Resilience Officer position created by Executive Order 89 has the responsibility of coordinating the DEP’s policies, programs, and activities to plan for and address the current and anticipated impacts of climate change. Other agencies would also benefit from executive support to pursue this work with dedicated resources. Designating an executive level liaison or resilience officer position at each agency would be a meaningful, near-term step to ensure that climate change is adequately prioritized across state government. The steps that any individual agency takes are important not only to bolstering its own resilience to climate change, but also to supporting the entire state government, collectively. State agencies will work cooperatively to actively integrate activities across programs and address conflicts or barriers to promoting resilience. The Interagency Council will be the forum for increased collaboration, oversight, and communication that ensures that state agency efforts all build to the same goals and use standard information when making decisions. Discussions by the Interagency Council have already identified several areas that would benefit from agencies working more closely together. For example, regular data and information sharing through the Interagency Council can help prevent policies from conflicting; building an interagency web portal to share data will aid this effort. A coordinated approach will also provide non-state entities like municipalities and businesses a level of certainty so that they will receive consistent guidance on their activities across multiple agencies. The Interagency Council will strengthen that certainty by providing regular updates and sharing information with the public throughout policy development and implementation. This transparency from state agencies will increase public confidence and participation in New Jersey’s resilience work, both of which are necessary for effective governance.

This training effort will include opportunities for change staff at state agencies to also expand knowledge and skills to support implementation of this strategy and continue to advance future actions and programs to enhance climate resilience. In addition to trainings and workshops, community science programs that engage the public in data collection offer an opportunity for residents and others to improve knowledge and skills while providing a critical public service. For example, watershed groups have been utilizing volunteers to collect information about stream quality for years to augment monitoring networks. This data does not replace the need for other monitoring techniques, but it has proven effective at enhancing stewardship.

There is a largely untapped opportunity to couple the need to address climate change with post-COVID economic recovery initiatives that increase the physical, economic, and social resilience of the most vulnerable communities in the state. Therefore, a workforce development program may provide resilience benefits to addressing hazards and other climate impacts by supporting infrastructure resilience, for example. This type of program emphasizes the importance of building the resilience of people and local economies, as well as the physical environment they rely on. In addition to workforce development, agencies should promote opportunities to engage youth in developing resilience solutions and pathways for future actions. Recent years have seen a dramatic mobilization of youth action on climate change. Youth-led climate organizations have led demonstrations and called for aggressive state and national action to reduce emissions. This mobilization has been largely associated with the recognition that younger Americans will need to adapt to the world transformed by climate impacts. Climate Change in K-12 Education Scientist Collecting Water Samples New Jersey is the first state in the country to incorporate climate change into its K-12 curriculum standards, taking a first step to prepare students to understand the implications of climate change. In 2019, the Department of Education adopted new standards that integrate climate change not simply through science curriculums, but also into lessons on social studies, health, and world languages. The climate change curriculum will also be presented as an equity issue of global importance. For example, students will grapple with how climate change affects public health and those who are most at-risk. Children in grades 9-12 will explore data for climate change trends and impacts, as well as research and propose engineering and policy solutions to address the challenges. This aggressive effort could serve as a model for other states seeking to increase awareness in youth about how climate change may affect First Lady Tammy Murphy worked with DOE’s Standards their future.

        "PRIORITY 6: COASTAL RESILIENCE PLADNRAFT Coastal Management The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 authorized the National Coastal Zone Management Program, which is a voluntary partnership between the federal government and U.S. coastal and Great Lakes states and territories. The purpose of the program is to balance the protection of coastal resources with the many competing uses of coastal areas. The Coastal Zone Management Act encourages coastal states to be proactive in managing coastal resources for their benefit and the benefit of the nation. The program is currently administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). New Jersey’s Coastal Management Program received federal approval in 1978. Through the Costal Management Program, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) manages the state’s diverse coastal zone, which encompasses tidal and non-tidal waters, waterfronts, and inland areas.18 To effectively manage the coastal zone, the Coastal Management Program is comprised of a network of offices within the DEP that share responsibility for managing New Jersey’s coastal uses and resources. These activities include wetlands, coastal hazards, public access, marine debris, cumulative and secondary impacts, special area management plans, ocean and Great Lakes resources, energy and government facility siting, aquaculture, and education and outreach. State agencies regulate and influence development, primarily through the DEP, to protect ecosystems and development from harm. The DEP accomplishes this task by bringing together the regulatory authorities of the Coastal Area Facility Review Act, the Wetlands Act of 1970, Waterfront Coastal Goals Maurice River, NJ 1.

The collective legislative and executive branch actions between 1970 and 1980 led to the current regulatory framework and action to regulate development and balance economic growth with the protection of environmental resources, public health, and public safety. However, in the face of climate change this balance is threatened by increased pressure of conflicting priorities - protect existing development, enable opportunities for growth, and preserve the critical ecosystems that flourish within New Jersey’s coastal area. The Plan As a means to address these issues, Executive Order 89 directed the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience (Interagency Council) to develop a Coastal Resilience Plan “that recommends a specific long-term strategy for climate change resilience and adaptation in the coastal areas of the State” as part of the broader Climate Change Resilience Strategy. That directive recognizes that nowhere are environmental resources and economic vitality more inextricably linked than in the coastal region and the criticality to plan for the increased risks resulting from climate change. The Coastal Resilience Plan focuses on strategies to protect, restore, and responsibly develop the diverse coastal communities and resources in light of the current and future impacts of climate change. To date, the protection of the coastal zone has been based in part on the 1981 Shore Protection Master Plan. The Coastal Resilience Plan includes the actions necessary to build upon the master plan and outlines the policies, tools, and resources that serve as the initial steps of a statewide effort to increase the resilience of New Jersey’s coastal zone in an equitable, sustainable, and economically viable manner. New Jersey’s coastal area in the future may look and feel different than it does now, but through statewide efforts, this important area can remain an attractive place to live and recreate while continuing to drive the state’s economy. Developed by the Chief Resilience Officer with support from the Interagency Council, this first iteration of the Coastal Resilience Plan focuses on actions state agencies can take to improve the effectiveness, equitability, and sustainability of coastal resilience planning and projects. The Coastal Resilience Plan is a living document that will be updated as coastal resilience science, planning, and actions progress over time and will be the guiding document for how New Jersey manages protection of the coastal zone into the future.

The state will prioritize major flood protection investments to large population and economic centers and areas with concentrations of critical infrastructure systems, especially in areas with socially vulnerable populations. 2. The state will continue to invest in all types of coastal resilience strategies to protect and enhance state and community assets but will prioritize non-structural and natural and nature-based features except where technically infeasible. 3. The state will support the development of comprehensive, equitable, resilience plans in every coastal municipality. 4. The state will invest in the protection, restoration, and enhancement of its coastal ecosystems to support their ecological, recreational, and economic value. 5.

As a home rule state, local government action is critical for effective coastal resilience, yet municipalities and counties often lack the technical and financial means to proactively prepare for and confront sea-level rise and other climate impacts. One key action of the Coastal Resilience Plan is development of a resilience plan by every coastal community. These plans should assess exposure to coastal hazards, including future flood events and tidal “nuisance” flooding, and identify resilience responses tailored to the unique character of the community including socially vulnerable populations. The resilience responses identified should include, and prioritize, the use of natural and nature-based features, consistent with other strategies. It is critical that these plans be developed now as most coastal resilience projects take many years to execute and land use planning takes significant time to transition.

Furthermore, a recently enacted amendment to the Municipal Land Use Law requires a climate change-related hazard vulnerability assessment be included in municipal master plan updates. All of these plans must ensure the engagement of socially vulnerable populations during development and seek to specifically address identified needs in order to foster equitable community resilience and prevent additional inequality. To support development of local resilience plans, existing planning programs should be expanded to provide additional resources and technical assistance. Several initiatives are currently underway that will provide some of the guidance and resources municipalities require to adequately address the critical need to plan and prepare for worsening climate change impacts. The DEP will expand its Resilient NJ program to provide additional support to local governments including local resilience planning guidance that addresses sea-level rise, funding opportunities, and the actions local governments can take to improve resilience. This expansion will include direct technical assistance provided through the New Jersey’s Coastal Management Program’s 2021-2025 Section 309 Assessment and Strategy for coastal hazards, which will develop a Regional Resilience Coordinator initiative.

The initiative aims to advance techniques for the beneficial use of dredged material through research, collaboration, and practical application. The Seven Mile Island Innovation Laboratory builds upon several successful marsh and avian habitat enhancement projects in past years. Building on a rich historic dataset from these previous projects, new demonstration projects will help develop a more systematic, science-based approach to dredging and habitat restoration. This concept is based on a Dutch “Living Lab for Mud” initiative to test and demonstrate environmental benefits. Seven Mile Island, located in Cape May County, is a barrier island backed by approximately 24 square miles of tidal marsh, coastal lagoons, tidal channels, and bay that is vulnerable to sea-level rise and is showing signs of degradation. The area was chosen for the Innovation Lab because of its diversity – including existing and historic dredged material placement sites, confined disposal facilities, federal and state channels including the New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway, extensive tidal marshes, and a mixture of sandy and muddy sediments. The marsh provides critical habitat for birds, fish, shellfish, and other wildlife and provides protection from sea-level rise and storm surge for the barrier island communities of Avalon and Stone Harbor. The Seven Mile Island Innovation Laboratory Working Group was established representing natural resource managers, scientists, engineers, practitioners, communication specialists, and regulators from government, academia, and non- profit organizations to collaborate on an effective restoration design. USACE is collecting sediment and hydrodynamic data and The Wetlands Institute is collecting avian site usage and vegetation. The data is being used to develop initial project designs and placement strategies, with a goal of completing a project by 2021.

Coastal stakeholders may disagree about the implementation of managed retreat as a resilience strategy, but sea-level rise will ultimately make it a necessary consideration. Many of the actions included throughout the Coastal Resilience Plan are interim actions to ensure that later decisions are less costly and disruptive.

Sea-level rise projections suggest that such government efforts would be needed in more areas in the future, making them more costly, and eventually unviable in certain areas. As such, it will be increasingly difficult for people to live and work in coastal places as sea-level rise inundation increases in magnitude and extent. As far back as the 1981 Shore Protection Master Plan there was a noted need for programs to encourage relocation out of coastal hazard areas after destructive storms and post-storm acquisition of portions of barrier islands. New Jersey created the Blue Acres Program in 1995 to help move people out of harm’s way and protect communities from flooding by providing open space as flood buffers. The Blue Acres program is a nationally recognized success story and is on its way to buying out 1,000 flood prone properties since Hurricane Sandy. New Jersey should build on “State agencies should take additional steps to identify the regulatory and policy reforms needed to prepare for and facilitate the evolution of the coastal zone.” Cape May, NJ 107 STRATEGY 6.9 STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY",
        "PRIORITY 6: COASTAL RESILIENCE PLADNRAFT the success of the Blue Acres Program seeking to expand the program and implement additional homeowner support measures. Even with existing annual appropriations, fiscal limitations prevent the buyout of all homes from interested property owners living within flood-prone areas. This strategy proposes that the Interagency Council work with the legislature and federal partners to find new and larger pots of money to deal with the anticipated influx of buyout demand. While the Blue Acres Program offers relocation assistance, homeowners are not required to participate, so New Jersey is not able to track where every seller chooses to move. Some sellers have taken a buyout only to relocate to another vulnerable area, putting themselves at risk and perpetuating the need and expectation of a government buyout in the future. If the demand for buyout and relocation assistance programs increase to a point where current acquisition programs are unsustainable, reforms should be explored including adding seller relocation contingencies to future buyout contracts, only allowing one buyout per property owner over a lifetime, and precluding buyout of any newly constructed homes in inundation areas. Blue Acres Blue Acres Property, Linden, NJ As of 2019, the Blue Acres Program has received dedicated annually funding from the Corporate Business Tax Act (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) to acquire property in tidal and non-tidal flood prone areas. The program also leverages federal funding from the HUD and FEMA. Since Hurricane Sandy, Blue Acres has secured funding for 1,185 properties and made offers on 1,114 properties in 20 municipalities across ten counties. As of February 2021, 827 homeowners have accepted buyout offers, with 755 having closed. More than 697 homes have been demolished and removed from these purchased properties, increasing flood mitigation and further protecting inland communities. Much of this interest has occurred in riverine areas. As sea-levels continue to rise, this demand will expand into new areas. The Blue Acres Program seeks to expand capacity where possible to meet the needs of communities. Early on in the program, it became evident that a number of property owners who were interested in a buyout could not move forward because of being “underwater” on mortgages. To help these owners move to safer ground, the program created a team to negotiate with mortgage lenders. Since Sandy, the program has negotiated $5.7 million in debt forgiveness on behalf of homeowners. Another successful homeowner support activity, the tenant relocation program provides relocation assistance to displaced tenants who reside in properties that will be acquired by the Blue Acres Program to help these tenants make an efficient and smooth transition to replacement housing. Every measure is taken to ensure the replacement housing is decent, quality housing, and is not located in a repetitive flooding area by 1) inspecting the property to make sure it meets HUD’s housing quality standard and 2) verifying through FEMA mapping that the property is outside a vulnerable area. Tenants receive a list of decent and safe comparable housing outside the repetitive flooding areas, a relocation benefit, and advisory services, if needed, provided by third party agencies. Since 2016, 45 households have relocated and $1.23 million in relocation benefits have been expended. The Blue Acres Program is currently exploring the potential for partnerships with housing relocation experts from within buyout communities who could support property owners’ efforts to move to higher ground within the existing community. As the program continues to work with communities and address the unique needs and impacts affecting each community, it will continue to expand its capacity to meet the needs of New Jersey’s communities.

        "STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY New Jersey has been experiencing the impacts of a changing climate and will continue to do so over the coming decades, affecting all aspects of the state’s environment, communities, and economy. As directed by Governor Philip D. Murphy’s Executive Order 89, the priorities presented in this first iteration of New Jersey’s Climate Change Resilience Strategy establish the basis for policy and action planning at all levels of government. The continued development of the Resilience Strategy, with broad public participation in that process, will determine how well the state adapts to a changing future. Progressing from the planning of strategies to their implementation via specific actions will be an iterative process which begins now. State agencies, individually and with the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience, will review programs and policies based on the information presented here and in the Scientific Report on Climate Change. Agencies will assess their procedures to determine how the actions presented in the Resilience Strategy can be applied to their operations and programs. The Department of Environmental Protection, for example, will put forth a comprehensive Climate Action Plan by the end of 2021, which will describe the steps it will take to begin integrating climate considerations into its programs. “Climate change during the state’s planning horizon from today to 2100 will affect all aspects of New Jersey’s environment, communities, and economy. The continued development of the Climate Change Resilience Strategy, with broad participation in that process, will determine how well the state adapts to a changing future.” The agencies of the Interagency Council will engage stakeholders when assessing potential operational, policy, and programmatic changes needed to implement the Resilience Strategy. Stakeholders will also have the opportunity to provide new ideas that will refine future planning and implementation of the Resilience Strategy. The Interagency Council will ensure that all stakeholders, including residents and those that are not part of traditional stakeholder groups, are aware of and able to provide feedback on the actions that should be taken for a climate-resilient state. As the inaugural edition of this effort, the Resilience Strategy does not represent all of the work that New Jersey will undertake over time to build the state’s resilience to climate change. Future editions will include more specific, detailed actions which advance those included here. Through NEXT STEPS 112",
        "NEXT STEPS subsequent editions of the Resilience Strategy, the Interagency Council will report to the public its successes, its challenges, and the actions needed to resolve those challenges. The Interagency Council recognizes the policy and operational changes, and new initiatives that will be needed to accomplish the priorities described throughout this document will all require personnel and financial resources. Understanding the amount of funding needed to implement these actions will require more detailed analysis as specific programs are modified and developed. Thus, the Resilience Strategy does not include cost estimates or funding plans for the included actions. The Interagency Council will work with the Governor’s Office and Legislature to develop a path forward which will allow equitable implementation of this Strategy. Interagency Council on Climate Resilience Paulus Hook Next Steps All of the actions presented in the Climate Change Resilience Strategy are vital to confronting New Jersey’s climate impacts. However, many of these actions will require a significant amount of time and planning before they can be fully implemented. There are many initiatives currently underway that are parallel to the actions presented here. These include guidance for municipalities to use in resilience planning, the Resilient NJ regional planning program, Economic Recovery Act programs, NJ PACT regulatory modernization, and ongoing education and outreach efforts across the state. Together, these workstreams form the basis for future work of the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience. The following list includes immediate next steps for the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience to take in the next six to twelve months to accelerate the implementation of the Climate Change Resilience Strategy: • Develop a work plan for Interagency Council on Climate Resilience, including issue-specific working groups • Coordinate the work of the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience with the Environmental Justice Interagency Council • Develop agency climate change action plans • Schedule meetings with local government officials groups • Conduct broad outreach and engagement with stakeholders and the public The priorities, strategies, and actions presented in this Climate Change Resilience Strategy are the framework around which future discussions will take place. The Interagency Council looks forward to working with New Jerseyans to confront the challenges of building resilience to climate change. 113 NEXT STEPS STATE OF NEW JERSEY CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY",
