Climate Ready Boston evaluates stormwater fl ooding at the 10-year, 24-hour frequency event, though more and less severe and frequent events are known to occur.

It does not evaluate more severe events, like the 100- year, 24-hour storm events. 14 City of Boston: Climate Ready Boston Climate Vulnerability Assessment 15EXPOSURE, VULNERABILITY, CONSEQUENCES, AND RISK Exposure signifi es people, buildings, infrastructure, and other resources (assets) that are within areas that are most likely to experience hazard impacts. Nevertheless, exposure analysis does not provide insight into the extent or severity of exposure or even whether the people, buildings, or infrastructure will experience loss, as it does not consider site specifi c conditions (e.g., building fl ood-proofi ng) that may prevent or limit impacts. Vulnerability refers to how and why people or assets could be affected by a hazard or how and why the effects could be exacerbated or limited. Assessing vulnerabilities requires site- specifi c or demographic information, such as CONNECTING CLIMATE PROJECTIONS TO THE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT’S HAZARD ANALYSIS existing fl ood-proofi ng measures or whether people have vehicles that could facilitate evacuation. Consequence analysis illustrates to what extent people or assets can be expected to be affected by a hazard, as a result of combined vulnerability and exposure. Consequences are qualitative and quantitative impacts to exposed and Climate Factors for Climate vulnerable people, buildings, or infrastructure, and many can be communicated in terms Projection Consensus of economic losses. Categories of loss quantifi ed for this analysis include direct physical damages to buildings (including structure, contents, and inventory damage), human impacts or stress factors (mental stress, anxiety, and lost productivity), displacement costs (the cost to relocate a business or household as a result of fl ood impacts), and losses to the city’s economy due to business interruption. The consequence analysis Climate Hazards from also evaluates shelter needs expected as a result of a coastal fl ood event, but these Vulnerability Assessment consequences are not separately monetized. Risk is essentially the combination of exposure, vulnerability, and consequences. Risk is often defi ned as the product of both the probability and consequences of an impact and is expressed in this report as annualized losses. GEOGRAPHIC VARIABILITY OF HAZARDS and businesses that reside in the area, the entry in the Exposure and Consequence Analysis for point along the waterfront leading to fl ooding, Focus Areas, which were selected for additional Two climate hazards—extreme heat and variation in topography, and the coastal or riverine assessment at a more granular level due the robust stormwater fl ooding—generally pose similar conditions defi ning the fl ood hazard (e.g., the nature of the information available, quality of threats citywide; thus, the challenges and basic duration of fl ooding). evaluation possible at that scale, and magnitude of principles of many preparedness eff orts related to expected consequences throughout this century. heat and stormwater hazards remain largely the Level of detail also varies spatially (e.g., The Roxbury neighborhood has been selected as same across neighborhoods.

CITYWIDE LAND ACRES EXPOSED Landmarks nearest the coast, like the Institute for Contemporary Art, the New England Aquarium, and Boston Children’s Museum, lie in some of the most exposed parts of the city. Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market are slightly farther inland but without additional actions are also at risk of fl ooding during future high tides. Many of the city’s oldest landmarks, such as the Old State House, Paul Revere House, and Old North Church, sit on higher ground, above fl ood risk. Why are many of the Boston’s oldest landmarks out of the projected fl oodplains? The relative safety of these older landmarks refl ects the history of our city: transformed through centuries of landfi ll, the original islands and peninsula of the city remain higher and more protected than areas built on fi lled tidelands. Comparison of Boston’s original landforms to the 1 percent annual chance fl oodplain late in the century shows a close parallel; large portions of the original landforms in Charlestown, the North End, Downtown, East Boston, and South Boston remain out of the coastal fl oodplain even late in the century while areas that were fi lled over time are at higher risk of fl ooding from coastal storms. However, some fi lled areas, like parts of Columbia Point, were fi lled to higher elevations and therefore face less exposure to future fl ooding. The impacts of climate change are not only isolated to coastal storms. By late in the PEOPLE considered more dangerous, as it is more likely century, the most noticeable changes to our current landscape will likely be seen during CITYWIDE POPULATION EXPOSED to result in massive property damage and injury In the late century, 75 percent of high tides, which will creep higher and higher and can require years for full recovery.

Combined, the top four economic industries in Boston expected to be aff ected by business interruption account for over 50 percent of the expected business interruption impacts for the city (averaged across all sea level rise conditions). Business interruption also impacts jobs in Boston, as a reduction in sales and revenues, as well as temporary business closure, may ultimately reduce the number of jobs required to support the economy. The restaurant and retail industries lead with the most jobs impacted for each sea level rise condition, accounting for 80, 48, and 52 percent of the total annual jobs expected to be lost for early-, mid-, and late-century impacts, respectively.

A full explanation of the limitations associated with this assessment can be found in the Appendix. • Short- and long-term impacts to the local and federal government that follow a fl ood event, such as dispensing additional public aid and mobilizing emergency management crews, are not refl ected in the d amage costs. Such costs are based on a variety of factors (including the scale and magnitude of the event, as well as the built and natural environment and population contexts) and are extremely diffi cult to predict. • Businesses located above the second fl oor of a multistory building are not considered in this analysis, even though those businesses may also experience closures or damage (such as mold accumulation) if power and water are not operating in the building. Further, code compliance actions that may be triggered by repairs (such as electrical and fi re suppression systems) can run through the entirety of a building, depending on the specifi cs of the structure, further increasing restoration costs; such costs are not considered in this analysis. • Impacts to the economy assume all businesses will eventually reopen, yet in reality almost 40 percent of all small businesses never reopen following a CITYWIDE ANNUALIZED LOSSES disaster.83 • Impacts to supporting economic industries and spending patterns are only acknowledged within the context of Suffolk County.

In actuality, the entire building will often experience business direct output losses, which are sales and revenues interruption (though no reliable resource exists to consistently calculate business interruption impacts to an entire structure), many fl ooded businesses may not ever lost by businesses that must close or relocate while reopen after being directly fl ooded, and economic impacts could extend nationally or internationally, depending upon industries affected. As such, these results are considered the minimum business interruption consequences of a regional fl ood event.

        "EXPOSURE, VULNERABILITY, CONSEQUENCES, AND RISK Exposure signifi es people, buildings, infrastructure, and other resources (assets) that are within areas that are most likely to experience hazard impacts. Nevertheless, exposure analysis does not provide insight into the extent or severity of exposure or even whether the people, buildings, or infrastructure will experience loss, as it does not consider site specifi c conditions (e.g., building fl ood-proofi ng) that may prevent or limit impacts. Vulnerability refers to how and why people or assets could be affected by a hazard or how and why the effects could be exacerbated or limited. Assessing vulnerabilities requires site- specifi c or demographic information, such as CONNECTING CLIMATE PROJECTIONS TO THE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT’S HAZARD ANALYSIS existing fl ood-proofi ng measures or whether people have vehicles that could facilitate evacuation. Consequence analysis illustrates to what extent people or assets can be expected to be affected by a hazard, as a result of combined vulnerability and exposure. Consequences are qualitative and quantitative impacts to exposed and Climate Factors for Climate vulnerable people, buildings, or infrastructure, and many can be communicated in terms Projection Consensus of economic losses. Categories of loss quantifi ed for this analysis include direct physical damages to buildings (including structure, contents, and inventory damage), human impacts or stress factors (mental stress, anxiety, and lost productivity), displacement costs (the cost to relocate a business or household as a result of fl ood impacts), and losses to the city’s economy due to business interruption. The consequence analysis Climate Hazards from also evaluates shelter needs expected as a result of a coastal fl ood event, but these Vulnerability Assessment consequences are not separately monetized. Risk is essentially the combination of exposure, vulnerability, and consequences. Risk is often defi ned as the product of both the probability and consequences of an impact and is expressed in this report as annualized losses.

        "BACK TO THE FUTURE? CITYWIDE LAND ACRES EXPOSED Landmarks nearest the coast, like the Institute for Contemporary Art, the New England Aquarium, and Boston Children’s Museum, lie in some of the most exposed parts of the city. Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market are slightly farther inland but without additional actions are also at risk of fl ooding during future high tides. Many of the city’s oldest landmarks, such as the Old State House, Paul Revere House, and Old North Church, sit on higher ground, above fl ood risk. Why are many of the Boston’s oldest landmarks out of the projected fl oodplains? The relative safety of these older landmarks refl ects the history of our city: transformed through centuries of landfi ll, the original islands and peninsula of the city remain higher and more protected than areas built on fi lled tidelands. Comparison of Boston’s original landforms to the 1 percent annual chance fl oodplain late in the century shows a close parallel; large portions of the original landforms in Charlestown, the North End, Downtown, East Boston, and South Boston remain out of the coastal fl oodplain even late in the century while areas that were fi lled over time are at higher risk of fl ooding from coastal storms. However, some fi lled areas, like parts of Columbia Point, were fi lled to higher elevations and therefore face less exposure to future fl ooding.

        "ECONOMY EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS OF COASTAL FLOODING For all sea level rise conditions, restaurants, real estate, retail and wholesale trade, and transportation industries are consistently the most affected by business interruption due to coastal and riverine fl ooding. Combined, the top four economic industries in Boston expected to be aff ected by business interruption account for over 50 percent of the expected business interruption impacts for the city (averaged across all sea level rise conditions). Business interruption also impacts jobs in Boston, as a reduction in sales and revenues, as well as temporary business closure, may ultimately reduce the number of jobs required to support the economy. The restaurant and retail industries lead with the most jobs impacted for each sea level rise condition, accounting for 80, 48, and 52 percent of the total annual jobs expected to be lost for early-, mid-, and late-century impacts, respectively.

A full explanation of the limitations associated with this assessment can be found in the Appendix. • Short- and long-term impacts to the local and federal government that follow a fl ood event, such as dispensing additional public aid and mobilizing emergency management crews, are not refl ected in the d amage costs. Such costs are based on a variety of factors (including the scale and magnitude of the event, as well as the built and natural environment and population contexts) and are extremely diffi cult to predict. • Businesses located above the second fl oor of a multistory building are not considered in this analysis, even though those businesses may also experience closures or damage (such as mold accumulation) if power and water are not operating in the building. Further, code compliance actions that may be triggered by repairs (such as electrical and fi re suppression systems) can run through the entirety of a building, depending on the specifi cs of the structure, further increasing restoration costs; such costs are not considered in this analysis. • Impacts to the economy assume all businesses will eventually reopen, yet in reality almost 40 percent of all small businesses never reopen following a CITYWIDE ANNUALIZED LOSSES disaster.83 • Impacts to supporting economic industries and spending patterns are only acknowledged within the context of Suffolk County. Boston has broader economic relationships, which would increase the reverberation of impacts to the regional and broader economy. • Calculations consider zero growth or change from Business interruption is expected to they repair fl ood-damaged structures or restock the present-day population and built environment. total nearly $250 million in annualized inventory.

In actuality, the entire building will often experience business direct output losses, which are sales and revenues interruption (though no reliable resource exists to consistently calculate business interruption impacts to an entire structure), many fl ooded businesses may not ever lost by businesses that must close or relocate while reopen after being directly fl ooded, and economic impacts could extend nationally or internationally, depending upon industries affected. As such, these results are considered the minimum business interruption consequences of a regional fl ood event.
