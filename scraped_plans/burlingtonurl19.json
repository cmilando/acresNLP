Rising seas and changes to the coastline are the most dramatic evidence of climate change, but it is impacting every facet of Cape Cod’s natural, built, and community systems. By the end of the century, damage to Cape Cod’s buildings and land lost to inundation could alone total over $30 billion. Our land use patterns and way of living dictate our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the leading cause of the climate crisis. Dedicated and immediate action is necessary to slow the effects of climate change and improve the region’s resiliency to its impacts. The Cape Cod Climate Action Plan provides a framework for action to support a climate resilient region.CAPE COD CLIMATE ACTION PLAN ExECUTivE SUmmARY The Climate Action Plan was developed Generation Roadmap for Climate Policy several principles that shaped the approach during a time of increasing concern about established a State-wide net zero carbon to identifying and prioritizing solutions.

The Plan is the result of an intensive in carbon emissions by 2030. The target of for the long-held regional goals that have effort by the Cape Cod community to address “net zero” emissions is defined as “a level of shaped Cape Cod’s growth policies and a regional challenge of such significance statewide greenhouse gas emissions that is planning decisions in recent decades, as well that 79% of the region’s residents believe equal in quantity to the amount of carbon as the considered and deliberate nature of it will impact their family’s well-being.

Emissions were modeled from the transportation, building, and electricity sectors from 2021 through 2050 for five scenarios, including one sustained policy scenario that assumes current policies EMISSIONS meet their intended goals , and four decarbonization scenarios which propose different paths for emissions reductions.

Cape Cod Commission staff compiled strategies, actions, and steps through a literature review of climate action plans from around the country; from the Pathways to Net Zero developed by the Cape Cod Climate Change Collaborative; from additional research; and through an PRIORITIZING iterative process of refinement with stakeholders. ACTION The following mitigation and adaptation strategies emerged to broadly characterize the areas where the region should focus its climate action efforts, including those that target the region’s highest emitting sectors: ixCAPE COD CLIMATE ACTION PLAN ExECUTivE SUmmARY An economic analysis completed as part of the planning process helped to prioritize strategies and outlines considerations for implementation. The strategies and actions identified through the Climate Action Plan process require the region to come together to implement. Partnerships within government, and with and between non- governmental organizations, researchers, and the business community will be critical for success. Partnerships must be forged and strengthened to advance the implementation of many actions. All those who live and work on Cape Cod, as well as those who visit, will need to engage in advancing climate action. xCAPE COD CLIMATE ACTION PLAN ExECUTivE SUmmARY The Climate Action Plan provides a roadmap for various actors to move priority strategies forward and outlines an implementation plan to tackle the first steps. It provides detail on existing funding opportunities to support implementation, as well as new and innovative funding and financing methods to further explore. Each strategy requires engagement of a variety of actors. Governments will need to work together, across town boundaries, and across levels of government. Some entities are uniquely qualified to address certain actions; many other actions will require partnerships IMPLEMENTING to implement; yet others may present business opportunities.

Working collaboratively, forging new partnerships and building on established ones, and with broad engagement and participation, the region will rise to meet these challenges. xx1 introduction Climate change is transforming Cape Cod. Though rising seas and changes to the coastline may be the most dramatic evidence of climate change, it is impacting every facet of Cape Cod’s natural, built, and community systems. By the end of the century, damage to buildings and land lost to inundation on Cape Cod could alone total over $30 billion. As a region, our land use patterns and way of living dictate our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the leading cause of the global climate crisis. Climate action is necessary to slow the effects of climate change and improve the region’s resilience to its impacts. The Cape Cod Climate Action Plan provides a way forward for the region to mitigate and adapt to our changing climate and contribute to state emissions reductions goals. This plan is the result of an intensive effort, coordinated by the Cape Cod Commission, to engage the Cape Cod community, identify paths toward climate resiliency, and further develop partnerships necessary to implement climate actions.CAPE COD CLIMATE ACTION PLAN inTRoDUCTion The Climate Action Plan was developed The Commonwealth of Massachusetts aligns with the Commonwealth’s goal of during a time of increasing concern is taking significant strides in shifting the reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, about the changing global climate and state toward a net-zero carbon emissions but with a more immediate focus on the potentially devastating local effects goal by 2050.

GHGs occur naturally, and they are also emitted from human activities like using fossil fuels, through certain land management practices, or from manufacturing of products we use. in order to reduce or minimize the amount of GHGs the region emits, and to prevent climate change from worsening, it is critical to first understand the region’s sources of GHG emissions.CAPE COD CLIMATE ACTION PLAN CAPE CoD’S GREEnHoUSE GAS EmiSSionS A greenhouse gas emissions inventory is an accounting of the total greenhouse gas emissions for all man-made sources for a specific geography.

The Cape Cod Commission has led efforts to develop targeted regional plans meant to advance progress around specific issues of interest or concern, including elements that address climate resiliency and mitigation. other entities have also made significant contributions to address climate-responsible energy use and generation, and mitigate the region’s contribution to greenhouse gases. Towns have developed plans to adapt to climate impacts and have worked together at the subregional level to identify paths to greater coastal and climate resiliency.

        "Executive Summary Climate change is an unprecedented challenge that is transforming Cape Cod. Rising seas and changes to the coastline are the most dramatic evidence of climate change, but it is impacting every facet of Cape Cod’s natural, built, and community systems. By the end of the century, damage to Cape Cod’s buildings and land lost to inundation could alone total over $30 billion. Our land use patterns and way of living dictate our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the leading cause of the climate crisis. Dedicated and immediate action is necessary to slow the effects of climate change and improve the region’s resiliency to its impacts. The Cape Cod Climate Action Plan provides a framework for action to support a climate resilient region.",

        "1 introduction Climate change is transforming Cape Cod. Though rising seas and changes to the coastline may be the most dramatic evidence of climate change, it is impacting every facet of Cape Cod’s natural, built, and community systems. By the end of the century, damage to buildings and land lost to inundation on Cape Cod could alone total over $30 billion. As a region, our land use patterns and way of living dictate our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the leading cause of the global climate crisis. Climate action is necessary to slow the effects of climate change and improve the region’s resilience to its impacts. The Cape Cod Climate Action Plan provides a way forward for the region to mitigate and adapt to our changing climate and contribute to state emissions reductions goals. This plan is the result of an intensive effort, coordinated by the Cape Cod Commission, to engage the Cape Cod community, identify paths toward climate resiliency, and further develop partnerships necessary to implement climate actions.",
