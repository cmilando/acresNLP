SomerVision 2040 Introduction 1Outreach Strategy Our outreach strategy for SomerVision2040 centered residents themselves lead the discussion without City staff around offering multiple avenues for participation to reach present, then used a form to report back to us. Through individuals that do not typically attend our more traditional our SomerStories and our SomerVision online survey, evening public meetings due to either time constraints we received dozens of lengthy answers to open-ended or because they found giving feedback in those settings questions about both the challenges and opportunities too difficult. By mixing in-person and online engagement residents found living in Somerville, as well as their vision through formal and informal gatherings, both large and for the City’s future. small, we aimed at offering at least one option that each resident would find suitable. Through the combination of these various approaches, we received feedback in some form from over a thousand Our SomerVision card game gathered specific suggestions residents, ranging from general impressions to in-depth for the SomerVision Numbers from hundreds of residents. analysis, based on both personal experiences and general Our forums included only a few participants at a time but impressions. All the information we collected was carefully provided in-depth feedback from demographics typically analyzed by City staff and reported out to the SomerVision underrepresented in standard public processes such Committee across multiple meetings. Key points as non-English speaking immigrants, elderly residents, throughout our chapters, as well as our considerations for people with disabilities, small business owners, and teens. SomerVision numbers and spreads on special topics such Our SomerSuppers collected feedback from hundreds as displacement and racial equity, came directly from the of community members in informal settings where the extensive community feedback we received. In December 2018, prior to the public kickoff, City staff hosted a Summit for employees to engage in the SomerVision planning process. This was an important internal step to get feedback and generate energy to help the Office of Strategic Planning and Community Development , with the help of the SVC, complete the plan update. 2 Introduction SomerVision 2040SomerSuppers Participants hosted their own conversations at their homes, community organizations, and restaurants about life in Somerville. Organizers shared in-depth feedback through report-out forms. 23 SomerSuppers were hosted through Spring 2019.

These methods of outreach were fairly open-ended, and let participants share what was important to them about Somerville. Submissions came throughout Spring 2019. SomerVision Public SomerVision Forums Meetings Our nine forums, which were hosted These large meetings featured in a variety of languages and Staff presentations while typically focused on a specific topic small group activities or or group, enabled Staff to collect stations solicited feedback. feedback from in-depth We hosted three meetings in conversations.

By since its creation, SOIA has also expanded to advocating considering what everyone needs to be successful, it goes for immigrants locally and nationally; assisting them beyond equal opportunity for all community members with navigating social services, the immigration system, regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, completing processes such as an affordable housing or immigration status, nationality, ethnicity, income, age, business license application, and they have created safe and physical ability.

These maps would color neighborhoods red that had immigrants or people of color living there, deeming the neighborhoods too risky for mortgages and insurance. At the same time, the real estate industry would also not let immigrants or people of color move into white neighborhoods since it would affect the perceived risk for the residents that lived there already. When the GI Bill of 1944 was implemented, the “redlining” of minority neighborhoods meant that as white veterans were able to buy houses at record rates using their government benefits and insurance, Black veterans were largely unable to access these same resources they had earned. Redlining was outlawed in 1968, but the effect of these kinds of racist policies have a huge impact on Americans Comparison of white and nonwhite household median net worth today.

The implementation priorities are 15 tasks that the SomerVision Committee identified as the next key steps. Some may take more time than others, and some may require collaboration across many parties, but all are urgent and important. They are listed here in no particular order. • INCORPORATE EQUITY GOALS into new neighborhood • Study and implement ways to EXPAND THE ACCESSIBILITY plans and development proposals to embed the needs of OF CRITICAL CITY MEETINGS.

In order to achieve a multimodal and more environmentally-friendly system, as well as creating a community that is where people want to live, work, and play instead of cut through en route elsewhere, Somerville would benefit by reducing VMT. • Explore opportunities to create NEW GATHERING SPACES FOR YOUTH in the City. Ensure Somerville has at least one active Recreation or Youth Center accessible for all youth. • Explore how to provide AFFORDABLE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE PROGRAMS to all Somerville families. This effort should consider a city-run or city-supported child care program (similar to the French system), a babysitting cooperative in conjunction with the high school, and a program at the Visiting Nurses Associations that let the elderly engage with children. • Ensure all SPS SCHOOLS ARE TRUE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS with integrated academic, health and social services, yout development, and community supports. Tackling these implementation priorities will take collaboration among City departments (above) as well as collaboration within the community (below).TOPIC CHAPTERSAbout the Topic Chapters This section includes the topic chapters, which were in the previous spread.

For example, the City currently utilizes zero-sort recycling (a SomerVision 2030 recommendation), which often has the unfortunate side- effect of decreasing the efficacy of recycling programs. We should continually monitor the results of programs to make sure they’re still the best fit for our community and stated goals. GOALS AND TAKEAWAYS Expand messaging. Climate change solutions will entail Leverage control. Above all, Somerville needs to large changes for residents, local businesses, and how the understand what aspects of emissions we have control City operates. How can we help the community understand over, and what we can do within that realm to reset unconscious norms. For example, supporting permeable pavement or planting native plants or trees able to survive the anticipated heat. These must be deliberately considered and acted upon. Target behavior change. Behavior change is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The community wants to make better choices, but the City should support efforts to make “better choices” more intuitive and straightforward. Re-evaluate programs.

Someville will continue to see the impacts of climate change. We should investigate what actions Somerville can take to further reduce the immediate impacts of climate change that are likely by 2040. The City should put specific emphasis on serving low-income/high-vulnerability individuals with targeted climate change mitigation and emergency preparedness programs. For example, as tree cover mitigates the urban heat island effect, how can we expand the public realm to make more space available for tree plantings? We need to consider adaptations for the future and what avenues exist to ease them – how do we learn to live with heat.also for consumer good and transportation choices. • Familiarize residents with various funds for supporting sustainable development, or consider generating a fund and encouraging residents to donate towards maintaining/planting vegetation locally as an offset for air travel. • Incentivize landlords to make retrofits, which reduce fossil fuel emissions, improve indoor air quality, and increase resilience to flooding and heat extremes in older housing stock. • Support and encourage green leasing efforts. • Support implementation of the Stormwater Management Plan. • Educate renters to ask for average utility costs prior to renting. • Require education on residential energy efficiency measures and financial incentives as part of any City-sponsored first time homebuyer programs. • Build on the zoning overhaul and increase or add new sustainability metrics. • Publicize Somerville’s sustainability-related values more prominently. • Leverage social networks and citizen groups to share information and opportunities for reducing climate impacts, including food waste. • Consider the use of public benchmark data for friendly competition between consumers: disaggregate and publicize data for neighborhoods impacted by climate change. to recognize good behavior and galvanize those who • Adopt visible symbols of our commitments - explore can improve. opportunities to support renewable energy • Ensure that materials on climate change are production. translated into multiple languages and are available • Engage the community in conversations around to a wide diversity of groups, especially those most emergency response plans related to extreme 22 Topic Chapters SomerVision 2040weather events and disruptions to food supply due subpopulations.

Many Somerville residents groups are highly active on social media, which can be used to personalize city announcements or initiatives. • We should increase scientific literacy of City officials. Somerville already focuses on data-based problem solving. Enhance this by educating City staff and elected officials about new technologies, adaptation strategies, and other solutions. • Get more community members engaged in climate issues by building a citywide culture of sustainability. For example match engaged residents with those who are less able to devote time to understanding and acting upon climate mitigation initiatives. This could include initiatives like planting vegetable gardens, grocery shopping to minimize plastic consumption, or providing forums for high school SomerVision 2040 Topic Chapters 23students to learn about the issues. • Support public engagement. Somerville can identify, support, and disseminate grassroots efforts already underway and leverage these to drive changes, particularly in the emissions-heavy building and transportation sectors. • Expand data-driven action and establish protocols for data collection on local air quality on an ongoing and permanent basis. • Transportation and land-use planning decisions can lower traffic related air pollution and resident exposure. Somerville should leverage the planning process to: • Put standards in place for new buildings to ensure that indoor air pollution (allergens and particulate pollution) is significantly reduced from outside • Pursue protective ordinances in areas within 500’ of a high-traffic roadway • Mitigation measures for air pollution generation, such as EV stations • Emphasize road diet and walkability score; and • Emphasize transportation equity for transportation modes, but prioritize low emission mobility • Create programs to help existing property owners and tenants within 500’ of high capacity roadways. • Support pedestrians, cyclists, and additional scooters). public transit.

While many green spaces are used and appreciated, other resources like the Mystic River can be further developed as community spaces. New connectivity can help residents access and value the natural world. • Revisit historic precedents. Somerville used to have many more people, yet much less vehicular traffic. Engage with our history to better understand what low-emission living looked like in Somerville and how we can readapt it today. • Make thoughtful land use choices. Somerville neighborhoods are walkable, with good sidewalks and often many nearby services and destinations like stores and restaurants. Can neighborhoods further expand their self-sufficiency both to build social capital and minimize the need for vehicle trips? This initiative will be especially powerful if it includes job creation. • Consider grant programs or financing options for any retrofitting projects residents apply to their homes and/or modes of transport.

With these kinds of strengths, Somerville is poised for strong initiatives around commercial development, To take advantage of the opportunities commercial SomerVision 2040 Topic Chapters 27work is creating new challenges for those who wish to promote commercial development. As discussed in the Housing chapter, housing costs are rising, resulting in the displacement of many residents and a shortage of available housing stock. This causes problems for large employers looking to attract talent as well as small retail and restaurant businesses who are facing increasing challenges finding staff. Rising commercial rents are also affecting our small businesses that contribute to the very soul of Somerville neighborhoods. Smart policymaking can mitigate the role commercial development plays in these rising costs and protect the existing squares and main streets that are an important part of the Somerville community. Another challenge is preserving the artistic community in the City. Rising costs and affordability are the biggest The City’s technical assistance challenges artists cite in continuing to work in Somerville programs provide a variety of and have resulted in the displacement of some artistic support for small businesses in Somerville.

For many residents of Somerville, the city’s rich community ties are an essential part of its character and appeal and we should work to preserve its strengths and overcome its obstacles in this area. CHALLENGES & OPPORTUNITIES Somerville faces multiple threats to the strength and longevity of its community ties. The largest and most immediate threat is the rising costs of housing1 and the resulting displacement of residents. When residents are forced to leave the city because of untenable costs, their departure severs ties with neighbors and erodes the fabric of connections that make the city stronger. The threat of displacement is particularly strong for Somerville’s lower- income residents meaning that their community ties are most at risk. The resulting social isolation was recognized as a risk factor for all ages in the Somerville Wellbeing Report. While many current residents of Somerville are finding it necessary to move away, many new residents are moving to Somerville, especially young professionals. Between 2010 to 2017, the City’s population rose 7%, from 75,754 dropped nearly 20% and the number of residents between to 81,361 and the number of residents aged between 25- the ages of 35-54 also decreased3. The rapid influx of new 34 years old increased by an estimated 5,245 people to residents means new community ties need to be created so approximately one third of Somerville’s entire population2. that new residents feel a part of the broader community.

We need to prioritize helping ties of residents in other age groups. Somerville residents who want to stay in the city do so and devote significant resources towards supporting those GOALS AND TAKEAWAYS communities who are most at risk of displacement. Knowing the importance of community ties for the happiness and health of our city, Somerville must work to defend and strengthen this fabric of relationships. Somerville should prioritize the following goals and take action to advance them. Support families and promote their longevity in Somerville. Families have long been a building block of community in Somerville. Families often prefer to stay in one place longer and have more reasons to connect with the larger community (for example through schools, sports, activities) than the average individual. As a result, families can play an essential role in building the rich Help all residents connect. The current reality is that SomerVision 2040 Topic Chapters 35 LAOG YTIUQE Fight displacement. One of the largest threats to the community ties that we value so much is the rapid displacement of existing residents. When a long-time resident or family is displaced from Somerville, not only are their ties severed, but the entire fabric of community ties gets weaker. We should prioritize helping Somerville residents who want to stay in the city do so and lend extra support to those communities most at risk.

The transportation network within Somerville allows the population to be mobile and brings people and business into and out of the city. multiple modes of transportation, not all do. The city Residents and businesses are seeking out Somerville partly lacks strong north/south transit connections. In addition, because of its ease of access. However, transportation the topography and lack of north/south bicycle lanes capacity and infrastructure has not kept pace. Buses and can make cycling a challenge. The Assembly and Davis trains in Somerville are over capacity during rush hours. Square Neighborhoods have more transit and mobility Buses are stuck on congested streets and run infrequently options with train, bus, and multi-use paths than any other during off-hours. Cyclists and micro-mobility users share neighborhoods in Somerville. The City must recognize space with motor vehicles. People feel frustrated, angry, that the same convenient service is desired and necessary and sometimes unsafe during commutes. throughout Somerville. Historically, many groups have been left out of the transportation planning process, While most of Somerville residents enjoy access to which results in the inequitable distribution of resources. 54 Topic Chapters SomerVision 2040Communities of color, seniors, people with low-incomes, While the infrastructure needs for some new transportation youth, and persons with disabilities are disproportionately innovations are unknown, other infrastructure needs are impacted by transportation decisions but are often not easy to identify.

It is imperative that the City create ambitious Residents of Somerville, particularly East Somerville, suffer two-fold from roadways like I-93 and McGrath Highway. I-93 and McGrath cut off neighborhoods from other parts of the city and create high particulate rates from vehicular emissions. This results in increased health care costs and a higher risk of developing illnesses. While emissions are a large concern, noise pollution also has negative impacts on health and quality of life. There is an urgent need to reduce emissions in Somerville and to also make Somerville more resilient to transportation-induced public health concerns.

The City has increased spending on tree plantings but the trees face a tough physical environment and public perception is not always positive. People voice concerns about tree roots, leaves, allergies, and even species.

Although people may think parks have one use, such as a playground or playing field, there are many users in one space because generally people use open space that’s within easy access to their residence. Park designs should include elements for a wide variety of user. 66 Topic Chapters SomerVision 2040 LAOG YTIUQE Focus. The total acreage of open space is important, but so is access. Residents tend to enjoy open spaces within walking distance of their home. If parks are within walking distance, but separated by infrastructure like McGrath Highway or I-93, it is much less likely to be used. LAOG YTIUQE Native species are uniquely adapted to environments that mimic pre-contact conditions. When planted in appropriate locations, native species generally use fewer resources and contribute to an efficient and balanced ecosystem. When the conditions are right, native species may be able to grow easily once established, but when conditions are not right they are often outcompeted by invasive species. One of the most important benefits of native species is that they create habitat for native birds, pollinators, and wildlife. In this way, native species are proven to increase and protect biodiversity. The Public Space and Urban Forestry division has had a successful record of using many native species in appropriate locations in both our parks and streets and of creating Empower residents.

By mixing in-person and online engagement residents found living in Somerville, as well as their vision through formal and informal gatherings, both large and for the City’s future. small, we aimed at offering at least one option that each resident would find suitable.

In December 2018, prior to the public kickoff, City staff hosted a Summit for employees to engage in the SomerVision planning process.

        "REDLINING & RACIAL WEALTH GAP Historically, “residential security” maps served as guidelines for real estate professionals and loan officers. These maps would color neighborhoods red that had immigrants or people of color living there, deeming the neighborhoods too risky for mortgages and insurance. At the same time, the real estate industry would also not let immigrants or people of color move into white neighborhoods since it would affect the perceived risk for the residents that lived there already. When the GI Bill of 1944 was implemented, the “redlining” of minority neighborhoods meant that as white veterans were able to buy houses at record rates using their government benefits and insurance, Black veterans were largely unable to access these same resources they had earned.

While many green spaces are used and appreciated, other resources like the Mystic River can be further developed as community spaces. New connectivity can help residents access and value the natural world. • Revisit historic precedents. Somerville used to have many more people, yet much less vehicular traffic. Engage with our history to better understand what low-emission living looked like in Somerville and how we can readapt it today. • Make thoughtful land use choices. Somerville neighborhoods are walkable, with good sidewalks and often many nearby services and destinations like stores and restaurants. Can neighborhoods further expand their self-sufficiency both to build social capital and minimize the need for vehicle trips?

For many residents of Somerville, the city’s rich community ties are an essential part of its character and appeal and we should work to preserve its strengths and overcome its obstacles in this area. CHALLENGES & OPPORTUNITIES Somerville faces multiple threats to the strength and longevity of its community ties. The largest and most immediate threat is the rising costs of housing1 and the resulting displacement of residents. When residents are forced to leave the city because of untenable costs, their departure severs ties with neighbors and erodes the fabric of connections that make the city stronger. The threat of displacement is particularly strong for Somerville’s lower- income residents meaning that their community ties are most at risk. The resulting social isolation was recognized as a risk factor for all ages in the Somerville Wellbeing Report. While many current residents of Somerville are finding it necessary to move away, many new residents are moving to Somerville, especially young professionals.

When planted in appropriate locations, native species generally use fewer resources and contribute to an efficient and balanced ecosystem. When the conditions are right, native species may be able to grow easily once established, but when conditions are not right they are often outcompeted by invasive species. One of the most important benefits of native species is that they create habitat for native birds, pollinators, and wildlife.
