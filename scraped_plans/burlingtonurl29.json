First Street Foundation found that there are nearly 4.3 million residential homes (1–4 units) across the country with substantial flood 2051 risk (1% annual) that would result in economic damage. The research allows for the calculation of an average annual loss (AAL) statistic for $32.2 Billion each residential property in the contiguous United States, a key metric used to estimate the dollar value of damage associated with flood risk on an annualized basis. The Foundation found that while total expected annual loss for these properties across the U.S. is $20.0 billion this year, it grows to nearly $32.2 billion a year in 30 years—an increase 2021 of 61%—due to the impact of a changing climate. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that if all of these homes were to insure against $20.0 flood risk through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) current Billion pricing structure, those rates would need to increase 4.5 times to cover the risk. These patterns vary across the country, but consistently show an underestimation of economic flood risk in both coastal and inland regions.

The flood model takes into account building characteristics originally sourced from county assessor building codes and dwelling types at the Census block level to changing environmental factors including sea-level rise, increasing offices and the Microsoft/Mapbox building footprint database.2 approximate the “likely” building characteristics of each residence, cyclonic intensity, higher probabilities of cyclone landfall locations Property data were standardized and made available through defined as a residential dwelling with 1–4 units. at more northern latitudes, shifting precipitation patterns, and a third party provider to ensure attributes are consistent and changes in river discharge. meaningful across counties. Where those data are not available, A combination of USACE and Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) depth-damage functions were then applied to the First Street Property Characteristics Foundation Flood Model to compare deterministic flood hazard The standardized property assessor data provides the general layers created at two different time periods (the years 2021 and information for the more than 25.5 million properties with 2051) and six different return periods (2-year, 5-year, 20-year, 100- identified flood risk today, or into the future (in 30 years). This year, 250-year, and 500-year). dataset contains more than 300 property attributes. Of primary importance to this report is the geographic location of the property, its market value,5 automated valuation model (AVM) Flood Hazard Layer data value,6 number of stories and units, structure data, and the The First Street Foundation Flood Model3 was developed in foundation type. Additionally, where data were missing or out of partnership with Fathom and provides the hazard layers with date, they were substituted with NSI data, which provides a series 3m horizontal resolution at various return period intervals, of attributes required for flood hazard estimates down to the including 2-year, 5-year, 20-year, 100-year, 250-year, and 500-year Census Block level. The Census Block is the smallest geographic flood events in 2021 and 2051. The maximum flooding depth enumeration area in the U.S. Census geography catalogue and for each property is sampled at the perimeter of the building generally captures sub-neighborhood spatial geographies in footprint boundary, or at the property parcel centroid where which building codes, housing characteristics, and population building footprint data does not exist.

Making this data open to individual property owners and communities provides actionable information to homeowners and renters about the flood damage a property is likely to experience and allows them to make more informed decisions about risk reduction investments and flood insurance coverage. Nationally, such estimates may inform Congressional allocations of funds for hazard mitigation programs and major infrastructure projects aimed at reducing flood risk. At the state and local level, they enable more accurate cost-benefit analyses, which help determine whether these projects receive public funding. Annual flood damage estimates are often used in cost-benefit analyses that help determine how billions of federal, state, and local dollars are spent every year. First Street Foundation has signed agreements with several agencies and government sponsored enterprises to provide access to these flood risk data. The public availability of these data also gives state and local governments, as well as homeowners, advance insight into possible forthcoming changes in future risk-based prices insurance premiums. FEMA’s Risk Rating 2.0 will reportedly use a probabilistic flood risk model to estimate the risk to individual homeowners, and may change how the NFIP prices insurance premiums. Currently, those outside designated SHFAs can receive coverage at a substantially discounted rate, while flat rates apply to properties within the SFHA, irrespective of the specific flood risk carried by individual properties. Risk Rating 2.0 may price risk both in and outside of SFHAs based on property-specific risk factors, employing the best actuarial math to derive premiums.1 First Street Foundation’s AAL functions provide users with an understanding of how and why their premiums may change as a result of their properties’ flood risk, and how their risk and premiums could change over time with climate. Such data, derived using an open methodology, have not previously existed at the property level and allow for new insights in the area of AAL analysis. These data are based upon higher resolution and detail of flood risk information than that typically derived from other open sources. Informed by more comprehensive estimates of expected flood damages and greater knowledge of the impact of risk-reduction measures, decision-makers at every level of government can better identify the locations and measures that would be most beneficial in reducing flood risk. Communities and individual property owners may use the same information to more effectively manage negative externalities associated with flood risk through insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms. 1 National Flood Insurance Program: The Current Rating Structure and Risk Rating 2.0 (FEMA, Jan 2021).The Cost of Climate: America’s Growing Flood Risk I © First Street Foundation 2021 8 National Overview The previous research developed by First Street Foundation, Properties with Defining America’s Growing Risk, highlighted 14.6 million properties substantial flood risk across the country at substantial flood risk (1% annually) of flooding. 14.6 M Millions of these properties and property owners were previously either underestimating or entirely unaware of the risk they face because they are not located within a FEMA designated SFHA. Residential properties with estimated economic loss Some property owners with substantial flood risk, or their larger 4.3 M communities, may have taken steps to mitigate against flood damage, but an estimated 4.3 million residential properties remain at risk of economic loss due to damage from unmitigated flood risk.The Cost of Climate: America’s Growing Flood Risk I © First Street Foundation 2021 9 Notes and Definitions All results displayed throughout this report are applicable to residential Flood Risks: Any flood risk is calculated as inundation of 1cm or more to the building in the 500 year return properties with 1–4 units, within the contiguous United States, and with period (0.2% annual risk or 1/500), now or in the future. a probable financial loss due to flood risk. Average risk per property is reported to the nearest whole dollar for consistency across the study, Substantial flood risk is calculated as inundation of 1cm or more to the building in the 100 year return period (1% annual risk or 1/100). but this does not imply a precision to the nearest dollar for any one property’s assessment of risk. 1 Extreme flood risk considers all residential properties with a Flood Factor® of 9 or 10, which are highly likely to experience frequent floods, severe floods, or both over a 30 year period. See the First Street Foundation Flood Model methodology2 for full details. The following First Street Foundation definitions of risk are used in this Estimated Average Annual Losses (AAL): report, and are used to compare to risk defined by FEMA’s designated AAL estimates are determined by using the established USACE depth damage functions for riverine SFHA. and storm surge flooding, and a newly derived, conservative depth damage function of precipitation- induced flooding developed by First Street Foundation. Averages of AAL are determined across properties with structural flood damage risk. In any comparison of the Foundation’s AAL to NFIP premiums, AAL is capped at $250,000 annually to match the NFIP coverage limit. In areas where it is not specifically compared to NFIP premiums, annual costs are not capped in any way. These figures do not include damage to the contents, commission, interest, or overhead of policies and do not discount deductibles. Estimated Average Annual NFIP Premiums: Estimates are determined using the NFIP’s Flood Insurance Manual and Rate Tables3 based on FEMA flood zone, relevant property characteristics, and the height of the first floor relative to base flood elevation. To compare NFIP premiums to AAL, AAL is capped at $250,000 annually to match the NFIP coverage limit. Whenever used, FEMA zones are estimated by MassiveCert Inc, and include any publicly available map amendments. These figures do not include damage to the building contents, nor commission, interest, or overhead of policies and excludes discount deductibles. Averages are for residential properties (1–4 units) with economic loss per First Street Foundation’s methods. 1 Damage estimates are derived from historic insurance payouts against damage to the structure. As such, these are estimated damages and may vary at the property level.

Looking at current risk, the top five states for highest per Avg. expected $24,000 annual loss per property potential economic loss estimates are all led by coastal property with risk, 2021 DDEE communities. This is highest in Delaware where the 11,665 $22,000 residential properties projected to incur economic damage have an average estimated annual loss of $22,646 per property. $20,000 Delaware is followed by South Carolina with $14,988 in estimated potential structural damage per property, Florida ($8,778), Washington ($8,141), and California ($7,462). $18,000 Even more pronounced is the concentration of future risk in $16,000 coastal states with changing climate conditions. Louisiana is SSCC projected to increase its total expected annualized economic risk $14,000 by 245% over the next 30 years. This large increase is primarily due to the fact that while Louisiana is heavily adapted to today’s $12,000 environment, it will still require significant economic investment in future adaptations to continue to be a viable place to live into the $10,000 future. It is also consistent with the larger narrative of the top 17 states in this metric all being coastal.

        "The Cost of Climate: America’s Growing Flood Risk I © First Street Foundation 2021 3 Abstract New research from First Street Foundation quantifies the financial impact of flood risk carried by American homeowners and how those dangers are growing as flood risks worsen due to a rapidly changing climate. First Street Foundation found that there are nearly 4.3 million residential homes (1–4 units) across the country with substantial flood 2051 risk (1% annual) that would result in economic damage. The research allows for the calculation of an average annual loss (AAL) statistic for $32.2 Billion each residential property in the contiguous United States, a key metric used to estimate the dollar value of damage associated with flood risk on an annualized basis. The Foundation found that while total expected annual loss for these properties across the U.S. is $20.0 billion this year, it grows to nearly $32.2 billion a year in 30 years—an increase 2021 of 61%—due to the impact of a changing climate. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that if all of these homes were to insure against $20.0 flood risk through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) current Billion pricing structure, those rates would need to increase 4.5 times to cover the risk. These patterns vary across the country, but consistently show an underestimation of economic flood risk in both coastal and inland regions. Click here to access the data presented in this report.",

The flood model takes into account building characteristics originally sourced from county assessor building codes and dwelling types at the Census block level to changing environmental factors including sea-level rise, increasing offices and the Microsoft/Mapbox building footprint database.2 approximate the “likely” building characteristics of each residence, cyclonic intensity, higher probabilities of cyclone landfall locations Property data were standardized and made available through defined as a residential dwelling with 1–4 units. at more northern latitudes, shifting precipitation patterns, and a third party provider to ensure attributes are consistent and changes in river discharge. meaningful across counties.

        "The Cost of Climate: America’s Growing Flood Risk I © First Street Foundation 2021 7 Policy Implications Accurate, comprehensive, and publicly available estimates of annual flood damages enable improved risk management and more cost-effective hazard mitigation planning at every level. Making this data open to individual property owners and communities provides actionable information to homeowners and renters about the flood damage a property is likely to experience and allows them to make more informed decisions about risk reduction investments and flood insurance coverage. Nationally, such estimates may inform Congressional allocations of funds for hazard mitigation programs and major infrastructure projects aimed at reducing flood risk. At the state and local level, they enable more accurate cost-benefit analyses, which help determine whether these projects receive public funding. Annual flood damage estimates are often used in cost-benefit analyses that help determine how billions of federal, state, and local dollars are spent every year. First Street Foundation has signed agreements with several agencies and government sponsored enterprises to provide access to these flood risk data. The public availability of these data also gives state and local governments, as well as homeowners, advance insight into possible forthcoming changes in future risk-based prices insurance premiums. FEMA’s Risk Rating 2.0 will reportedly use a probabilistic flood risk model to estimate the risk to individual homeowners, and may change how the NFIP prices insurance premiums. Currently, those outside designated SHFAs can receive coverage at a substantially discounted rate, while flat rates apply to properties within the SFHA, irrespective of the specific flood risk carried by individual properties. Risk Rating 2.0 may price risk both in and outside of SFHAs based on property-specific risk factors, employing the best actuarial math to derive premiums.1 First Street Foundation’s AAL functions provide users with an understanding of how and why their premiums may change as a result of their properties’ flood risk, and how their risk and premiums could change over time with climate. Such data, derived using an open methodology, have not previously existed at the property level and allow for new insights in the area of AAL analysis. These data are based upon higher resolution and detail of flood risk information than that typically derived from other open sources. Informed by more comprehensive estimates of expected flood damages and greater knowledge of the impact of risk-reduction measures, decision-makers at every level of government can better identify the locations and measures that would be most beneficial in reducing flood risk. Communities and individual property owners may use the same information to more effectively manage negative externalities associated with flood risk through insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms. 1 National Flood Insurance Program: The Current Rating Structure and Risk Rating 2.0 (FEMA, Jan 2021).",

Louisiana is SSCC projected to increase its total expected annualized economic risk $14,000 by 245% over the next 30 years. This large increase is primarily due to the fact that while Louisiana is heavily adapted to today’s $12,000 environment, it will still require significant economic investment in future adaptations to continue to be a viable place to live into the $10,000 future.

Mike Amodeo Sharai Lewis-Gruss To assess estimates of flood damage, the Foundation derived Average Annual Loss (AAL) values using automated Dr. Saman Armal Brett Lingle valuation models (AVM) from ComeHome by HouseCanary, a leading source for property values and related data. Sara Chadwick Mike Lopes Ziyan Chu Dr. Michael Marston Matthew Eby David Miller Colleen Ensor Natalie Pardy To define building characteristics, improvement percentages, and property parcel details, the Foundation Neil Freeman Dr. Jeremy Porter leveraged data from LightBox, a leading provider of CRE data and workflow solutions. Raphaël Halloran Leilani Rose Ho Hsieh Nathan Rosler Angela Jin Daniel Seripap Mike Kaminski Miguel Vacas Shannon Keane Ray Yong To calculate flood depths to the building structure, the Foundation leveraged building footprint data supplied by Dr. Edward J. Kearns Gabriel Zarate Mapbox. Mapbox also provided geocode lookups and map integrations for the Flood Factor experience. Kelvin Lai Ralph Zagha Marguerite Lally To identify the FEMA flood zones for each property, the Foundation partnered with MassiveCert to derive the FEMA Disclaimers zone estimate from both digitized and non-digitized maps.
