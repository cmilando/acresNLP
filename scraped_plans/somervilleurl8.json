SomerVision 2040 Introduction 1Outreach Strategy Our outreach strategy for SomerVision2040 centered residents themselves lead the discussion without City staff around offering multiple avenues for participation to reach present, then used a form to report back to us. Through individuals that do not typically attend our more traditional our SomerStories and our SomerVision online survey, evening public meetings due to either time constraints we received dozens of lengthy answers to open-ended or because they found giving feedback in those settings questions about both the challenges and opportunities too difficult. By mixing in-person and online engagement residents found living in Somerville, as well as their vision through formal and informal gatherings, both large and for the City’s future. small, we aimed at offering at least one option that each resident would find suitable. Through the combination of these various approaches, we received feedback in some form from over a thousand Our SomerVision Card Game gathered specific suggestions residents, ranging from general impressions to in-depth for the SomerVision Numbers from hundreds of residents. analysis, based on both personal experiences and Our Forums included only a few participants at a time but general perceptions.

In December 2018, prior to the public kickoff, City staff hosted a Summit for employees to engage in the SomerVision planning process. This was an important internal step to get feedback and generate energy to help the Office of Strategic Planning and Community Development , with the help of the SVC, complete the plan update. 2 Introduction SomerVision 2040SomerSuppers Participants hosted their own conversations at their homes, community organizations, and restaurants about life in Somerville.

SomerVision 2040 Introduction 5REDLINING & RACIAL WEALTH GAP Historically, “residential security” maps served as guidelines for real estate professionals and loan officers. These maps would color neighborhoods that had immigrants or people of color living there red, deeming the neighborhoods too risky for mortgages and insurance. At the same time, the real estate industry would also not let immigrants or people of color move into white neighborhoods since it would affect the perceived risk for the residents that lived there already. When the GI Bill of 1944 was implemented, the “redlining” of minority neighborhoods meant that as white veterans were able to buy houses at record rates using their government benefits and insurance, Black veterans were largely unable to access these same resources they had earned. Redlining was outlawed in 1968, but the effect of these kinds of racist policies have a huge impact on Americans Comparison of white and nonwhite household median net worth today.

The implementation priorities are 15 tasks that the SomerVision Committee identified as the next key steps. Some may take more time than others, and some may require collaboration across many parties, but all are urgent and important. They are listed here in no particular order. • INCORPORATE EQUITY GOALS into new neighborhood • Study and implement ways to EXPAND THE ACCESSIBILITY plans and development proposals to embed the needs of OF CRITICAL CITY MEETINGS.

In order to achieve a multimodal and more environmentally-friendly system, as well as creating a community that is where people want to live, work, and play instead of cut through en route elsewhere, Somerville would benefit by reducing VMT. • Explore opportunities to create NEW GATHERING SPACES FOR YOUTH in the City. Ensure Somerville has at least one active Recreation or Youth Center accessible for all youth. • Explore how to provide AFFORDABLE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE PROGRAMS to all Somerville families. This effort should consider a city-run or city-supported child care program (similar to the French system), a babysitting cooperative in conjunction with the high school, and a program at the Visiting Nurses Associations that lets seniors engage with children. • Ensure all SPS SCHOOLS ARE TRUE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS with integrated academic, health and social services, yout development, and community supports. Tackling these implementation priorities will take collaboration among City departments (above) as well as collaboration within the community (below).Implementation - One Step at a Time With a vision sketched out, the time comes to begin 1. Spread the word. Our first task will be to translate implementing SomerVision 2040. It will take everyone—our SomerVision 2040 and create an accessible web elected officials, City staff, and proactive residents—to bring version of the document. In addition, City staff will our ideas to life. Key Implementation Steps: be sharing SomerVision 2040 internally, so that every department is familiar with what the community’s priorities are. We want our shared vision to be accessible and welcoming to all. 2. Establish a new committee. The new SomerVision Committee, made up of City staff, residents, and elected officials, can meet as necessary to ensure progress towards our goals. This committee should work closely with the City’s Racial and Social Justice Director (to be hired) to keep equity at the forefront of the implementation work. 3. Continue to identify priority initiatives. The Implementation Priorities are the top projects Photo from Daddy Jones Instagram identified by the SomerVision Committee, but these priorities may shift over time. The SomerVision Committee will play an important role in considering which initiatives need more attention and identifying strategies for pushing these efforts forward. 4. Share regular updates. Once a year, City staff will release information about the activities of the SomerVision Committee, progress towards the SomerVision Numbers, and actions relating to the Implementation Priorities.

Climate change solutions will entail Leverage control. Above all, Somerville needs to large changes for residents, local businesses, and how the understand what aspects of emissions we have control City operates. How can we help the community understand over, and what we can do within that realm to reset and accept these changes prior to implementation? unconscious norms. For example, supporting permeable pavement or planting native plants or trees able to survive the anticipated heat. These must be deliberately considered and acted upon. Target behavior change. Behavior change is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The community wants to make better choices, but the City should support efforts to make “better choices” more intuitive and straightforward. Re-evaluate programs. Programs that were the right fit for the Somerville of 10, 20, 50 years ago, might not be the right fit for the Somerville of today. For example, the City 22 Topic Chapters SomerVision 2040 LAOG YTIUQE Focus on our largest GHG contributor. Buildings are the largest contributor to Somerville’s emissions, and we need to continue to focus on them even though we have limited leverage. We need to support building retrofits, keeping in mind that improvements resulting in cost of living increases is an undesirable outcome.Continue to educate and incentivize. Somerville can think creatively about how to incentivize positive behavior change (for example commuting by bike instead of by car or having a public forum to formalize commitments to fly less like Europe’s No-Fly Pledges. Integrate sustainability in other City objectives. Whether the city budget, neighborhood planning, or regulation, we need to integrate sustainability in all City processes, especially the way we live and move about. Include food. Food systems are both heavily impacted providers in creating a more cohesive network for receiving and distributing recoverable food. Prioritize Infrastructure. Our infrastructure plays a critical role in improving our sustainability and resiliency to future climate events. We should explore traditional and innovative ways of addressing our problems. POTENTIAL TASKS • Align sustainability values with existing city programs and policies. • Continue to pursue policies that make Somerville less dependent on fossil fuel emissions. • Develop a plan and guidelines for combating urban heat island impacts. and contributors to climate change and a community’s • Develop policy incentives to encourage sustainable resilience. In line with the Somerville Food Assessment behavior relating to consumer awareness – findings, Somerville should aim to minimize the amount particularly for building energy consumption, but of food that is wasted and support local emergency food also for consumer good and transportation choices. SomerVision 2040 Topic Chapters 23 LAOG YTIUQE Plan ahead. Someville will continue to see the impacts of climate change. We should investigate what actions Somerville can take to further reduce the immediate impacts of climate change that are likely by 2040. The City should put specific emphasis on serving low-income and high-vulnerability individuals with targeted climate change mitigation and emergency preparedness programs. For example, as tree cover mitigates the urban heat island effect, how can we expand tree cover to make more space available for tree plantings on public and private property? We need to consider adaptations for the future and what avenues exist to ease them – how do we learn to live with heat.• Familiarize residents with various funds for supporting sustainable development, or consider generating a fund and encouraging residents to donate towards maintaining/planting vegetation locally as an offset for air travel. • Incentivize landlords to make retrofits, which reduce fossil fuel emissions, improve indoor air quality, and increase resilience to flooding and heat extremes in older housing stock. • Support and encourage green leasing efforts. • Support implementation of the Stormwater Management Plan. • Educate renters to ask for average utility costs prior to renting. • Require education on residential energy efficiency measures and financial incentives as part of any City-sponsored first time homebuyer programs. • Build on the zoning overhaul and increase or add new sustainability metrics. • Publicize Somerville’s sustainability-related values more prominently. • Leverage social networks and citizen groups to share information and opportunities for reducing climate impacts, including food waste. • Consider the use of public benchmark data for friendly competition between consumers: disaggregate and publicize data for neighborhoods to recognize good behavior and galvanize those who • Adopt visible symbols of our commitments - explore can improve. opportunities to support renewable energy • Ensure that materials on climate change are production. translated into multiple languages and are available • Engage the community in conversations around to a wide diversity of groups, especially those most emergency response plans related to extreme impacted by climate change. weather events and disruptions to food supply due 24 Topic Chapters SomerVision 2040to climate change impacts.

Many Somerville residents groups are Forward planning process. highly active on social media, which can be used to personalize city announcements or initiatives. • We should increase scientific literacy of City officials. Somerville already focuses on data-based problem solving. Enhance this by educating City staff and elected officials about new technologies, adaptation strategies, and other solutions. • Get more community members engaged in climate issues by building a citywide culture of sustainability. For example match engaged residents with those who are less able to devote time to understanding and acting upon climate mitigation initiatives. This could include initiatives like planting vegetable gardens, grocery shopping to minimize plastic consumption, or providing forums for high school students to learn about the issues. • Support public engagement. Somerville can identify, support, and disseminate grassroots efforts already SomerVision 2040 Topic Chapters 25underway and leverage these to drive changes, particularly in the emissions-heavy building and transportation sectors. • Expand data-driven action and establish protocols for data collection on local air quality on an ongoing and permanent basis. • Transportation and land-use planning decisions can lower traffic related air pollution and resident exposure. Somerville should leverage the planning process to: • Put standards in place for new buildings to ensure that indoor air pollution (allergens and particulate pollution) is significantly reduced from outside • Pursue protective ordinances in areas within 500’ of a high-traffic roadway • Mitigation measures for air pollution generation, such as EV stations • Emphasize road diet and walkability score; and • Emphasize transportation equity for transportation modes, but prioritize low emission mobility • Create programs to help existing property owners and tenants within 500’ of high capacity roadways. • Support pedestrians, cyclists, and additional public transit. Between traffic gridlock and MBTA dysfunction, the timing is right to experiment with alternative methods like biking, Mystic River ferry other changes to reduce vehicle miles traveled and service, dedicated bus lanes, street cars, paratransit, consequent emissions. These opportunities include and micro-mobility (for example electric bikes and restricting parking permits in transit-accessible scooters). areas, increasing the cost of city parking permits, and • Leverage the Green Line Extension. This major change reducing street parking in favor of space for carbon gives the city a window of opportunity to make neutral (or even negative) emissions, like bike lanes 26 Topic Chapters SomerVision 2040or more trees. • Take full advantage of existing natural resources. While many green spaces are used and appreciated, other resources like the Mystic River can be further developed as community spaces. New connectivity can help residents access and value the natural world. • Revisit historic precedents. Somerville used to have many more people, yet much less vehicular traffic. Engage with our history to better understand what low-emission living looked like in Somerville and how we can readapt it today. • Make thoughtful land use choices. Somerville neighborhoods are walkable, with good sidewalks and often many nearby services and destinations like stores and restaurants. Can neighborhoods further expand their self-sufficiency both to build social capital and minimize the need for vehicle trips? This initiative will be especially powerful if it includes job creation. • Consider grant programs or financing options for any retrofitting projects residents apply to their homes and/or modes of transport. • Evaluate waste streams including trash, recycling, and organic waste. Past solutions may not be 2040 solutions. New technologies may make for more efficient waste disposal. SomerVision 2040 Topic Chapters 27Commercial Development, Business, & Arts Commercial development plays an important role in the The SomerVision Number future of Somerville as it provides revenue to support City services, brings jobs to residents that can reduce 1:1 commutes, and provides a larger daytime population for existing retail and service businesses.

As discussed in the Housing chapter, housing costs are rising, resulting in the displacement of many residents and a shortage of available housing stock. This causes problems for large employers looking to attract talent as well as small retail and restaurant businesses who are facing increasing challenges finding staff. Rising commercial rents are also affecting our small businesses that contribute to the very soul of Somerville neighborhoods. Smart policymaking can mitigate the role commercial development plays in these rising costs and protect the existing squares and main streets that are an important part of the Somerville community. Another challenge is preserving the artistic community The City’s technical assistance in the City.

The City has replaced thousands of feet of older water mains, but struggles to catch up with the mounting needs of aging infrastructure. This backlog means that much of the budget is spent on emergency repairs, which are less cost-effective than proactive upgrades. In addition, much of the underground infrastructure needs are unknown. While the City has managed to assess the condition of some underground water and sewer infrastructure, the vast majority needs to be investigated. This makes it difficult to ascertain the resources and effort needed to not only maintain infrastructure but address its vulnerabilities.

SomerVision 2040 Topic Chapters 55Transportation Equity Partnership (STEP) and the Somerville Bicycle Advisory Committee (SBAC). Somerville residents are also vocal outside of organized groups in calls for increased transportation equity and access. Based on the 2017 U.S. Census American Community Survey, more than half of Somerville residents use sustainable modes of transportation to travel for work. Based on data collected by the City and its partners (including this Committee in SomerSuppers and other efforts) Somerville residents express a strong desire for safe, convenient access to sustainable transportation options for the majority of their trips. Residents want reliable public transportation access, safe bicycle lanes, and freedom of movement within the city with decreased congestion. This support encourages the City to make necessary investments in mobility planning and infrastructure. In step with this desire, the Administration committed to Vision Zero in 2017 and the Mobility division has created a Vision Zero Action Plan. Vision Zero aims to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries on Somerville’s streets.

Residents tend to enjoy open spaces within walking distance of their home. If parks are within walking distance, but separated by infrastructure like McGrath Highway or I-93, it is much less likely to be used. LAOG YTIUQE Native species are uniquely adapted to environments that mimic pre-contact conditions. When planted in appropriate locations, native species generally use fewer resources and contribute to an efficient and balanced ecosystem. When the conditions are right, native species may be able to grow easily once established, but when conditions are not right they are often outcompeted by invasive species. One of the most important benefits of native species is that they create habitat for native birds, pollinators, and wildlife. In this way, native species are proven to increase and protect biodiversity. The Public Space and Urban Forestry division has had a successful record of using many Empower residents.

In partnership with the City and the Somerville community, the Children’s Cabinet is continuing our work as a founding member of the Harvard Education Redesign Lab’s By All Means initiative. The initiative looks at ways that we can work together as a community to develop a comprehensive child wellbeing and education system to eliminate the link between a child’s socioeconomic status and academic achievement. Working together and in concert with other communities across the United States committed to leveling the playing field, Somerville is finding ways to leverage its resources and passion to remove barriers and eliminate opportunity gaps. 72 Topic Chapters SomerVision 2040A key focus of By All Means has been strengthening extended learning opportunities, particularly for students High housing costs and competition for family-sized units of color and older students who have been traditionally makes it difficult for families with children to move to underrepresented in afterschool and summer learning or remain in Somerville.

Specifically, teenagers discussed how teachers are responsible for recommending what level of class a student takes and wondered if fewer students of color were ending up in advanced placement or honors classes than their white peers. Furthermore, students of color are more likely to drop out of school.

        "REDLINING & RACIAL WEALTH GAP Historically, “residential security” maps served as guidelines for real estate professionals and loan officers. These maps would color neighborhoods that had immigrants or people of color living there red, deeming the neighborhoods too risky for mortgages and insurance. At the same time, the real estate industry would also not let immigrants or people of color move into white neighborhoods since it would affect the perceived risk for the residents that lived there already. When the GI Bill of 1944 was implemented, the “redlining” of minority neighborhoods meant that as white veterans were able to buy houses at record rates using their government benefits and insurance, Black veterans were largely unable to access these same resources they had earned. Redlining was outlawed in 1968, but the effect of these kinds of racist policies have a huge impact on Americans Comparison of white and nonwhite household median net worth today.

The new SomerVision Committee, made up of City staff, residents, and elected officials, can meet as necessary to ensure progress towards our goals. This committee should work closely with the City’s Racial and Social Justice Director (to be hired) to keep equity at the forefront of the implementation work. 3. Continue to identify priority initiatives. The Implementation Priorities are the top projects Photo from Daddy Jones Instagram identified by the SomerVision Committee, but these priorities may shift over time. The SomerVision Committee will play an important role in considering which initiatives need more attention and identifying strategies for pushing these efforts forward. 4. Share regular updates.

Somerville residents are also vocal outside of organized groups in calls for increased transportation equity and access. Based on the 2017 U.S. Census American Community Survey, more than half of Somerville residents use sustainable modes of transportation to travel for work. Based on data collected by the City and its partners (including this Committee in SomerSuppers and other efforts) Somerville residents express a strong desire for safe, convenient access to sustainable transportation options for the majority of their trips. Residents want reliable public transportation access, safe bicycle lanes, and freedom of movement within the city with decreased congestion. This support encourages the City to make necessary investments in mobility planning and infrastructure. In step with this desire, the Administration committed to Vision Zero in 2017 and the Mobility division has created a Vision Zero Action Plan.

When planted in appropriate locations, native species generally use fewer resources and contribute to an efficient and balanced ecosystem. When the conditions are right, native species may be able to grow easily once established, but when conditions are not right they are often outcompeted by invasive species. One of the most important benefits of native species is that they create habitat for native birds, pollinators, and wildlife.
