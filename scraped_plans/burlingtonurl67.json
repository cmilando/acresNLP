The U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes (MXP) measure changes in the price of goods and services traded between the United States and its top five trading partners (Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, and Germany). Box 3-A Freight Analysis Framework The Freight Analysis Framework (FAF), produced through a partnership between the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and the Federal Highway Administration, integrates data from a variety of sources to create a comprehensive picture of freight movement among states and major metropolitan areas by major commodity groups and by all modes of transportation. Primarily based on data from the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS), FAF incorporates data from international trade, agriculture, extraction, utility, construction, service, and other sectors. FAF version 5 (FAF5) provides estimates for tonnage, value, and ton-miles by regions of origin and destination, commodity type, and mode. Data are available for the base year (currently 2017), the recent years (2018–2022), and forecast year estimates through 2050. Data may be accessed through the FAF Data Tabulation Tool. 3-2Transportation Statistics Annual Report 2023 Table 3-1 Gross Output of Freight System-Dependent Industry Sectors: 2017–2022 (Billions of 2017 Chained Dollars) Industry sector 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Total of sectors highly dependent on transportation and warehousing 13,768.1 14,181.9 14,165.9 13,446.8 14,177.3 14,231.4 Sectors highly dependent on transportation and warehousing Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting 448.9 447.2 440.1 454.5 454.8 434.8 Mining 462.8 536.2 568.2 471.8 501.7 531.9 Utilities 474.1 496.4 492.9 481.5 492.5 507.1 Construction 1,578.0 1,601.3 1,614.9 1,643.6 1,669.3 1,564.3 Manufacturing 5,676.6 5,786.4 5,724.7 5,335.3 5,498.2 5,541.9 Wholesale trade 2,053.9 2,115.5 2,089.1 1,986.7 2,203.5 2,198.7 Retail trade 1,846.9 1,914.6 1,932.0 1,931.2 2,089.5 2,092.2 Transportation and warehousing 1,226.9 1,284.3 1,304.0 1,142.2 1,267.8 1,360.5 NOTES: Chain dollars adjust for inflation over time allowing for equitable comparisons among dollar amounts.

In 2022, the flow of barges along the Mississippi River was hampered by reduced water levels caused by what is termed a “flash drought.” This unusual weather phenomenon, which had previously occurred mainly over the Missouri and Ohio tributaries, now centered itself over the Central United States, affecting the Mississippi River. The flash drought led to increased soil absorption of water and heightened water evaporation, consequently diminishing water levels along the Mississippi River, particularly between Cairo, Illinois and Memphis, Tennessee. B. 2021 As reported in TSAR 2022, these lower river draft conditions prevented barge fleets from operating at full capacity, resulting in a significant surge in barge freight rates.

Note the data refer to Nonbooked transits; these are transits that are made without vessel transit reservations and are therefore subject to transit waiting times. Container ships normally obtain reservations and thus would not experience more than nominal waiting. Dry bulk vessels, which carry U.S. grains and other bulk commodities, normally do not acquire reservations and thus are susceptible to extended waiting times when the Canal Authority imposes transit restrictions, that is, the number of transits that are permitted to proceed through the Canal each day. 3-24Transportation Statistics Annual Report 2023 Figure 3-14 Vessel Draft Restrictions on the Panama Canal (in Meters) by Locks NOTES: Panamax and Neopanamax refer to the maximum vessel size that each lock can handle. Panamax vessels typically have maximum dimensions of approximately 965 feet (294.13 meters) in length, 106 feet (32.31 meters) in width, and a draft (the submerged depth of the ship) of about 39.5 feet (12 meters). For container ships, these dimensions will allow vessels of about 4,500-5,000 TEU capacity. Ships that exceed these dimensions transit through the Neopanamax locks. Neopanamax vessels have lengths of up to 1,200 feet (366 meters), widths of up to 160 feet (49 meters), and drafts generally within the range of generally between 39.5+ feet (12+ meters) to 50 feet (15.2 meters).

This contribution to the economy, as measured by the TSAs, is less than the final demand attributed to transportation (Figure 4-1) because it counts only the contribution of transportation services and not transportation goods (e.g., the contribution from motor vehicle manufacturing).

In-house transportation services consist of air, rail, truck, and water transportation services produced by nontransportation industries for their own use (e.g., grocery stores owning and operating their own trucks to move goods from distribution centers to retail locations). BTS calculates the contribution of household transportation as the depreciation associated with households owning a motor vehicle.

Cost of Transportation Emerging Issues: Inflation and The cost to produce transportation services Transportation stems from the resources firms purchase, such as fuel and labor, that are required to produce Inflation occurs when prices rise and purchasing these transportation services. For example, power weakens over time. Inflation includes the airlines pay for pilots, commercial jets, and jet prices faced by consumers for transportation, as fuel to provide air transportation services. The measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) cost of the resources used by producers of for items such as motor vehicles, gasoline, transportation services influences the prices and airfares. It also includes the transportation they charge businesses and households for costs, as measured in the Producer Price Index transportation services.

As context, it is useful to review the year-to- year change in motor vehicle fatalities in recent Highway Motor Vehicles2 years. In 2011, after decades of decline, motor vehicle related fatalities had fallen to 32,479, As shown in Figure 5-1, highway motor the lowest number since 1949. Over the next 5 vehicles were involved in 95.5 percent of years, fatalities rose by about 5,400, reaching U.S. transportation fatalities in 2021 and also, 37,806 in 2016. As shown in Table 5-1, deaths as shown in Table 5-2, 99.5 percent of the then declined each year in 2017, 2018, and people injured in transportation crashes and 2019 to 36,355, but were still 12 percent more incidents. Both the number and rate of highway than that in 2011. Then came the COVID-19 fatalities have decreased notably over the last 1 As for the decade between 2011 and 2020, about 376,000 people died in transportation incidents, of which all but about 22,000 involved highway motor vehicles. While fatalities averaged about 37,600 fatalities per year over the 10 years, there was considerable year-by-year variation: deaths in 2011 were at their lowest point in 6 decades, then rose for 5 straight years through 2016, before falling in 2017–2019 and then rising steeply in 2020, the first pandemic year. 2 Highway-Rail Grade crossing crashes are discussed in the subsection of the chapter called “Ignoring risks and warnings.” Figure 5-1 Transportation Fatalities by Mode: 2021 SOURCE: U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, National Transportation Statistics, Table 2-1, available at www.transportation.gov as of August 2023. 5-3Chapter 5—Transportation Safety Table 5-1 Transportation Fatalities by Mode: 2016–2022 Change from 2020 to Mode 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2021 TOTAL fatalities 39,753 39,364 38,755 38,424 41,041 44,959 NA ▲ Air 413 347 396 455 358 371 NA ▲ (EE) Highway 37,806 37,473 36,835 36,355 39,007 42,939 42,795 ▲ Railroad1 631 677 661 723 632 724 777 ▲ Transit rail2 150 151 174 173 176 197 222 ▲ Water 737 709 682 707 853 715 686 ▼ Pipeline 16 7 7 11 15 13 5 ▼ Other counts, redundant with above U.S. Air carrier3 0 0 1 4 0 0 NA On-demand air taxi and commuter carrier 27 16 16 34 26 27 NA ▲ General aviation 386 331 379 417 332 344 NA ▲ Railroad, trespasser deaths not at highway-rail crossing 468 505 499 534 503 581 619 ▲ Railroad, killed at public crossing with motor vehicle 130 140 132 128 94 128 145 ▲ Rail, passenger operations 254 307 254 262 186 203 296 ▲ Rail, freight operations 507 510 539 589 540 649 626 ▲ Transit, non-rail 109 98 86 95 113 124 116 ▲ Recreational boating 701 658 633 613 767 658 636 ▼ Commercial waterborne 36 51 49 94 86 57 50 ▼ 1 Includes Amtrak.

NHTSA released initial data in June 2022. One set of data is for Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Programs and the other for SAE Levels 3–5 automated driving systems (currently, vehicles now being road tested that are capable of car control without a human driver). Of the 130 incidents involving automated driving systems in the data posted in June 2022, 108 involved crashes with another vehicle, and 11 involved a pedestrian or bicyclist or other vulnerable road users, such as motorcyclists, but no serious injuries were reported. As for vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, 116 involved collisions with another vehicle, and 4 involved a pedestrian or other vulnerable road user. Serious injuries or fatalities occurred in 11 of the 98 episodes in which crash severity was reported [USDOT NHTSA b]. These initial data are not sufficient for conclusions to be reached. NHTSA is now planning to post new data on a monthly basis on its website [NHTSA 2022b]. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board in a May 2022 letter to NHTSA on a proposed revamp of the U.S. New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) called on NHTSA to add more emerging technologies to the NCAP program and noted that several technologies proposed to be included in NHTSA’s 10-year road map for future steps are currently available [NTSB a]. 5-12Transportation Statistics Annual Report 2023 to 12,937 in the first pandemic year in 2020 fatalities in 2021, 20 passengers (12 on transit and increasing a bit to 13,191 in the second rail, 8 on bus) and 3 vehicle operators, together pandemic year 2021 (Table 5-2).

These devices are deemed by some transportation planners as a solution to the “last mile problem,” making it easier for people to get to and from their homes to transit stations and to their ultimate destinations. Speed is an issue as riders on some of these mobility devices can cruise at 15 miles per hour or even faster—a speed too fast for most pedal bicyclists to maintain, too slow for highways, and too fast for sidewalks. Rider safety, and to some extent pedestrian safety, are a concern as rental opportunities for these devices have proliferated. Some users don’t wear helmets and training even for first time users is often limited to tutorials presented on the app used to rent the device. Sidewalk and road maintenance is also an issue, as riders can be bumped off by cracks and other imperfections in the sidewalk or potholes. Scooters and other devices left on sidewalks can also be a tripping hazard for pedestrians, especially the elderly and vision impaired. Data on injuries from these fast-growing transportation options are limited. A study by the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission (US CPSC) examined injury, fatality, and hazard patterns covering e-scooters, e-bikes, and hoverboards from 2017 through 2022. It found 360,000 emergency room visits by injured riders of these devices over the 5 years, with the number of visits increasing linearly each year. The number of fatalities increased from 5 in 2017 to 76 in 2022, with deaths totaling 233 over this period. CPSC conducted and completed follow up on 309 e-scooter visits to emergency departments, finding that renters comprised 37 percent of the visits; 63 percent of injuries were on paved roads, and only 13 percent of those interviewed were wearing a helmet [US CPSC a]. Micromobility mishaps often go unreported to police unless a motor vehicle is involved. Riders often go to hospital emergency rooms for treatment of their injuries if they fall or run into something, but many hospitals do not separately keep data on scooter injuries. Some cities with widespread scooter use, such as Austin, TX, are collecting data, but coverage is spotty. As more e-scooters and other kinds of personal or micromobility devices appear on sidewalks, streets, and other public ways, complete data about safety risks will be crucial to developing strategies to reduce injuries. Defective micromobility devices themselves are a hazard. In December 2022, CPSC issued a warning to manufacturers of dangers of overheating and fires from batteries of micromobility devices. The agency noted that it had received reports of 19 fatalities in 208 incidents from micromobility device overheating/fires, as well as numerous reports from emergency rooms of injuries, between the beginning of 2021 and the end of November 2022 [US CPSC b].

Additionally, DOT-117s have a skin that holds the insulation and thermal protection in place and doubles as additional protection from punctures. The tank cars have protected top fittings, a fully protected head shield, and a bottom outlet valve with an enhanced handle designed to prevent the tank car from emptying its contents in an incident. All the enhancements are designed to protect the tank from being punctured and to prevent the valves from being disrupted. DOT-117R tank cars are cars that have been retrofitted to meet the 117 specifications. 23 Title Ⅲ of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018, Pub.

The largest spill in U.S. waters began on Apr. 20, 2010, with an explosion and fire on the mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) Deepwater Horizon. Subsequently, the MODU sank, leaving an open exploratory well to discharge crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico for several weeks. The commonly accepted spill amount from the well is approximately 206.6 million gallons, plus approximately 400,000 gallons of oil products from the MODU.

Now the Evidence Act is creating new demands for data to support continuous improvements to public investments and regulations with learning agendas that combine traditional planning statistics with data on program implementation and outputs. As “plan- and-done” becomes “plan-implement-learn-do better,” statistics are no longer a static input to forecasts that are used for plans and shelved; statistics are now a key part of continuous learning and decision making. The COVID-19 pandemic encouraged the evolution of BTS from a focus on annual statistics published through printed reports to a focus on monthly and weekly statistics continuously updated on the web. The evolution of BTS continues under encouragement by the Evidence Act and the Section 25003 study to focus on decisions hindered by lack of available data as a basis for identifying data relevance and needs. Throughout its history, BTS has worked with its partners to create increasingly robust, timely, and credible products in each of the topic areas identified in legislative mandates and in goals of the Department of Transportation. BTS and its partners across the department endeavor to produce statistics that are relevant and useful throughout the Nation and to fulfill Abraham Lincoln’s vision that: “Statistics will save us from doing what we do, in wrong places” [Lincoln 1848]. 7-10Transportation Statistics Annual Report 2023 References —2023d.

In 2022, the flow of barges along the Mississippi River was hampered by reduced water levels caused by what is termed a “flash drought.” This unusual weather phenomenon, which had previously occurred mainly over the Missouri and Ohio tributaries, now centered itself over the Central United States, affecting the Mississippi River. The flash drought led to increased soil absorption of water and heightened water evaporation, consequently diminishing water levels along the Mississippi River, particularly between Cairo, Illinois and Memphis, Tennessee. B. 2021 As reported in TSAR 2022, these lower river draft conditions prevented barge fleets from operating at full capacity, resulting in a significant surge in barge freight rates. Prices skyrocketed from approximately $11–$12 per ton during the summer of 2022 to over $71 per ton in October 2022.6 This sudden cost increase prompted some modal shifts, with businesses turning to rail and trucking options. Low water levels became a recurring issue in 2023. While grain shippers and barge operators adapted by reducing barge capacity to prevent barges from becoming stranded, this practice of light-loading caused a further tightening of the barge supply, ultimately leading to even NOTE: Percentages do not sum to 100 due to rounding. higher freight rates.

        "Chapter 5—Transportation Safety Box 5-C Micromobility Safety and Shared Travelways Before the pandemic, the number of bikeshare and e-scooter systems reached almost 300, serving more than 200 cities, but many suspended operations at least temporarily in 2020. These devices are deemed by some transportation planners as a solution to the “last mile problem,” making it easier for people to get to and from their homes to transit stations and to their ultimate destinations. Speed is an issue as riders on some of these mobility devices can cruise at 15 miles per hour or even faster—a speed too fast for most pedal bicyclists to maintain, too slow for highways, and too fast for sidewalks. Rider safety, and to some extent pedestrian safety, are a concern as rental opportunities for these devices have proliferated. Some users don’t wear helmets and training even for first time users is often limited to tutorials presented on the app used to rent the device. Sidewalk and road maintenance is also an issue, as riders can be bumped off by cracks and other imperfections in the sidewalk or potholes. Scooters and other devices left on sidewalks can also be a tripping hazard for pedestrians, especially the elderly and vision impaired. Data on injuries from these fast-growing transportation options are limited. A study by the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission (US CPSC) examined injury, fatality, and hazard patterns covering e-scooters, e-bikes, and hoverboards from 2017 through 2022. It found 360,000 emergency room visits by injured riders of these devices over the 5 years, with the number of visits increasing linearly each year. The number of fatalities increased from 5 in 2017 to 76 in 2022, with deaths totaling 233 over this period. CPSC conducted and completed follow up on 309 e-scooter visits to emergency departments, finding that renters comprised 37 percent of the visits; 63 percent of injuries were on paved roads, and only 13 percent of those interviewed were wearing a helmet [US CPSC a]. Micromobility mishaps often go unreported to police unless a motor vehicle is involved. Riders often go to hospital emergency rooms for treatment of their injuries if they fall or run into something, but many hospitals do not separately keep data on scooter injuries. Some cities with widespread scooter use, such as Austin, TX, are collecting data, but coverage is spotty. As more e-scooters and other kinds of personal or micromobility devices appear on sidewalks, streets, and other public ways, complete data about safety risks will be crucial to developing strategies to reduce injuries. Defective micromobility devices themselves are a hazard. In December 2022, CPSC issued a warning to manufacturers of dangers of overheating and fires from batteries of micromobility devices. The agency noted that it had received reports of 19 fatalities in 208 incidents from micromobility device overheating/fires, as well as numerous reports from emergency rooms of injuries, between the beginning of 2021 and the end of November 2022 [US CPSC b].

        "Chapter 6—Energy and Sustainability Box 6-A Electric Vehicle Definitions Battery electric vehicle (BEV): An all-electric vehicle that receives power by plugging into an electric power source and storing the power in a battery pack. BEVs do not use any petroleum-based or other liquid- or gas- based fuel during operation and do not produce tailpipe emissions. Fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV): An electric vehicle that generates on-board electricity with a fuel cell powered by hydrogen rather than relying on electricity from a high-capacity battery. Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV): Combines an internal combustion engine (ICE) with a battery pack, regenerative braking, and an electric motor to provide high fuel economy. HEVs rely on gasoline or diesel fuel for power and cannot be plugged into an electric power source. The battery packs are charged by the ICE and regenerative braking. PEV/Electric vehicle (EV): A general term for any on-road licensed vehicle that can plug into an electric power source and uses electric power to move. EVs plug into a source of electricity and store power in a battery pack for all or part of their power needs. Includes Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles (PHEVs). Can also be referred to as Plug-in Electric Vehicles. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV): A vehicle that can both (1) plug into an electric power source and store power in a battery pack and (2) use petroleum-based or other liquid- or gas-based fuel to power an internal combustion engine.
