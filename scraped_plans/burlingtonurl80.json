Greenhouse gas emissions from excessive use of fossil fuels are changing the Earth’s atmosphere and dangerously warming the planet. In addition, Milwaukee has pronounced historical racial disparities that could be exacerbated by climate change. All Milwaukeeans will be affected by climate change, and low-income communities face environmental hazards at a higher rate. In the face of these threats, Milwaukee will support a new clean energy economy that provides new opportunities for people of color to more fully and equitably participate in the economic life of Milwaukee.

City of Milwaukee - Climate and Equity Plan 5Milwaukee is a city built on the spirit of innovation, resilience, and progress. We believe in creating a community where every person can thrive, where opportunities are within reach, and where no one is left behind. We do not back down in the face of adversity. We continue to move forward, building on our heritage and learning from our past, to ensure Milwaukee shines as a beacon of hope, inclusivity, and boundless potential for generations to come. A rapidly warming planet and changing climate present a new set of challenges for Milwaukee. How we respond to these challenges will shape the future of our city. Through a focus on attracting family-supporting green jobs of the future, creating resilient neighborhoods and modern transportation networks – as well as ensuring our city uplifts those who bear the brunt of the impacts of climate change – my administration is committed to addressing this crisis in a way that promotes growth. We must be clear-eyed about the damage climate change is creating, and will continue to create, in Milwaukee. Industry that put Milwaukee on the map has polluted our land and overheated our planet, threatening our city with more frequent flooding and extreme heat. The car-centric transportation system of the last century has devastated many neighborhoods, from Borchert Field to Bronzeville. Prolonged disinvestment has left many of our homes poorly positioned to shield families from extreme weather events. All of these impacts have been felt most severely by our residents of color. As we look ahead to the Milwaukee of the future, we must seize the opportunity to address these wrongs. Our response to these challenges is an important part of my vision to grow Milwaukee’s economy and population to one million people. We are the economic engine of our state, and through an equity-driven approach to the changing climate, we can keep Milwaukee as a hub for the jobs of the future and the best place in the country to raise a family. I am proud to present Milwaukee’s Climate and Equity Plan and its 10 Big Ideas. The plan is the result of over three years of community engagement and recommendations from both residents and leaders in my administration. Milwaukee responds to challenges, and we will work tirelessly to ensure our city is ready for the future. Sincerely, Cavalier Johnson Mayor 6 City of Milwaukee - Climate and Equity PlanEXECUTIVE SUMMARY Chapter 1 CLIMATE CRISIS T he Climate and Equity Plan provides the vision and foundation for climate action in Milwaukee. The Plan will help accelerate existing climate action in Milwaukee and inform development of new initiatives, all with racial and economic equity in mind. The plan is the direct outgrowth of over three years of public discussions and planning through the City-County Taskforce on Climate and Economic Equity (CC Files 190445 & 191923 ). The plan has two primary objectives: 1. 2. Reduce community Improve racial and greenhouse gas emissions economic equity by creating green jobs that pay 45% by 2030 $40,000 achieve net zero focusing recruitment on emissions by 2050 people of color To achieve these goals, this plan outlines 10 Big Ideas for Action. These strategies can be achieved in collaboration among government agencies, businesses, community-based organizations and other partners. The plan is intended to be financed primarily from new federal resources including the Inflation Reduction Act.

Yet, Milwaukee has unacceptable racial after study are harming communities now and will disparities in every economic category including get worse in the future without major action. The employment, income, homeownership, and energy scientific consensus is clear: the global climate is burden. Milwaukee is an older industrial city that changing, human activity is the primary contributor, is working to recover from historical practices that and society needs to dramatically reduce fossil fuel resulted in a range of environmental problems, use to avoid catastrophe. including old homes with poor insulation, lead paint and lead pipes, polluted soil, and other challenges. Deindustrialization, outsourcing, inequitable recruitment and hiring practices, and numerous other effects of racism have resulted in economic conditions similar to those seen during the Great Depression for minority and disadvantaged communities in Milwaukee. As recently as 2019, the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee researchers found that in the 53206 ZIP code only approximately 50% of working-age adults were employed, more than 20% of employed residents had incomes below the federal poverty level, and the area had an overall poverty level of 42%. 1 Image of Milwaukee flooding in 2010. In the last five years alone, reports from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United States Global Change Research Program, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts, and countless other reputable entities have all contributed key findings that the planet’s climate is drastically changing due primarily to human activity. Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have dramatically increased the burning of fossil fuels like coal, petroleum, and Lead paint chipping from a window. natural gas.

The City of Milwaukee’s own financial constraints also make widespread environmental restoration difficult without support from state, federal, and other partners. Climate change will worsen these inequities and disproportionately impact underserved communities. Environmental justice means that the City and its collaborative partners work to create jobs and improve the environment for residents that have been historically left behind.

For example, making buildings substantially more energy efficient will require more energy efficiency technicians, which are jobs that pay a decent wage and cannot be outsourced. Improving public transit to increase adoption can reduce community greenhouse gas emissions while connecting more people to family-supporting jobs. Such improvements to the public transit system would also benefit under-served community members who rely more heavily on public transit.

Task Force members and citizens chaired subject area work groups consisting of Milwaukee residents and representatives from environmental groups, local government, non-profit organizations, and businesses. These working groups developed a Preliminary Report in March of 2020, which can be found at milwaukee. gov/climateplan under “Planning Process.” Nine work groups then met throughout 2021 to develop initial recommendations for implementation beginning in 2023. Each work group developed one or more proposals for a specific sector, including jobs, transportation, buildings, the energy grid, land use, waste management, and resiliency. All of the working groups understand and accept the fiscal constraints of the City; however, they were instructed to “think big” to position Milwaukee for federal grants and other funding opportunities that are now available to meet the goals established by the Common Council and County Board. Working groups finalized their proposals, the 10 Big Ideas, that now form the foundation for the Climate and Equity Plan. 1. Green Jobs Accelerator 2. Healthy Home Energy Upgrades 3.

LEADING BY EXAMPLE To meet its equity goals while also helping to fill its own vacant positions, Milwaukee Water Works formed the Water Equity Action Team through its partnership with the U.S. Water Alliance. The team forecasts available jobs in the industry and works to recruit a more diverse workforce. It has hosted three water-focused job fairs targeting under-represented communities. Water Works’ effort to train, recruit, hire, and promote a more diverse workforce is succeeding because of its partnerships with key water sector leaders like Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Milwaukee Water Commons, Veola, and other water sector businesses, water-focused higher education institutions, workforce development partners, advocates, allies and friends. Partners organized the One Water Career Fair inviting the public to learn about and apply for jobs in the water sector. Water Works messages that if interested candidates have any kind of skills, or no skills, it wants to hire them and train them. With the support of a $2 million federal grant, Milwaukee Water Works is partnering with Employ Milwaukee on the Fresh Coast, Fresh Opportunities Initiative to provide a diverse pipeline of talent for water utilities and contractors that support lead service line replacements. 500 underrepresented youth will receive career exploration services and an additional 500 underrepresented job seekers will receive employment and training services. The project will build a more equitable workforce and address the critical need to increase the awareness of quality water utility jobs, especially in the plumbing and construction trades. As a result of this work, Milwaukee Water Works hopes to see more diversity in water utility related jobs, and more wealth and long-term economic prosperity in underserved communities. The process to support equity in water jobs can be applied to green jobs like electricians and related trades. City of Milwaukee - Climate and Equity Plan 41Local Training Providers Milwaukee already has a number of green jobs training programs that could be more effectively coordinated through the accelerator: • Trade unions like the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers provide training, family- supporting wages, and benefits • Milwaukee Area Technical College is a pathway to many trades and green jobs, particularly building automation and controls.

LEADING BY EXAMPLE This program is an outgrowth of the Business Case developed for the Bloomberg Philanthropies Global Mayors Challenge and the City-County Task Force on Climate and Economic Equity. Major milestones to date include: • In 2021, ECO presented the project to the U.S. Department of Energy and Advanced Building Construction Collaborative powered by the Rocky Mountain Institute. • Next, ECO worked with University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Architecture and Urban Planning students to develop concepts. • Then, ECO issued a Request for Information to firms nationally to gauge interest and get feedback on the program idea. The City received interest from seven national manufacturers and innovation teams interested in establishing a factory in Milwaukee through this partnership. The envisioned public-private partnership would combine private sector manufacturing expertise with public financial support in developing a pipeline of new housing orders, workforce development, and design and permitting. • In addition, ECO received a $25,000 EPA grant to develop a demand-side financing strategy for residents to purchase houses built from the net-zero housing factory. • Finally, $1 million in ARPA dollars has been allocated to the project. City of Milwaukee - Climate and Equity Plan 55Milwaukee’s participation in the national Advanced Net-Zero Energy Housing Project Building Construction Collaborative informed the Flow Chart development of this project. ECO worked with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, a technical assistance provider of the Better Buildings Workforce Gap Financing from Accelerator, to create a Preliminary Workforce New Markets Tax Credits, Development Plan for this project under a technical Inflation Reduction Act services agreement paid for by the U.S. Department tax credits, and other sources of Energy. The preliminary plan recommended Training for Manufactured Housing Construction (TRAMCON) as a possible model that has been successful in other states.

LEADING BY EXAMPLE Since 2012, the City of Milwaukee has championed the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Building Challenge with the goal of improving energy efficiency of commercial, public, industrial, and residential buildings by at least 20% over ten years. The initiative features the participation of 133 buildings in the city. The City of Milwaukee’s commitment to improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings was recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy as a model for other communities. In Milwaukee, the Better Building Challenge established a voluntary benchmarking program that provided free energy assessments and offered Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Financing. Over $40 million of energy efficiency projects have been financed through the City by leveraging private capital. Also through this program, the City of Milwaukee provided training, technology transfer, and workforce development with the help of local organizations such as the Milwaukee Area Technical College.The City leads by example through a focus on energy efficiency in municipal facilities, including major energy efficiency projects at Milwaukee Public Library locations and fire stations.

Advocacy should be ongoing to ensure Wisconsin is a leader in centering energy efficiency in the building code. The City is also supportive of the recently reconstituted Wisconsin Advisory Council on Building Sustainability to inform changes to the building code.

The focus of this section is to reduce VMT, which Reduced access to jobs, schools, healthcare, and predominantly focuses on reducing the number and services has further exacerbated structural inequities. duration of passenger-vehicle trips. Inequitable access to transportation options results from a legacy of discriminatory housing, land-use, and transportation policies. The $750-$1,000 per capita that Wisconsin spends on roads and highways each year has made congestion worse while increasing air pollution, displacing communities of color, and destroying beneficial green spaces. In Wisconsin, low-income and communities of color are both the most dependent on transit services while also being exposed to higher- than-average air pollution from particulate matter, with pollution from transportation and industry as the most harmful source of those disparities. The Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC) reports 13% of low-income households in Milwaukee use public transportation to get to work versus 5% of higher earners. 13% of Black residents rely on public transportation to get to work, versus 3% of White individuals.

Prioritize Active Modes of Walking project. and Biking Multiple studies have illustrated that walking and biking can make a measurable difference in reducing VMT. Results from a 2017 National Household Travel Survey demonstrate that it is possible to shift many short trips taken by car to walking or biking. According to the survey, 53% of all trips are within 3 miles or less, and 28% of all trips are within 1 mile or less. 3 miles is equivalent to a 20-minute bike ride for the average adult, and 1 mile is equivalent to a 20-minute walk for the average adult. Access to safe, active modes of transportation is particularly important to low-income and minority households; these populations take 50% more walk trips than higher income individuals and have the greatest rate of bike trips, often using bikes to access employment. In addition to being more environmentally-friendly, infrastructure for active modes of transportation is less costly to build and maintain, supports local business development, and creates more green jobs.40 Specific, short-term recommendations include: • Install protected bike lanes through downtown to connect the Oak Leaf Trail, Hank Aaron State Example of possible design changes to prioritize safer walking.

LEADING BY EXAMPLE Quality Improvement Program to expand EVs in the fleet and build-out charging infrastructure. The City of Milwaukee has begun the process of Moreover, DPW-Parking is looking for ways to transitioning its municipal fleet from traditional make its EV chargers accessible to City employees internal combustion engine vehicles to those and members of the public through a smart phone powered by alternative fuels, EVs, or hybrids. The application. In 2022, the City began to develop, Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), with the help communicate, and implement a clear policy of ECO, purchased 10 hybrid Police Interceptors specifying considerations for vehicle and fleet to pilot in 2020. The vehicles have increased miles purchase, lease, and other acquisition. Adopted in per gallon over 50% and reduce emissions per mile 2023, the policy puts the City on a path to convert 35%.

The price of EVs is another factor that contributes to the disparities in adoption rates. Estimates have been made that the price parity between internal combustion engine vehicles and EVs may occur in or around 2025.50 The Inflation Reduction Act will help make EVs more affordable for middle- to lower-middle class consumers by providing incentives of $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used vehicles. As upfront costs fall and inventory of used EVs grows, more equitable access can be expected. Increasing EV adoption rates in Milwaukee will present challenges, but also significant opportunities for green job growth. Resilience According to Clean Jobs Midwest, the Milwaukee Metropolitan area has a total of 18,574 clean energy jobs and Wisconsin as a whole has 69,343.51 Advanced transportation jobs within this workforce account for 7% of the total, suggesting that the state has a solid track record of clean energy employment with room for transportation-specific clean energy jobs to grow.

Overproduction of food, packaging, and disposable goods represents results in the loss of natural resources and money, especially loss of energy and water resources used to produce them. Single-use plastic bags and food packaging often become litter in the City’s streets and rivers. Over time, the health of both our society and ecosystems have suffered due to accumulation of waste materials. Once sent to a landfill, organic waste such as food scraps decompose to release methane, a highly potent Equity greenhouse gas.

City of Milwaukee - Climate and Equity Plan 99Food Recovery Hierarchy The EPA’s Food Recovery Hierarchy prioritizes the avenues for food waste reduction. Collectively, these uses form an order for the preferred ways to deal with excess food and food waste. At the top of the hierarchy is source reduction, or reducing the amount of extra food being generated, which is difficult for local governments to address given that food production happens primarily in the private sector supported by state and federal policy. Feeding hungry people is something that local governments do have some control over. The least preferred method of dealing with food waste is sending it to a landfill. If source reduction is not possible, and food waste cannot be used to feed people, food waste can be used to feed animals or for industrial Photo Credit: EPA uses. Composting is another potential avenue for food waste. Composting converts organic material, including food scraps, yard waste, and more, into a usable soil amendment that can be used to grow new food and other plants. Composting is a sustainable way to recycle the nutrients from food and is preferred to sending organic waste to the landfill. City Strategy Food Excess Equitable Distribution (FEED) MKE is a conceptual public-private partnership with the mission to reduce food waste sent to landfills. The collaborative effort can be initiated by the City, County, and/or UW Extension Milwaukee County. FEED MKE prioritizes source reduction and feeding Young person looking at vegetables. hungry people, the preferred uses listed in EPA’s Food Recovery Hierarchy.

The collaboration will also address legal 100 City of Milwaukee - Climate and Equity Planand policy issues, like removing barriers to food Fresh produce. donation and improving food labeling. In addition, FEED MKE will include public outreach to educate businesses and consumers on the issue. Building Partnerships The FEED MKE collaboration will build upon existing organizations and programs to further reduce or prevent food waste, recover or rescue surplus food, and feed hungry people. In addition, partnerships should establish and support local, distributed growing operations to empower individuals and groups to engage in sustainable food production. When food is grown on-site, people are less dependent on disruptions to the global food system. One example to consider is Fork Farms’ scalable hydroponic technology. Another example is supporting subscription-based services such as Imperfect Foods. The City, County, and/or UW Extension Milwaukee County should explore initiating FEED MKE by convening businesses, non-profits, philanthropies, governmental agencies, and interested citizens. A Food Waste/Food Security Summit could kick off the collaboration across the following agencies: • Gleaning Milwaukee Coalition • Hunger Task Force • Feeding America • Anti-poverty agencies like Community Advocates and the Social Development Commission • Philanthropies interested in promoting food justice • Universities with student or teaching resources/ personnel Operations and Measurement During an approximately two-year organizing period, the structure and operations of the collaboration must be defined. The quickest way to ramp up food recovery is to fund a full-time staff person or contractor with one of the partner organizations. The Gleaning Milwaukee Coalition aspires to redistribute food from new sources such as businesses and institutions that are not currently involved with food rescue and distribution. The Coalition currently has City of Milwaukee - Climate and Equity Plan 101volunteers, but no staff. Staff should operate under the guidance of a board or steering committee. The creation of neighborhood food hubs may also be a useful model to explore. See the Recipe for Success graphic for an example of food hubs in Milan, Italy. FEED MKE will offer programs that make the most of existing knowledge, capabilities, and assets from non- profits, businesses, and government. New tools and resources may be created to complement or expand existing programs. Identifiable Quantitative Outputs FEED MKE’s key output is a reduction in solid waste sent to landfills. A 20% reduction in solid waste generated by 2025 and a 25% reduction by 2030 would have multiple benefits, including Graphic by GRAEF. cost savings for tipping fees at landfills along with reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

The Fund has offered grant support for two years. • Identifying lessons learned by municipalities currently working with Natural Resources Defense Council and participating in Save the Food efforts. Funding Sources Making FEED MKE operational will require resources and funding. Multiple U.S. municipalities have launched Save the Food programs, which can be referenced for ideas on resourcing. The following list includes options for available funding for planning/ program development and implementation of the collaborative: • The City should continue its annual budget allocation of $100,000 for Fresh Food Access and use all or a portion to fund FEED MKE. Community Development Grants through the City or County could also be used. • Milwaukee County’s allocation of federal funds (e.g., ARPA, CARES, Infrastructure) could be accessed for this purpose. • USDA and EPA grants are available when units of government are the applicants. Funding should include paid participation by collaborators. • The State of Wisconsin could fund FEED MKE as the pilot food waste project recommended in the Governor’s Climate Change Report. • NRDC, ReFED, and other non-profits have staff that can be consulted and resources that can be distributed to Milwaukee.

Embodied Carbon in the Transportation Sector: Concrete Climate Ideas from Girl Scouts, Troops 1477 and 1953 You may be surprised to know that the asphalt that gives our roads life, the steel that gives our bridges height, and the concrete that boosts our sidewalks can be hiding a devious contributor to climate change known as embodied carbon. It refers to the greenhouse gas emissions that stem from the manufacturing, transportation, installation, maintenance, and disposal of the materials used to build our transportation networks and our buildings. This differs from what we commonly understand as operational carbon, or the greenhouse gasses we produce directly when using electricity or driving a vehicle. Embodied carbon is somewhat hidden from mainstream view, but it’s no less important in our mission to reduce emissions. The bad news: there’s a lot of embodied carbon in our landscape. Estimates from the MIT Sustainability Hub Report find that concrete alone generates as much as 8% of global emissions.72 Now time for the good news: there are many ways to reduce the amount of embodied carbon from construction materials. MIT Climate Portal reports some varieties of low-carbon concrete can use new recipes for cement, an important ingredient in concrete, that emit around 10% less in carbon dioxide.

Walnut Way Conservation Corporation has been a leading environmental justice organization working to improve Lindsay Heights while employing people from the neighborhood. Teaming up with ECO and the Institute for Sustainable Communities, Walnut Way helped Lindsay Heights earn Milwaukee’s first ECO-Neighborhood designation through collective work on Fondy Park and other area pocket parks and orchards, which included building green stormwater infrastructure. The partnership also brought about Milwaukee’s first resilience hub at the Wellness Commons. Sherman Park has become Milwaukee’s second ECO Neighborhood through leadership by the Sherman Park Community Association, residents, and local churches that have coordinated beautification and education activities with ECO, Milwaukee Water Commons, and other local agencies focused on environmental sustainability.

Greenhouse gas emissions from excessive use of fossil fuels are changing the Earth’s atmosphere and dangerously warming the planet. In addition, Milwaukee has pronounced historical racial disparities that could be exacerbated by climate change. All Milwaukeeans will be affected by climate change, and low-income communities face environmental hazards at a higher rate. In the face of these threats, Milwaukee will support a new clean energy economy that provides new opportunities for people of color to more fully and equitably participate in the economic life of Milwaukee.

        "Milwaukee is a city built on the spirit of innovation, resilience, and progress. We believe in creating a community where every person can thrive, where opportunities are within reach, and where no one is left behind. We do not back down in the face of adversity. We continue to move forward, building on our heritage and learning from our past, to ensure Milwaukee shines as a beacon of hope, inclusivity, and boundless potential for generations to come. A rapidly warming planet and changing climate present a new set of challenges for Milwaukee. How we respond to these challenges will shape the future of our city. Through a focus on attracting family-supporting green jobs of the future, creating resilient neighborhoods and modern transportation networks – as well as ensuring our city uplifts those who bear the brunt of the impacts of climate change – my administration is committed to addressing this crisis in a way that promotes growth. We must be clear-eyed about the damage climate change is creating, and will continue to create, in Milwaukee. Industry that put Milwaukee on the map has polluted our land and overheated our planet, threatening our city with more frequent flooding and extreme heat. The car-centric transportation system of the last century has devastated many neighborhoods, from Borchert Field to Bronzeville. Prolonged disinvestment has left many of our homes poorly positioned to shield families from extreme weather events. All of these impacts have been felt most severely by our residents of color. As we look ahead to the Milwaukee of the future, we must seize the opportunity to address these wrongs. Our response to these challenges is an important part of my vision to grow Milwaukee’s economy and population to one million people. We are the economic engine of our state, and through an equity-driven approach to the changing climate, we can keep Milwaukee as a hub for the jobs of the future and the best place in the country to raise a family. I am proud to present Milwaukee’s Climate and Equity Plan and its 10 Big Ideas. The plan is the result of over three years of community engagement and recommendations from both residents and leaders in my administration. Milwaukee responds to challenges, and we will work tirelessly to ensure our city is ready for the future. Sincerely, Cavalier Johnson Mayor 6 City of Milwaukee - Climate and Equity Plan",
        "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Chapter 1 CLIMATE CRISIS T he Climate and Equity Plan provides the vision and foundation for climate action in Milwaukee. The Plan will help accelerate existing climate action in Milwaukee and inform development of new initiatives, all with racial and economic equity in mind. The plan is the direct outgrowth of over three years of public discussions and planning through the City-County Taskforce on Climate and Economic Equity (CC Files 190445 & 191923 ). The plan has two primary objectives: 1. 2. Reduce community Improve racial and greenhouse gas emissions economic equity by creating green jobs that pay 45% by 2030 $40,000 achieve net zero focusing recruitment on emissions by 2050 people of color To achieve these goals, this plan outlines 10 Big Ideas for Action. These strategies can be achieved in collaboration among government agencies, businesses, community-based organizations and other partners.

Deindustrialization, outsourcing, inequitable recruitment and hiring practices, and numerous other effects of racism have resulted in economic conditions similar to those seen during the Great Depression for minority and disadvantaged communities in Milwaukee. As recently as 2019, the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee researchers found that in the 53206 ZIP code only approximately 50% of working-age adults were employed, more than 20% of employed residents had incomes below the federal poverty level, and the area had an overall poverty level of 42%. 1 Image of Milwaukee flooding in 2010. In the last five years alone, reports from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United States Global Change Research Program, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts, and countless other reputable entities have all contributed key findings that the planet’s climate is drastically changing due primarily to human activity.

The team forecasts available jobs in the industry and works to recruit a more diverse workforce. It has hosted three water-focused job fairs targeting under-represented communities. Water Works’ effort to train, recruit, hire, and promote a more diverse workforce is succeeding because of its partnerships with key water sector leaders like Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Milwaukee Water Commons, Veola, and other water sector businesses, water-focused higher education institutions, workforce development partners, advocates, allies and friends. Partners organized the One Water Career Fair inviting the public to learn about and apply for jobs in the water sector. Water Works messages that if interested candidates have any kind of skills, or no skills, it wants to hire them and train them. With the support of a $2 million federal grant, Milwaukee Water Works is partnering with Employ Milwaukee on the Fresh Coast, Fresh Opportunities Initiative to provide a diverse pipeline of talent for water utilities and contractors that support lead service line replacements. 500 underrepresented youth will receive career exploration services and an additional 500 underrepresented job seekers will receive employment and training services. The project will build a more equitable workforce and address the critical need to increase the awareness of quality water utility jobs, especially in the plumbing and construction trades. As a result of this work, Milwaukee Water Works hopes to see more diversity in water utility related jobs, and more wealth and long-term economic prosperity in underserved communities.

The City received interest from seven national manufacturers and innovation teams interested in establishing a factory in Milwaukee through this partnership. The envisioned public-private partnership would combine private sector manufacturing expertise with public financial support in developing a pipeline of new housing orders, workforce development, and design and permitting. • In addition, ECO received a $25,000 EPA grant to develop a demand-side financing strategy for residents to purchase houses built from the net-zero housing factory. • Finally, $1 million in ARPA dollars has been allocated to the project.

Access to safe, active modes of transportation is particularly important to low-income and minority households; these populations take 50% more walk trips than higher income individuals and have the greatest rate of bike trips, often using bikes to access employment. In addition to being more environmentally-friendly, infrastructure for active modes of transportation is less costly to build and maintain, supports local business development, and creates more green jobs.40 Specific, short-term recommendations include: • Install protected bike lanes through downtown to connect the Oak Leaf Trail, Hank Aaron State Example of possible design changes to prioritize safer walking.

        "Food Recovery Hierarchy The EPA’s Food Recovery Hierarchy prioritizes the avenues for food waste reduction. Collectively, these uses form an order for the preferred ways to deal with excess food and food waste. At the top of the hierarchy is source reduction, or reducing the amount of extra food being generated, which is difficult for local governments to address given that food production happens primarily in the private sector supported by state and federal policy. Feeding hungry people is something that local governments do have some control over. The least preferred method of dealing with food waste is sending it to a landfill. If source reduction is not possible, and food waste cannot be used to feed people, food waste can be used to feed animals or for industrial Photo Credit: EPA uses. Composting is another potential avenue for food waste. Composting converts organic material, including food scraps, yard waste, and more, into a usable soil amendment that can be used to grow new food and other plants. Composting is a sustainable way to recycle the nutrients from food and is preferred to sending organic waste to the landfill.

In addition, FEED MKE will include public outreach to educate businesses and consumers on the issue. Building Partnerships The FEED MKE collaboration will build upon existing organizations and programs to further reduce or prevent food waste, recover or rescue surplus food, and feed hungry people. In addition, partnerships should establish and support local, distributed growing operations to empower individuals and groups to engage in sustainable food production. When food is grown on-site, people are less dependent on disruptions to the global food system. One example to consider is Fork Farms’ scalable hydroponic technology. Another example is supporting subscription-based services such as Imperfect Foods. The City, County, and/or UW Extension Milwaukee County should explore initiating FEED MKE by convening businesses, non-profits, philanthropies, governmental agencies, and interested citizens. A Food Waste/Food Security Summit could kick off the collaboration across the following agencies: • Gleaning Milwaukee Coalition • Hunger Task Force • Feeding America • Anti-poverty agencies like Community Advocates and the Social Development Commission • Philanthropies interested in promoting food justice • Universities with student or teaching resources/ personnel Operations and Measurement During an approximately two-year organizing period, the structure and operations of the collaboration must be defined. The quickest way to ramp up food recovery is to fund a full-time staff person or contractor with one of the partner organizations.

Community Development Grants through the City or County could also be used. • Milwaukee County’s allocation of federal funds (e.g., ARPA, CARES, Infrastructure) could be accessed for this purpose. • USDA and EPA grants are available when units of government are the applicants. Funding should include paid participation by collaborators. • The State of Wisconsin could fund FEED MKE as the pilot food waste project recommended in the Governor’s Climate Change Report. • NRDC, ReFED, and other non-profits have staff that can be consulted and resources that can be distributed to Milwaukee.

Embodied Carbon in the Transportation Sector: Concrete Climate Ideas from Girl Scouts, Troops 1477 and 1953 You may be surprised to know that the asphalt that gives our roads life, the steel that gives our bridges height, and the concrete that boosts our sidewalks can be hiding a devious contributor to climate change known as embodied carbon. It refers to the greenhouse gas emissions that stem from the manufacturing, transportation, installation, maintenance, and disposal of the materials used to build our transportation networks and our buildings. This differs from what we commonly understand as operational carbon, or the greenhouse gasses we produce directly when using electricity or driving a vehicle. Embodied carbon is somewhat hidden from mainstream view, but it’s no less important in our mission to reduce emissions. The bad news: there’s a lot of embodied carbon in our landscape. Estimates from the MIT Sustainability Hub Report find that concrete alone generates as much as 8% of global emissions.72 Now time for the good news: there are many ways to reduce the amount of embodied carbon from construction materials. MIT Climate Portal reports some varieties of low-carbon concrete can use new recipes for cement, an important ingredient in concrete, that emit around 10% less in carbon dioxide. In addition, industry is innovating new ways to capture carbon dioxide when making cement, or any other industrial process, that can be mineralized and become part of the finished concrete itself (in other words, permanently stored).73 Peer cities across the country are undertaking efforts to reduce embodied carbon. The City will test low-carbon concrete on a Public Works project and, if successful, the City will explore updating its purchasing ordinances for construction materials to potentially require Environmental Product Declarations.
