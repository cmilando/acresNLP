CURTATONE Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. It also presents a tremendous opportunity to think differently about how we plan and live in cities. By taking action to slow climate change and to prepare for its impacts, we can forge a better future for our children, make Somerville healthier and safer, stimulate the local economy by driving demand for local clean energy and transportation solutions, and make our community stronger and more resilient. In Somerville, we can lead by showing that bold transformations are possible. Climate change is a complex, collective action problem. But in Somerville, we don’t shy away from a challenge, we roll up our sleeves and find solutions. Somerville Climate Forward is full of solutions that will help us work collectively to become a carbon-neutral and resilient City. In true Somerville fashion, we used a data-driven approach to develop the actions in Somerville Climate Forward. This plan is the culmination of years of work to fully understand what climate change means here in Somerville. The Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment informed us of our most pressing needs to make our community more resilient to climate impacts; our greenhouse gas inventories tell us how we, as a community and city government, contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions and where we need to cut back the most; and the Pathways to Carbon Neutrality Study showed us what it would take to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Armed with this data, we were able to push our action planning further and prioritize a short list of actions that are detailed and implementable. Not all of the actions in this plan will be easy, but I know that Somerville is up to the challenge. Now more than ever, we need bold local solutions and transformational change that are only possible through collective action. Solving the problem of climate change will require transformations of our transportation, energy, and economic systems that have been driven by fossil fuels for generations. It is important for us all to find ways to reduce emissions every day, whether that is by choosing to take a bus instead of a car or using less energy at home. But government plays a critical role in facilitating the systems-level changes that make it easier for everyone to make more sustainable choices. Whether that is bringing the Green Line to Somerville to make it easier to forego a car or implementing the community choice electricity program to bring down the cost of renewable electricity. It is also vital that we do this equitably. Climate action cannot leave people behind. On both the global and local scale, those who have contributed least to climate change will be the most impacted and often have the fewest opportunities to benefit from climate action. If we are to succeed in our goals, everyone needs to be able to participate in climate action, not just those with the most resources. This is why we have identified equity considerations for each action in this plan, and will continue to look for ways to implement this plan so that it benefits everyone in our community and does not increase burdens on those in our community who are already struggling. This plan alone will not prevent global climate change, but if cities around the world take bold action to transform into carbon neutral and resilient cities, we can create a better future for all. Let’s be bold toggether and move Somerville forward. iiACKNOWLEDGEMENTS THIS PLAN IS THE RESULT OF THE HARD WORK AND COLLABORATION OF MANY.

Over the last year, respondents to the Somerville Climate Forward survey noted that they have observed longer and warmer summers in Somerville, as well as an increase in extreme weather, particularly intense rainstorms. Climate change will also present new impacts from sea level rise and storm surge along the Mystic River, which the City has not experienced in the past. Somerville’s Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment prompted The 2016 Greenhouse Gas inventory was the City to include actions that reduce climate Somerville’s first rigorous analysis of the change risks to the most vulnerable people, source of our climate-change causing infrastructure assets, and natural resources emissions. as part of this plan.

Presented in this report are: • VISION AND GOALS • THE 13 ACTION AREAS AND 22 PRIORITY ACTIONS • IMPLEMENTATION TIMEFRAME The priority action areas were selected based on their ability to solve a key issue identified by either the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment or the Pathways to Carbon Neutrality Study. The specific priority action was selected based on the impact it can have, the co-benefits it can provide, the feasibility of implementing it in Somerville, and by asking working groups, technical experts, City staff, and regional partners: what do we need to do to get started addressing this problem? The focus of this plan is to make a difference now. The actions are intended to be initiated within 5 years. Some of the actions will take longer to complete than others. In five years, the plan will be revisited in order to reassess priorities and identify new action areas. Collectively, the priority actions represent the most important next steps for Somerville to take in order to have the biggest impact on mitigating and preparing for climate change. 6INTRODUCTION YOU’RE PART OF THIS TOO!

Municipalities Act. The Charter has allowed the City to make by-laws regulating GHG emissions from buildings. Building on this authority, the City adopted the Zero Emissions Buildings Plan in 2016, which establishes GHG and thermal energy use limits by building type that eventually taper off to zero by a specific timeline. Further, the plan provides recommendations to enable compliance through leading by example, offering incentives for early adoption, and increasing capacity and knowledge about net-zero emissions buildings among industry professionals and the public. While Somerville does not have comparable authority, the Vancouver performance standards provide an example of enacted GHG performance standards.

Financing mechanisms to offset these costs are discussed on page 23. However, residents living in inclusionary units or new affordable housing would benefit if their buildings were net-zero emissions because their energy costs would likely be lower and less variable. The increased cost for affordable housing projects could be a challenge, and incentives to offset costs should be explored so affordable housing development is not stalled because of a net- zero policy. 20BUILDINGS BENEFITS 59% Qualitative co-benefits: • Requirements for net-zero buildings Portion of present significant opportunities for job creation in the building-scale energy efficiency and renewable energy fields.2 Somerville’s • These requirements also improve energy emissions in and water conservation and air quality due to potential elimination of on-site fossil fuel use. 2014 from Impact of action on GHG mitigation & building adaptation: • Net-zero buildings, when paired with energy use. energy storage solutions, can contribute to increased resilience in the face of extreme weather events, such as flooding and heat waves in Somerville.

The majority of Somerville residents are Somerville are renter-occupied, Somerville tracking. As described in the Precedents renters and have little to no control over the needs an approach that directly targets and section, the City of Boulder, CO has energy efficiency or energy systems in their benefits rental properties. The first step in successfully implemented a policy requiring home. Reducing emissions from rental creating any targeted rental program or rental properties to achieve a baseline energy properties is essential to achieving carbon policy is establishing a rental license program, efficiency standard. The policy was designed, neutrality, but the City of Somerville currently which creates the necessary tools to enforce in part, to help overcome the “split incentive” has no ability to regulate this. Establishing any rental energy requirement. An energy barrier in which renters do not invest in a rental licensing program will create the disclosure mandate would benefit tenants energy efficiency improvements to a property administrative infrastructure required to at the point of lease by informing them of they do not own and property owners do regulate rental units and to enable a rental the unit’s estimated energy costs. Such a not receive the financial benefit of efficiency energy disclosure requirement. disclosure would also hopefully encourage improvements through lower rental unit landlords to make upgrades in order to keep utility costs.

Furthermore, given that assistance and enforcement, and data approximately 65% of housing units in 33BUILDINGS Rental properties represent 64% of total residential units in the City, and influencing energy efficiency in existing rental buildings is an important objective to support Somerville’s carbon neutrality goal. The validity of the license period can be determined by understanding the rate of lease turnover in Somerville so as to enable effective enforcement of the disclosure requirement. The City would then define an appropriate mode of disclosure, which could be in the form of a public database, a private transaction in which the information is shared only among the property owner, tenants, and the City, or by other means. The disclosure process could be streamlined by working with the energy utilities such that the information can be requested in a streamlined fashioned, and delivered in a standardized format that contains enough detail to enable informed decision making (e.g., a breakdown of energy consumption by energy end uses as opposed to aggregated data on energy consumption). License inspectors and support staff would Existing rental properties in Somerville represent a significant opportunity for energy then be trained on certification, enforcement, efficiency improvements, but often face the challenge of “split incentives”, where building and data tracking.

Efforts should be made to keep any fees associated with the license or energy disclosure low in order to minimize additional financial burdens on households. Ideally, if the program takes on the task of enforcing energy disclosure requirements, it can further benefit rent-burdened residents by providing information on how they can potentially reduce energy costs. However, given the current high competition for rental units, renters may not have the opportunity to alter their housing choices based on energy information, so careful thought should be given to the timing and type of energy data that is shared through the licensing program. Finally, when setting up the program, considerations should be given for ensuring that tenants are not displaced as a result of energy efficiency upgrades. Implementation of a licensing and disclosure program should be carefully designed to address the concerns of elderly and immigrant residents, for whom housing stability is often connected with health and safety. 37BUILDINGS MONITORING PROGRESS COST Performance Metrics Avoided Cost Funding Mechanisms • Compliance rates • While it is difficult to • Property Assessed Clean Energy: To help offset the upfront capital and violation rates estimate the extent costs of energy upgrades, enrollment by the City in a Property Assessed • kWh of energy saved to which energy Clean Energy (PACE) program could be a potential financing mechanism. disclosure requirements Under this type of program, the upfront costs of energy upgrades can be • MTCO e of GHG 2 by landlords will provided from the sale of municipal bonds or through private investment emissions reduced directly result in companies, and is repaid through property taxes by the property owner • % on-site renewable energy upgrades This approach enables owners to undertake more comprehensive energy energy generated and subsequent upgrades with longer payback periods of up to 20 years.

This will be accomplished by new planted areas, stormwater infrastructure that will support large tree growth, and permeable surfaces on the bike paths and in some buffer areas. New permeable areas will lead to a reduction of 0.7 acres of impervious hard surface. 645 ACTION AREA: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT PRIORITY ACTION: INVESTIGATE A STORMWATER ENTERPRISE FUND TO IMPROVE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT To address precipitation related flooding, example, the stormwater system has been send more stormwater into the system would there are two key strategies: 1) updating our overwhelmed during major flooding events pay more into the stormwater enterprise fund. existing stormwater management policies such as those that occurred in May 2006, Under Somerville’s current system, properties to include climate change projections in the March 2010 and July 2010 storms. with large parking lots or large areas of design criteria for City infrastructure projects impervious surface, but little wastewater A stormwater enterprise fund, as with other and new development, and 2) develop a discharge (like big retail stores) are not paying enterprise-type systems, is a fee-for-use more equitable funding mechanism to their fair share of the costs to maintain and approach to infrastructure management.

Service fee rate methodologies are considerations: designed to attain a fair and reasonable apportionment of cost of providing services and facilities. If designed fairly, a stormwater enterprise fund would not increase costs significantly for a household, but instead would shift the cost to manage stormwater to the property owners who contribute the most. This would likely have little negative impact on overall housing affordability in the city. 67STORMWATER ENTERPRISE FUND FEASIBILITY STUDY Benefits of community a. Program goals engagement in b.

A consumption based inventory will show that even though emissions might be generated from within Somerville’s borders, our consumer choices make us responsible for emissions generated and counted elsewhere. This shifts the perspective that the producer is solely responsible for the emissions and shares that responsibility with the consumer, who is generating demand for that product. 82ENVIRONMENT PRECEDENTS Consumption-based Inventories while products with high use-related by 33% below 2006 levels by 2020.

In addition, a citywide food scrap collection program would cost as much if 3% not more per ton as trash services. While composting is not a climate priority today, a Contribution food waste diversion program could lessen the risk of rising emissions, if waste disposal of solid waste in a waste-to-energy facility is unavailable in to 2014 the future. A food waste diversion program that sends waste to anaerobic digesters emissions could provide the fuel for renewable energy generation. However, our region inventory does not yet have robust and economically sustainable anaerobic digestion facilities and infrastructure. The City will continue to monitor the landscape of food waste diversion options in the region to determine if a sustainable and cost-effective program could be created in the future. And while composting might not have a big climate impact, food does account for a significant proportion of household consumption-based emissions. So reducing food waste overall and limiting meat and dairy consumption can help to reduce consumption-related Progress toward Carbon Neutrality emissions from agriculture outside of 2030: 1% (9,900 MTCO 2e/yr) Somerville. 2050: 2% (12,300 MTCOe/yr) 2 0% 2050 Carbon Neutrality Goal 100% 848 ACTION AREA: HEALTHY AND RESILIENT COMMUNITY COMMUNITY PRIORITY ACTION: ESTABLISH A PREPAREDNESS EDUCATION PROGRAM AND AN EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM THAT HELP PROTECT THE COMMUNITY FROM FLOODING AND EXTREME HEAT EVENTS.

Implementation Short-term (0-3 years) steps and schedule: • Identify and partner with relevant health and social service organizations responsible for emergency communication • Meet with service providers to understand best methods of communication and to identify next steps for implementing communication program. • Develop community alert and response programs • Establish enhanced communication networks focusing on hard-to-reach populations • Establish heat and flood response guidance and train partner organizations and residents. • Incorporate climate-related scenarios into emergency response plans and activities, including alert systems • Train and drill public health officials, providers, and most-at-risk residents • Incorporate emergency outreach efforts into the SustainaVille climate leadership program • Ensure availability of shelters and cooling centers for population most at risk. Medium Term (4-6 years) • Establish neighborhood organization capacity to serve as Climate Resilience Hubs • Develop supporting policies that protect residents • Assess staffing needs for emergency planning and response 89COMMUNITY PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION Equity Those who are most at risk of climate impacts are populations that already face health and economic disparities. People who considerations: already are suffering from existing health issues, or challenges affording basic needs, such as food and housing, typically have fewer resources to draw on in case of an emergency. Therefore, outreach about climate impacts should not assume everyone has an equal ability to prepare or bounce back quickly from an extreme heat or flooding event. Efforts should be made to target residents who might be more at risk and help connect them with resources and support services. Emergency shelters and cooling centers should be adapted to unique cultural, language, health, and personal needs. For example, residents with pets need shelter or cooling center options where they can bring their animals. WHAT THE CITY IS ALREADY DOING • The City currently sends out alerts during extreme weather events to let residents know how they can prepare. • The City has created Emergency Preparedness Plans for various scenarios, including shelter plans. • The City is prepared to open cooling centers in public buildings, including the Council on Aging, schools, libraries, 165 Broadway, and the public safety building. • The Fire Department and Health and Human Services are working on vulnerable population plan in case of evacuation. 90COMMUNITY PRECEDENTS Community Resiliency Hubs: and classroom spaces, can be impacted by leveraging neighborhood-level volunteers to extreme heat and flood events.

Performance Performance metrics can also be developed using public health indicators for equity and wellness, including disparities in health outcomes and exposures to climate impacts. These can include existing Metrics metrics or ones that could be readily available. For example: • Number of total hospitalizations, and hospitalization and Emergency Department visits for heat- related stress, asthma, and heat attacks during and closely following extreme events. As available, neighborhood rates by race and ethnicity. Additional measures of successful preparedness and emergency response could include: • Police and fire calls during extreme climate event. • Success of evacuations and returns to homes. Note that while health outcomes cannot be directly tied to the enhanced communication networks, their trends will be important to monitor to identify potential areas of concern and success. RELATED ACTIONS • Track and monitor vector-borne diseases. • Training for the Medical Reserve Corps. The MRC is a volunteer group, and many of the volunteers have a medical background. MRC members could be trained to do public outreach/education for heat and flood emergencies (for example, teaching people about heat exhaustion and the need to stay cool). MRCs could play a role staffing shelters (cooling or otherwise) and assisting people with functional needs. MRCs could also be used to check on elderly residents in a heat emergencies. The 4B Regional unit covers Somerville (See: https://mrc.hhs.gov/partnerfldr/Partner). 93COMMUNITY COST Avoided cost range from savings from averted harm to people and indirect benefits from improved conditions. Case studies in the literature point to the importance of the following averted costs regarding protected human life and health: • The costs associated with asthma (associated with flooding and water leaks) are substantial. The American Lung Association estimates that the cost of asthma in the U.S. in 2007 was $19.7 billion for both direct and indirect costs. Furthermore, asthma resulted in 12.8 million missed school days and nearly 10.1 million missed workdays in the US. Massachusetts has higher rates of asthma than the U.S. average. Somerville rates of asthma prevalence are similar to the state average; yet also include more populations at risk of poorly-controlled asthma. avoided cost: • Health-related costs due to heat-related premature death and hospitalization in the Northeast’s urban centers are sizeable even at modest levels. • Significant cardiovascular and respiratory health impacts and their costs are associated with air pollution. A recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health on the health impacts in Massachusetts accruing if it were to adopt a carbon fee estimated the co-benefits from reduced GHG use to be $10/ton, increasing by $5 per year until it reaches a plateau of $40 per ton. Cumulative savings over an implementation year of 2017 through 2040: $2.9 billion ($2017 USD) of cumulative health benefits between 2017 and 2040, worth $2.0 billion ($2017 USD) if discounted to 2017 at 3% per year. The costs associated with this broad range of strategies may vary widely depending upon how the implementation fully develops. Among categories of costs can be: Capital cost/ • Funds added to existing health and wellness programs to extend their outreach to include climate operational change education. cost: • Additional staff for expanded services. • Additional communication expenditures There is an array of existing programs and grants that might provide funding options: • The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA or SARA Title III) requires the formation of Local or Regional Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs and REPCs). These committees are responsible for protecting their communities from incidents involving hazardous materials but might funding considered for climate related extreme events. mechanisms: • Apply for the community-driven approach FEMA’s Whole Communities Program to help residents, business owners and institutional leaders from “high risk” communities to complete and implement individualized disaster readiness and response plans. • Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Grant Program (MVP). 949 ACTION AREA: PATHWAY TO 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY COMMUNITY PRIORITY ACTION: EXTEND THE COMMUNITY CHOICE ELECTRICITY AGGREGATION PROGRAM AND INCREASE SHARE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY.

CCE helps to stabilize rates over a period of time, making electricity costs more predictable. The current CCE program is saving Somerville residents and businesses money, and future CCE programs should continue to consider cost as an important factor.

They may considerations: have several barriers to public participation and to taking action on preparedness and environmental protection. Such population groups have limited time, resources, may speak languages other than English, and are not tied to City processes. Holding meetings at culturally-familiar sites and during events where residents already congregate can support engagement. Priorities identified by such residents should be integrated in community-driven strategies. There are several Climate Justice Frameworks that have been advanced which can provide guidance. The 2017 Guide to Equitable, Community-Driven Climate Preparedness Planning by the Urban Sustainability Directors Network offers one such roadmap. The Somerville community is already engaged in addressing climate change.

Furthermore, a regional approach to addressing flood risk along the Mystic River can create opportunities to advance equity at the regional scale. For housing affordability, transportation, and economic opportunity to improve for Somerville residents, we need a strong region that is equally prepared to respond to climate impacts. A regional approach can help to make sure that all communities are responding to climate risks, not just the best resourced communities.

Progress on implementation of the priority actions in Somerville Climate Forward and their related steps will be reported annually as part of SustainaVille, the City’s platform for reporting on GHG reduction and resiliency initiatives.88 Climate change is a global issue that cannot be solved in isolation by the City of Somerville, its residents, or its many engaged stakeholders. Fostering partnerships and strengthening regional collaboration initiatives will play a pivotal role in achieving the ambitious goals established and ensuring the continued success of Somerville Climate Forward. The City will continue to play an active role in regional organizations, such as the Metro Mayors Climate Preparedness Task Force; in State-led resiliency and carbon neutrality initiatives, such as the Green Communities Program; and engaging the community with existing and new programs such as the recommended SustainaVille Leaders Program (detailed in Action Area 10 of this plan). 141NEXT STEPS Although the City cannot take on this charge alone, it can create policies and programs that make it easier for everyone in Somerville to take action. Our success will ultimately be determined by Somerville’s residents, businesses, and institutions commitment to this plan. Across our community, small daily choices and behaviors can add up to a big impact. Through simple actions, such as installing home energy retrofits and decisions like walking instead of driving, we can collectively contribute to reduction in GHG emissions and help do our part to improve the resilience of Somerville’s built, natural, economic, and social systems. We hope you join us in working to move Somerville forward. 88 City of Somerville. Sustainaville. (2018). Retrieved from: https://www.somervillema.gov/sustainaville 142",

        "LETTER FROM MAYOR JOSEPH A. CURTATONE Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. It also presents a tremendous opportunity to think differently about how we plan and live in cities. By taking action to slow climate change and to prepare for its impacts, we can forge a better future for our children, make Somerville healthier and safer, stimulate the local economy by driving demand for local clean energy and transportation solutions, and make our community stronger and more resilient. In Somerville, we can lead by showing that bold transformations are possible. Climate change is a complex, collective action problem. But in Somerville, we don’t shy away from a challenge, we roll up our sleeves and find solutions. Somerville Climate Forward is full of solutions that will help us work collectively to become a carbon-neutral and resilient City. In true Somerville fashion, we used a data-driven approach to develop the actions in Somerville Climate Forward. This plan is the culmination of years of work to fully understand what climate change means here in Somerville. The Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment informed us of our most pressing needs to make our community more resilient to climate impacts; our greenhouse gas inventories tell us how we, as a community and city government, contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions and where we need to cut back the most; and the Pathways to Carbon Neutrality Study showed us what it would take to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Armed with this data, we were able to push our action planning further and prioritize a short list of actions that are detailed and implementable. Not all of the actions in this plan will be easy, but I know that Somerville is up to the challenge. Now more than ever, we need bold local solutions and transformational change that are only possible through collective action. Solving the problem of climate change will require transformations of our transportation, energy, and economic systems that have been driven by fossil fuels for generations. It is important for us all to find ways to reduce emissions every day, whether that is by choosing to take a bus instead of a car or using less energy at home. But government plays a critical role in facilitating the systems-level changes that make it easier for everyone to make more sustainable choices. Whether that is bringing the Green Line to Somerville to make it easier to forego a car or implementing the community choice electricity program to bring down the cost of renewable electricity. It is also vital that we do this equitably. Climate action cannot leave people behind. On both the global and local scale, those who have contributed least to climate change will be the most impacted and often have the fewest opportunities to benefit from climate action. If we are to succeed in our goals, everyone needs to be able to participate in climate action, not just those with the most resources. This is why we have identified equity considerations for each action in this plan, and will continue to look for ways to implement this plan so that it benefits everyone in our community and does not increase burdens on those in our community who are already struggling. This plan alone will not prevent global climate change, but if cities around the world take bold action to transform into carbon neutral and resilient cities, we can create a better future for all. Let’s be bold toggether and move Somerville forward. ii",

Presented in this report are: • VISION AND GOALS • THE 13 ACTION AREAS AND 22 PRIORITY ACTIONS • IMPLEMENTATION TIMEFRAME The priority action areas were selected based on their ability to solve a key issue identified by either the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment or the Pathways to Carbon Neutrality Study. The specific priority action was selected based on the impact it can have, the co-benefits it can provide, the feasibility of implementing it in Somerville, and by asking working groups, technical experts, City staff, and regional partners: what do we need to do to get started addressing this problem? The focus of this plan is to make a difference now. The actions are intended to be initiated within 5 years. Some of the actions will take longer to complete than others. In five years, the plan will be revisited in order to reassess priorities and identify new action areas. Collectively, the priority actions represent the most important next steps for Somerville to take in order to have the biggest impact on mitigating and preparing for climate change. 6",

The disclosure process could be streamlined by working with the energy utilities such that the information can be requested in a streamlined fashioned, and delivered in a standardized format that contains enough detail to enable informed decision making (e.g., a breakdown of energy consumption by energy end uses as opposed to aggregated data on energy consumption).

Efforts should be made to keep any fees associated with the license or energy disclosure low in order to minimize additional financial burdens on households. Ideally, if the program takes on the task of enforcing energy disclosure requirements, it can further benefit rent-burdened residents by providing information on how they can potentially reduce energy costs. However, given the current high competition for rental units, renters may not have the opportunity to alter their housing choices based on energy information, so careful thought should be given to the timing and type of energy data that is shared through the licensing program. Finally, when setting up the program, considerations should be given for ensuring that tenants are not displaced as a result of energy efficiency upgrades. Implementation of a licensing and disclosure program should be carefully designed to address the concerns of elderly and immigrant residents, for whom housing stability is often connected with health and safety. 37",

This means that reductions will total approximately 12,300 GHG emissions separating food scraps and disposing of the MT CO e/yr or 2% of the City’s carbon 2 material separately from Somerville’s trash • Avoided costs associated with neutrality goal would have a negligible effect on community over-production of food products emissions. In addition, a citywide food scrap collection program would cost as much if 3% not more per ton as trash services. While composting is not a climate priority today, a Contribution food waste diversion program could lessen the risk of rising emissions, if waste disposal of solid waste in a waste-to-energy facility is unavailable in to 2014 the future. A food waste diversion program that sends waste to anaerobic digesters emissions could provide the fuel for renewable energy generation. However, our region inventory does not yet have robust and economically sustainable anaerobic digestion facilities and infrastructure. The City will continue to monitor the landscape of food waste diversion options in the region to determine if a sustainable and cost-effective program could be created in the future. And while composting might not have a big climate impact, food does account for a significant proportion of household consumption-based emissions. So reducing food waste overall and limiting meat and dairy consumption can help to reduce consumption-related Progress toward Carbon Neutrality emissions from agriculture outside of 2030: 1% (9,900 MTCO 2e/yr) Somerville. 2050: 2% (12,300 MTCOe/yr) 2 0% 2050 Carbon Neutrality Goal 100% 84",

        "COMMUNITY PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION Equity Those who are most at risk of climate impacts are populations that already face health and economic disparities. People who considerations: already are suffering from existing health issues, or challenges affording basic needs, such as food and housing, typically have fewer resources to draw on in case of an emergency. Therefore, outreach about climate impacts should not assume everyone has an equal ability to prepare or bounce back quickly from an extreme heat or flooding event. Efforts should be made to target residents who might be more at risk and help connect them with resources and support services. Emergency shelters and cooling centers should be adapted to unique cultural, language, health, and personal needs. For example, residents with pets need shelter or cooling center options where they can bring their animals. WHAT THE CITY IS ALREADY DOING • The City currently sends out alerts during extreme weather events to let residents know how they can prepare. • The City has created Emergency Preparedness Plans for various scenarios, including shelter plans. • The City is prepared to open cooling centers in public buildings, including the Council on Aging, schools, libraries, 165 Broadway, and the public safety building. • The Fire Department and Health and Human Services are working on vulnerable population plan in case of evacuation. 90",

        "COMMUNITY MONITORING PROCESS The following measures align with activities and can help monitor progress and efficacy: • Number of social service and health organizations and affiliated providers participating in a climate alert network • Number of residents reached through communication alert systems • Number of hard-to-reach residents participating in outreach and education events, and signing up for alerts through the network. • Residents accessing cooling centers during extreme heat events. Performance Performance metrics can also be developed using public health indicators for equity and wellness, including disparities in health outcomes and exposures to climate impacts. These can include existing Metrics metrics or ones that could be readily available. For example: • Number of total hospitalizations, and hospitalization and Emergency Department visits for heat- related stress, asthma, and heat attacks during and closely following extreme events. As available, neighborhood rates by race and ethnicity. Additional measures of successful preparedness and emergency response could include: • Police and fire calls during extreme climate event. • Success of evacuations and returns to homes. Note that while health outcomes cannot be directly tied to the enhanced communication networks, their trends will be important to monitor to identify potential areas of concern and success. RELATED ACTIONS • Track and monitor vector-borne diseases. • Training for the Medical Reserve Corps. The MRC is a volunteer group, and many of the volunteers have a medical background. MRC members could be trained to do public outreach/education for heat and flood emergencies (for example, teaching people about heat exhaustion and the need to stay cool). MRCs could play a role staffing shelters (cooling or otherwise) and assisting people with functional needs. MRCs could also be used to check on elderly residents in a heat emergencies. The 4B Regional unit covers Somerville (See: https://mrc.hhs.gov/partnerfldr/Partner). 93",
        "COMMUNITY COST Avoided cost range from savings from averted harm to people and indirect benefits from improved conditions. Case studies in the literature point to the importance of the following averted costs regarding protected human life and health: • The costs associated with asthma (associated with flooding and water leaks) are substantial. The American Lung Association estimates that the cost of asthma in the U.S. in 2007 was $19.7 billion for both direct and indirect costs. Furthermore, asthma resulted in 12.8 million missed school days and nearly 10.1 million missed workdays in the US. Massachusetts has higher rates of asthma than the U.S. average. Somerville rates of asthma prevalence are similar to the state average; yet also include more populations at risk of poorly-controlled asthma. avoided cost: • Health-related costs due to heat-related premature death and hospitalization in the Northeast’s urban centers are sizeable even at modest levels. • Significant cardiovascular and respiratory health impacts and their costs are associated with air pollution. A recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health on the health impacts in Massachusetts accruing if it were to adopt a carbon fee estimated the co-benefits from reduced GHG use to be $10/ton, increasing by $5 per year until it reaches a plateau of $40 per ton. Cumulative savings over an implementation year of 2017 through 2040: $2.9 billion ($2017 USD) of cumulative health benefits between 2017 and 2040, worth $2.0 billion ($2017 USD) if discounted to 2017 at 3% per year. The costs associated with this broad range of strategies may vary widely depending upon how the implementation fully develops. Among categories of costs can be: Capital cost/ • Funds added to existing health and wellness programs to extend their outreach to include climate operational change education. cost: • Additional staff for expanded services. • Additional communication expenditures There is an array of existing programs and grants that might provide funding options: • The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA or SARA Title III) requires the formation of Local or Regional Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs and REPCs).

They may considerations: have several barriers to public participation and to taking action on preparedness and environmental protection. Such population groups have limited time, resources, may speak languages other than English, and are not tied to City processes. Holding meetings at culturally-familiar sites and during events where residents already congregate can support engagement. Priorities identified by such residents should be integrated in community-driven strategies. There are several Climate Justice Frameworks that have been advanced which can provide guidance.

Furthermore, a regional approach to addressing flood risk along the Mystic River can create opportunities to advance equity at the regional scale. For housing affordability, transportation, and economic opportunity to improve for Somerville residents, we need a strong region that is equally prepared to respond to climate impacts. A regional approach can help to make sure that all communities are responding to climate risks, not just the best resourced communities.

        "NEXT STEPS The Office of Sustainability and Environment will be responsible for overseeing implementation of the plan, and for ensuring it stays up-to-date with the latest climate science, technologies, and community trends. Progress on implementation of the priority actions in Somerville Climate Forward and their related steps will be reported annually as part of SustainaVille, the City’s platform for reporting on GHG reduction and resiliency initiatives.88 Climate change is a global issue that cannot be solved in isolation by the City of Somerville, its residents, or its many engaged stakeholders. Fostering partnerships and strengthening regional collaboration initiatives will play a pivotal role in achieving the ambitious goals established and ensuring the continued success of Somerville Climate Forward. The City will continue to play an active role in regional organizations, such as the Metro Mayors Climate Preparedness Task Force; in State-led resiliency and carbon neutrality initiatives, such as the Green Communities Program; and engaging the community with existing and new programs such as the recommended SustainaVille Leaders Program (detailed in Action Area 10 of this plan). 141",
        "NEXT STEPS Although the City cannot take on this charge alone, it can create policies and programs that make it easier for everyone in Somerville to take action. Our success will ultimately be determined by Somerville’s residents, businesses, and institutions commitment to this plan. Across our community, small daily choices and behaviors can add up to a big impact. Through simple actions, such as installing home energy retrofits and decisions like walking instead of driving, we can collectively contribute to reduction in GHG emissions and help do our part to improve the resilience of Somerville’s built, natural, economic, and social systems. We hope you join us in working to move Somerville forward. 88 City of Somerville. Sustainaville. (2018). Retrieved from: https://www.somervillema.gov/sustainaville 142",
