According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)1, a NHMP enables communities to:  Increase education and awareness around threats, hazards, and vulnerabilities;  Build partnerships for risk reduction involving government, organizations, businesses, and the public;  Identify long‐term, broadly‐supported strategies for risk reduction;  Align risk reduction with other state, tribal, or community objectives;  Identify implementation approaches that focus resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities; and  Communicate priorities to potential sources of funding. The goal of this NHMP is to identify both known and potential risks from current and future natural hazards and to develop, through the community planning process, actions to reduce the risk from these hazards. Each of these hazard mitigation actions is intended to either mitigate the susceptibility of the community to a natural hazard or to better prepare the City of Melrose to protect and manage the community in the occurrence of a natural hazard. Implementing these actions can reduce the risk of loss of life and property in Melrose by lessening the impact of natural hazards. Further, having an up‐to‐date NHMP approved by FEMA for the City of Melrose makes the City eligible for non‐disaster funding and assistance from FEMA to implement actions outlined in this NHMP. All hazard mitigation actions are contingent on funding and those identified as responsible for implementing actions are also responsible for obtaining funding. The NHMP process was led by the Melrose Department of Public Works and included input from community representatives, the public, and regional partners (Section 2). The 2017 Master Plan, “Melrose Forward” specifically recommended updating the NHMP; this plan fulfills that action item2. This NHMP will serve as the primary resilience planning document for the City of Melrose. 1 These benefits are directly from FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Planning website: https://www.fema.gov/hazard‐mitigation‐planning 2 Melrose Forward: A Community Vision and Master Plan. 2017. Available at: https://www.cityofmelrose.org/sites/melrosema/files/uploads/executive_summary_to_melrose_forward. pdf 1‐1Section 1  Introduction 1.1.1 Role of the 2004 Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan Melrose last developed a NHMP in 2004. Many of the natural hazard mitigation actions from the 2004 plan have been implemented and have resulted in a reduced risk of flooding in certain parts of Melrose. The findings and lessons learned from the 2004 plan have been incorporated into this plan, as appropriate. Details on the status of actions from the 2004 plan are summarized in Section 5.1. 1.1.2 Overlap and Integration of the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Program Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) launched the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) grant program in 2016. This program provides grants to cities and towns in Massachusetts to begin planning for climate change and taking action to increase resiliency. The City of Melrose was awarded a $19,000 MVP planning grant from EEA to conduct Community Resilience Building (CRB) workshops in the City. Conducting the workshops allowed Melrose to achieve “MVP” designation from the Commonwealth – a designation that gives the City access to further funding to implement resilient actions. The City capitalized on the opportunity to integrate both the MVP and NHMP planning processes into one resilience document. This follows the Commonwealth’s lead of including the impacts from climate change as natural hazards. In September 2018, Massachusetts adopted a first of its kind State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP). 1.2 Brief History of Melrose Melrose was originally called “Ponde Fielde” because of the many ponds and streams located around the region. It was considered part of Charlestown until the mid‐1600s. As the 18th century progressed, the small village, then known as the North End of Malden (North Malden), began to grow as a prosperous farming community. After the American Revolution in 1776, trades people, merchants, shoe makers, and innkeepers began to settle in the village. North Malden remained a thinly populated area, despite the established trade market that emerged in neighboring Boston. In 1845 the Boston and Maine Railroad built a track through North Malden. Overnight, the quiet village of North Malden became populated by those who worked in Boston but wanted to escape the crowded metropolis of the big city for fresh air and open spaces. The population boomed when three railroad stations (Wyoming, Cedar Park, and Melrose Highlands) were constructed allowing an easier commute for residents to the city. North Malden, upon reaching a condition of self‐sufficiency in 1889, established itself as the City of Melrose. Parks and schools were constructed, police and fire services were instituted, and three distinct shopping districts allowed the residents in the city to rely on the goods and services provided exclusively by locals. Today Melrose prospers with its ideal location between Boston and Route 128. The City is now more self‐sufficient than ever by providing what is necessary to support its residents’ housing, education, health care, employment, shopping, entertainment, recreation, and leisure needs. 1‐2Section 1  Introduction 1.3 Environmental Setting Melrose is an idyllic, small New England city located 7 miles north of Boston. The City is approximately 4.76 square miles of total land area with nearly 28,000 residents. Main Street in the heart of downtown Melrose has a Victorian feel with buildings dating back to the mid to late 1800s. Ell Pond dominates the landscape in the center of the City with a gazebo, walking trails and scenic views. The Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development calls Melrose a “garden city” since trees line its streets, and parks and open space are spread out through and around the City. The “green belt” of surrounding communities, including the Middlesex Falls Reservation to the west, provides a natural buffer from more urban communities beyond. The residential areas of Melrose are diverse in both architectural style and in the density of its population. Historic neighborhoods are located in the more urban areas near downtown, with newer development near the Mount Hood golf course. Culture and recreation play a role in the everyday lives of the citizens of Melrose. The City is proud of its 100‐year old Melrose Symphony Orchestra, while its many parks and open spaces provide residents a place to exercise, play, or relax with friends. 1.4 Changes in Development since the 2004 Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan Since the development of the 2004 Plan, Melrose has been featured as the “hottest ZIP code” in the United States and one of the “Best Small Cities in America.” Melrose continues to be a desirable place to live, with a strong economic base, a multitude of transportation options, and valued parks and open space for all to enjoy. These are positive advances for the City that come with challenges such as limited housing inventory and keeping housing costs affordable. The City is falling short on the amount of subsidized housing available, according to the Commonwealth’s standards. Melrose continues to look at options for increasing housing production and reducing barriers to creating new housing units. The City has placed a priority on improving facilities and infrastructure in Melrose, implementing many of the action outlined in the 2004 NHMP and improving operational facilities management. Melrose Veterans Memorial Middle School, the Melrose High School, the Milano Senior Center, and other facilities have been rebuilt or upgraded to better standards. The details of this progress is detailed in Section 5. The City has been designated a Green Community by the Commonwealth, has substantially reduced energy use and related greenhouse gas emissions, and has saved on energy costs. 1‐3Section 2 The Planning Process 2.1 Community Team The NHMP team was led by the Public Works Department, with input and guidance from the Office of Planning and Community Development and support from the Mayor’s Office. A Community Team consisting of public officials, regional organizations, neighboring communities and residents were engaged throughout the planning process and provided a broad spectrum of local knowledge and experience to inform this NHMP for the City of Melrose. Details on the Community Team participants (and those who were invited) and the methods for soliciting and receiving input from them are provided in the following sections. 2.2 Process for Public Input and Feedback The public planning process was led by the Melrose Department of Public Works and their consulting firm, CDM Smith. There were four primary methods by which the City received input: 1. MVP Workshops held in April 2018 with community representatives with additional assistance of the Planning Department; 2. NHMP Community Input and MVP Public Listening Session held on June 21, 2018 for the general public; 3. Regional Input meeting held on September 25, 2018 with regional partners; and 4. Public meeting held on March 11, 2019, including the release of a draft of this plan a week prior to this meeting. Details of each of these processes are below. Through this series of workshops and meetings, the public gave input to this NHMP on natural hazards, areas of concern, vulnerabilities and strengths in Melrose, and plans for future mitigation activities and priorities. The methods of soliciting feedback are described further below and results of feedback received from these public planning activities can be found in Appendix A. The City requested participation from community representatives and regional partners via direct emails. Public participation was encouraged through meeting notices posted on the City’s website and Mayor Infurna’s blog. 2.2.1 Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Workshops The MVP workshops’ central objectives were to:  Define top local natural and climate‐related hazards of concern;  Identify existing and future strengths and vulnerabilities;  Develop prioritized actions for the community; and 2‐1Section 2  The Planning Process  Identify immediate opportunities to collaboratively advance actions to increase resilience. Participates were asked to complete a brief online survey, which focuses on how the community currently perceives, assesses, and acts to reduce risks to which informed the workshops (see Appendix A). The workshops were held on April 5 and 11, 2018 from 8:45am – 1:00pm at Mount Hood Golf Course in Melrose. The first workshop began with a large group discussion on the hazards that face the community that will be impacted by climate change. Smaller multi‐ disciplinary groups then prioritized the top four hazards, identified and prioritized the societal, infrastructure and environmental vulnerabilities impacted by the hazards. At the second workshop, hazard mitigation actions were developed to address the vulnerabilities. This information was captured in risk matrices for each small group. Hazard mitigation actions were prioritized by small working group and were presented to the larger group for comprehensive prioritization, determined by participant voting. The priorities set during this process reflect the importance of the hazard, vulnerability, and mitigation strategy to participant’s organization and the magnitude of the impacts to the society, infrastructure, and environmental assets in Melrose. Qualitative magnitude of benefits and costs were considered in the final prioritization of mitigation strategies. This information was captured by meeting scribes and summarized in the MVP plan in Appendix A. The leadership and core team members for planning and facilitating the MVP process were:  Gail Infurna, Mayor of Melrose  Martha Grover, Energy Efficiency Manager / Table Facilitator  Elena Proakis Ellis, City Engineer / Table Facilitator  John Scenna, Director of Public Works  Lauren Miller, Lead Facilitator / Consultant Team, CDM Smith  Lauren Klonsky, Table Facilitator / Consultant Team, CDM Smith  Workshop scribes: Scott Dixon (Department of Public Works), Amy Heidebrecht (Department of Public Works), Lori Massa (Office of Planning and Community Development) Community representatives that were invited via email by Mayor Infurna and participated in the process are shown in Table 2‐1. 2‐2Section 2  The Planning Process Table 2‐1.

This report and other resilience planning information may also be found at: https://www.cityofmelrose.org/home/events/10693. The MVP process and MVP final report were used to inform this NHMP by identifying and prioritizing: 1) natural hazards in Melrose, 2) the vulnerability of societal, infrastructure, and environmental assets in Melrose, and 3) hazard 2‐3Section 2  The Planning Process mitigation strategies to address vulnerabilities; this information is included in Sections 3, 4, and 6 of this NHMP. 2.2.2 NHMP Community Input and MVP Public Listening Session The City of Melrose held a public forum called “Preparing for Extreme Weather Events: A Listening Session” on June 21, 2018 from 7:00pm – 8:45pm at the Melrose Middle School. The purpose of the meeting was to present the City’s readiness to handle climate‐related events and emergencies, to discuss how we can become more prepared, and to hear suggestions and feedback from the community on this important topic. The meeting was open to the entire community and served as both a forum for the community to provide input on the development of this NHMP and the required MVP “public listening session.” A notice for this meeting was published on the City’s events calendar prior to the meeting here: https://www.cityofmelrose.org/home/events/10693. Mayor Infurna posted the notice in her blog at: https://mayorinfurna.wordpress.com/2018/06/14/preparing‐for‐extreme‐weather‐ events‐a‐listening‐session‐on‐june‐21/ Community feedback was received from participants through a facilitated discussion of the MVP process and findings. Participants were also given the opportunity to submit their feedback in writing on hazards and actions to reduce vulnerabilities. Hazard mitigation strategies were prioritized by participant voting. This information was captured by meeting scribes and summarized in the MVP plan (Appendix A). Additional vulnerabilities and hazard mitigation strategies that were identified at this meeting has been incorporated into this plan and included in Section 6. Meeting materials may be found in Appendix A, including an agenda, list of attendees, populated feedback questionnaires, and results of participant voting. 2.2.3 NHMP Regional Input The City held a regional input meeting for this NHMP to provide an opportunity for local and neighboring community partners to give input to the process. The City gained insight on regionally‐focused hazard mitigation strategies and opportunities that could improve the City’s resilience. The meeting was held on September 25, 2018 from 1:00pm‐3:00pm at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Melrose. Verbal input from the group discussion was captured from meeting participants in the form of meeting notes, which may be found in Appendix A. Input from the regional stakeholders was incorporated into this plan by considering additional vulnerabilities and hazard mitigation strategies identified by participants and included in Sections 4 and 6 of this document. Meeting materials such as the meeting agenda, presentation, sign‐in sheet, and meeting notes may also be found in Appendix A. Regional and community representatives that were invited via email to or participated in the regional input meeting are shown in Table 2‐2. 2‐4Section 2  The Planning Process Table 2‐2.

Others were invited to the meetings. 2.3 Continuing Public Outreach and Involvement There was a public forum on March 11, 2019 at the Melrose High School Learning Commons; a draft of this NHMP was posted a week prior to this forum, to allow time for public review. Feedback received at the forum has been incorporated into the plan. The City is committed to keeping the public engaged in the ongoing process of natural hazard mitigation to improve resilience in Melrose. 2‐5Section 3 Natural Hazard Risks 3.1 Introduction to Natural Hazards A natural hazard is defined by the World Bank as a physical process or event (hydro‐ meteorological or oceanographic variables or phenomena) that can harm human health, livelihoods, or natural resources.1 Natural hazards can include atmospheric, hydrologic, geologic, and wildfire events whose incidence or intensity humans have little to no control over. However, humans play an important role in the preparation and response to various natural hazards, resulting in the potential reduction of losses and harmful impacts to human life and/or the physical environment. This section considers the natural hazards identified in the 2013 Massachusetts HMP2 and discusses their applicability to Melrose. It also presents FEMA disaster declarations in Middlesex County since 2001 in each hazard category. In addition, projected climate change impacts have been incorporated into the hazards considered herein, expanding upon the work that was conducted in spring 2018 as part of the City’s MVP process. 3.1.1 Climate Change Interaction with Natural Hazards Climate change continues to be a contributing factor to the frequency and intensity of the natural hazards described below, with the exception of earthquakes and major urban fires.3 As part of the MVP process, the EEA summarized the existing and expected future climate conditions by major watershed in the Commonwealth. Melrose falls into two watersheds; however, the majority of the City is in the Boston Harbor Basin. Therefore, projections from this basin were used as a basis for discussing future climate change in the City. The key takeaways4 from the EEA on the future climate conditions are:  Regardless of geographic scale, rising temperatures, changing precipitation, and extreme weather will continue to affect the people and resources of the Commonwealth.  Average, maximum, and minimum temperatures are expected to increase; seasonally, maximum summer and fall temperatures are expected to see the highest projected increase and minimum winter and fall temperatures are expected to increase. 1 Source: World Bank: https://climatescreeningtools.worldbank.org/content/key‐terms‐0 2 This NHMP was developed at the same time as the 2018 Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP). Melrose used draft information from its development to inform this plan. It may be found at: https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/10/26/SHMCAP‐September2018‐ Full‐Plan‐web.pdf 3 Dam failures are not directly related to climate change; however, changes in precipitation patterns or storm events may impact a dam’s ability properly function. 4 These impacts are taken directly from the document provided by EEA to MVP communities in December 2017 entitled “Massachusetts Climate Change Projections.” 3‐1Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks  The number of days receiving precipitation over one inch are variable, fluctuating between loss and gain of days.  Seasonal projections for total precipitation are also variable for the Boston Harbor basin. The winter season is expected to experience the greatest change with an increase of 0‐20% by mid‐century, and 3‐34% by end of century.  Annual and seasonal projections for consecutive dry days, or for a given period, are variable.  Precipitation will be more variable. “Extreme” precipitation events are likely to occur more often. 3.2 Natural Hazards in Melrose This NHMP update focuses on natural hazards of concern as identified through a review of previous City of Melrose and Commonwealth of Massachusetts HMPs, as well as through information collected via the MVP and public comment processes conducted during plan development. The identified hazards of concern are flooding, severe weather, fire, earthquake, and invasive species. Table 3‐1 below lists these natural hazards, along with subsections describing the detail of each hazard of concern and the source of identification for inclusion in this NHMP. Table 3‐1.

It is assumed that these are the same in Melrose as they are for the Commonwealth under current conditions. However, due to climate change, the frequency and the likely severity of natural hazards may be impacted. This is summarized in Table 3‐2. These are defined as follows6:  Frequency of Occurrence:  Very low: Events that occur less often than once in 100 years (less than 1% probability per year)  Low: Events that occur from once in 50 years to once in 100 years (1% to 2% probability per year)  Medium: Events that occur from once in 5 years to once in 50 years (2% to 20% probability per year)  High: Events that occur more frequently than once in 5 years (greater than 20% probability per year)  Severity (or Impact):  Minor: Limited and scattered property damage, limited damage to public infrastructure and essential services not interrupted, limited injuries or fatalities.  Serious: Scattered major property damage, some minor infrastructure damage, essential services are briefly interrupted, some injuries and/or fatalities.  Extensive: Widespread major property damage, major public infrastructure damage (up to several days for repairs), essential services are interrupted from several hours to several days, many injuries and/or fatalities.  Catastrophic: Property and public infrastructure destroyed, essential services stopped, numerous injuries and fatalities.  Area of Impact (extent of impact on any locality for a particular event):  Minor: Limited and scattered property damage, limited damage to public infrastructure and essential services not interrupted, limited injuries or fatalities. 5 Source: World Bank: https://climatescreeningtools.worldbank.org/content/key‐terms‐0 6 2013 State Hazard Mitigation Plan, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

The frequency is categorized in that plan as “ongoing” as invasive species do not occur at specific moments. The severity and area of impact were assigned to the best extent possible. 3.2.1 Flooding Flooding, the overflow of large volumes of water beyond the usual boundaries, can be caused by various factors. The City of Melrose is most likely to experience floods related to inland riverine overflows, urban drainage issues, and infrastructure or ground failures. Severe weather largely coincides with significant flood events within the City of Melrose and surrounding areas. Heavy rainstorms, nor’easters, tropical storms, and hurricanes have the potential to cause overbank flooding or flash floods. 3‐4Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks Areas most susceptible to flooding include riverine corridors and urban areas with natural and structural characteristics that reduce soil infiltration rates and increase surface runoff during significant precipitation events. Steep stream banks and urban drainage systems increase runoff rates and channel stormwater to area rivers and streams, resulting in the potential for flooding to occur more quickly and reach greater depths.7 Finally, large rain events and the resulting inflow and infiltration into the sanitary sewer system have the potential to cause sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and sewer pump station failures. The extent of the 100‐year flood, 500‐year flood, and other flood hazard areas are identified and discussed further in Sections 4 and 5 and on Figure 5‐1. 3.2.1.1 Dam Failure Flooding can also be caused by significant structural catastrophes such as dam failure. A dam is a constructed barrier intended to obstruct or control the flow of water. Dam failures can be caused by a number of natural and non‐natural factors including dam capacity exceedance, material or structural failure, foundation movement or cracking of concrete or embankment, piping or erosion issues, inadequate operation and maintenance, and/or deliberate acts of sabotage. Earthquakes, landslides, extreme storms, and massive snowmelt may also contribute to the occurrence of dam failures.8 There are two dam systems in Stoneham near the border of Melrose managed by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority that pose a potential hazard to the City ‐ Fells Reservoir Dams and the Spot Pond Dam. The Fells Reservoir Dams are considered high hazard and significant hazard dams by MWRA with 63 million gallons of storage. These classifications do not reflect the dam condition, rather the proximity to residents. The Spot Dams, considered as a significant hazard class by MWRA are earthen embankment with 2,500 million gallons of storage. If these dams were to fail, million gallons of water could inundate the and cause significant flood damage to City of Melrose.9 3.2.1.2 Landslide A landslide occurs when there is any type of ground movement along a steep gradient caused by falling rocks or increased driving forces. The cohesive strength of soils making up a steep slope can become unstable and fail for various reasons. The most common cause of landslide occurrences is the oversaturation of soils from precipitation and water level changes (groundwater or surface water). Flooding, for example, can result in the oversaturation of soils and raise groundwater and surface water levels in a short period of time. Water saturation along a steep gradient would add weight to the slope while pore pressure increases, resulting in the decreased strength of earth materials ultimately causing slope failure. Additional factors that may cause a landslide include undercutting due to high surface flows, construction related causes, 7 2004 City of Melrose Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan, Section 2 8 2013 State Hazard Mitigation Plan, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

This may occur throughout the City, however the Commonwealth categorizes this as a low probability and low impact hazard. 3.2.2 Severe Weather Severe weather includes any critical or dangerous meteorological event that may potentially cause significant losses to public or private property, the environment, or human life. Some severe weather events may also result in flooding, as described in the previous section. Defined below are the severe weather events of concern for the City of Melrose. 3.2.2.1 High Wind The National Weather Service (NWS)10 defines high winds as sustained surface winds of 40 miles per hour (mph) or greater for at least one hour, or wind gusts of 58 mph or greater for any duration of time. The most common high wind impacts include surface damage to natural and manmade structures including downed trees and power lines and damaged roofs, windows, and siding. Power outages may occur during high wind events, especially after prolonged dry periods or periods of excessive rainfall as tree root systems are weakened and the occurrence of downed trees damaging power lines becomes more prominent. High winds are generally a component of several other types of weather events including tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, hurricanes, tropical storms, and nor’easters. Historical occurrences of these other types of weather events associated with high winds are listed in Section 3.4. 3.2.2.2 Thunderstorm Thunderstorms are rain‐ or hail‐bearing storms that produce lightning and thunder. Thunderstorms are generally more common in spring and summer months as warmer temperatures allow for convection of hot air (the transfer of hot air to higher atmospheres). The moisture from rising hot air begins to cool at higher elevations in the atmosphere resulting in cloud development. As those clouds continue to rise and eventually reach below freezing conditions, water molecules continue to cool or freeze creating rain or hail. Interactions between cooled water molecules produce the electricity that forms lightning.11 Severe thunderstorms are defined by the NWS as any storm causing 58 mph winds or greater, a storm producing hail at least 1‐inch in diameter, or a tornado‐producing storm.12 Heavy rainfall and high winds produced by a severe thunderstorm have the potential to cause flooding and high wind damages as discussed in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.1. 10 National Weather Service Advisory Definitions.

Severe Thunderstorm Events impacting Melrose between 2004‐2018 Date Event Impacted Area Description May 13, 2006 Thunderstorm Middlesex County Widespread flooding caused by heavy rainfall over a (“Mother’s (heavy rainfall, 100‐hour period. Governor declared a State of Day Storm”) flooding) Emergency during time of event, and the President declared major disaster status for those affected. For some locations, this was the worst flooding recorded since the 1938 Hurricane and the great rain/snowmelt floods of 1936. A total of 8 to 12 inches of rainfall accumulated during this storm event. Property damages throughout the County were estimated to reach approximately $5M due to damages from this storm. June 23, 2012 Thunderstorm Melrose An upper level disturbance and associated cold pool (damaging provided enough lift and instability to produce winds, large showers and sustained thunderstorms in the hail) Melrose area. October 25, Thunderstorm Melrose Storm front stalled over the region producing 2 to 2017 (heavy rain, 6.5 inches of rainfall within 24 hours. Storm caused high wind, strong winds with speeds reaching 45‐55 mph and flooding) widespread urban and poor drainage flooding. Most notable flooding in Melrose occurred at the intersection of Larchmont Road and Porter Street. 3.2.2.3 Tornado Tornadoes are considered the most violent of all atmospheric storms that have the potential to cause catastrophic damage in localized areas without significant warning. Tornadoes are formed if the following components are present14:  Strong winds in the mid to upper levels of the atmosphere  Clockwise turning of wind, visible from the dust and debris caught in the rotation  Increasing wind speeds in the lowest 10,000 feet of the atmosphere  Warm, moist air near the ground surface with unusually cool air above the surface  A forcing mechanism such as a cold front or leftover weather boundary from a previous severe weather event 13 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Storm Events Database.

When tornado‐related damage is surveyed, it is compared to a list of damage indicators (DIs) and degrees of damage (DoD) which help estimate the range of wind speeds the tornado likely produced. This is done for several structures, then a final rating from EF0 to EF5 is assigned. Tables 3‐4 and 3‐5 list the EF Scale wind speeds and damage indicators.15 Table 3‐4. Enhanced Fujita Scale16 EF Number 3‐second gusts (mph) 0 65‐85 1 86‐110 2 111‐135 3 136‐165 4 166‐200 5 200+ Table 3‐5.

Tropical storms are generally formed in tropical coastal areas where water evaporated from the ocean saturates the air, resulting in condensation of water vapor and the formation of tropical storm clouds. Both tropical storms and hurricanes have a cyclonic nature resulting from the Coriolis force, with counterclockwise wind flow in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise wind flow in the Southern Hemisphere. The size of a tropical storm or cyclone is measured by the distance from its center of circulation to its outermost isobar and can range from very small (138 miles) to very large (552 miles).19 The greatest threats associated with tropical storms are impacts from heavy rainfall and flooding, as well as the potential for tornado formation and power outages. High winds are not as big of a threat but can still cause damage to a lesser degree. Generally, tropical storms lose strength as they move inland further from the ocean, which provides the primary source of energy for the storm. However, storm surges caused by tropical storms along the coastline can potentially reach up to 25 miles inland, putting the City of Melrose at risk. Hurricanes are similar to tropical storms in their formation and movement patterns, however a hurricane has the potential to be much more powerful and damaging than a tropical storm due to higher wind speeds and the greater likelihood of flooding from storm surges and heavy rainfall. Hurricanes begin as tropical storms and are categorized as a hurricane once wind speeds reach a sustained speed of 74 mph or greater.20 The Saffir‐Simpson scale, shown in Table 3‐6, ranks hurricanes on a scale of 1 to 5 based on wind speed. Table 3‐6. Saffir‐Simpson Hurricane Scale21 Category Wind Speed (mph) Potential Damage 1 74 – 95 Minimal: Damage is primarily to vegetation, mobile homes, and some signs. No real damage is done to larger structures. 2 96 – 110 Moderate: Some downed trees, damaged roof coverings, and major damage to mobile homes 3 111 – 130 Extensive: Large downed trees, some structural damage to roofs, destroyed mobile homes, and structural damage to small homes and utilities 4 131 – 155 Extreme: Extensive damage to roofs, windows, and doors, roof systems on small buildings completely fail, and some failed curtain walls 5 155 + Catastrophic: Considerable and widespread roof damage, severe damage to windows and doors, extensive glass failures, and potential for entire buildings to fail 19 2013 State Hazard Mitigation Plan, Commonwealth of Massachusetts Website Accessed on 10/2/18; https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/01/mp/massachusetts‐state‐hazard‐mitigation‐plan.pdf 20 National Weather Service Advisory Definitions.

Accessed 09/12/2018; https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php 3‐9Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks Tropical storms and hurricanes that develop in the Cape Verde Islands or in the Bahamas have the potential to reach coastal New England and impact the City of Melrose, which is near the coast of the Atlantic Ocean; Mount Hood Golf Course is located only 0.75 miles from Rumney Marsh Reservation and less than three miles from Revere Beach. Isolated tornadoes are also a threat during a hurricane as powerful funnel clouds can form along the outer bands of the hurricane as much as 15 hours prior to the landfall of the hurricane itself. Hurricane season for the City of Melrose and the New England region is from June to November; however, most hurricanes on record in the area have occurred between August and October.22 3.2.2.5 Snow and Blizzard Snow is a form of frozen precipitation that requires atmospheric temperatures to be below freezing from the ground surface to the cloud level. A total of approximately ten inches of snow is equivalent to one inch of rain depending on the snow‐liquid ratio of the snow. Snow storms producing sustained winds of 35 mph or greater with only a quarter‐mile of visibility for at least 3 hours are considered blizzards.23 Severe blizzards produce winds upwards of 45 mph at or below 10° F.24 High winds during a severe blizzard blow falling snow or accumulated snow from the ground surface enough to reduce visibility to near zero. Hazards associated with snow storms and blizzards include potential flooding from snowmelt, dangerous travel conditions, and cold stress. The City of Melrose receives approximately 48 to 72 inches of snow annually.25 According to NOAA, there have been 93 days with either blizzards, heavy snow, winter storms, or winter weather conditions between 2005 and the 2017‐2018 winter season in Middlesex County.26 3.2.2.6 Nor’easter Nor’easters are damaging and forceful winter storms that generally occur between October and May. A nor’easter is characterized as a large, counter‐clockwise cyclonic storm with strong northeasterly winds ranging from 20 to 60 mph. These winter storms produce significant amounts of snow and/or rain with the potential for wind gusts exceeding hurricane force intensity. Nor’easter storms tend to remain stationary for several days and have historically occurred more frequently than hurricanes, intensifying the potential risks and impacts caused by heavy precipitation and high winds.27 Powerful nor’easters could cause billions of dollars in damages along with severe economic, transportation, and human disruption from flooding, blocked roads, and unsafe travel conditions. Nor’easters progress in a northeastward direction 22 2013 State Hazard Mitigation Plan, Commonwealth of Massachusetts Website Accessed on 10/2/18; https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/01/mp/massachusetts‐state‐hazard‐mitigation‐plan.pdf 23 National Weather Service, Advisory Definitions.

Additionally, trees and power lines may be pulled down due to the excess weight of ice accumulation. Freezing precipitation could also be in the form of sleet or ice pellets. Ice pellets are formed when a snowflake melts as it passes through warmer atmospheric air and then refreezes into ice as it approaches colder temperatures near the ground.30 Table 3‐7 includes information about the only ice storm on record in Middlesex County between 2004 and 2018 according to the NOAA storm events database.31 Table 3‐7. Ice storm events in Middlesex County between 2004 and 2018 Date Event Impacted Area Description December Ice Storm Western and Three quarters of an inch of ice accumulated on exposed surfaces 11, 2008 Northwest across western and northwest Middlesex County. The hardest hit Middlesex areas were the Monadnock region, Worcester Hills, and the east County slopes of the Berkshires. Downed trees, power lines, and large limbs were common throughout the County due to ice accumulation, blocking many roads. One indirect death was reported due to extended outdoor exposure. 3.2.2.8 Extreme Temperatures Extreme temperatures are defined based on relative climatic averages for specific geographic locations. Temperatures that fall far outside the normal average ranges for a specific area would be considered a temperature extreme. Table 3‐8 shows average seasonal high and low temperatures for the City of Melrose.32 Table 3‐8.

Heat advisories are administered by the NWS when the Heat Index is forecast to reach 100‐104°F.33 Winter storms have the potential to develop extreme cold temperatures. Power outages from severe winter storm events put people at greater risk of developing cold stress related illnesses due to limited or inadequate indoor heating. For the City of Melrose and surrounding region, temperatures reaching 0°F or below are considered extreme cold temperatures. Table 3‐9 lists the extreme temperature events on record for Middlesex County between 2004 and 2018 according to the NOAA storm events database.34 Table 3‐9.

One heat related death was reported July 6 in Medford. Temperatures in the area had climbed above 90 degrees Fahrenheit for the third consecutive day on July 5. February 15‐16, Extreme Western, Heavy snow, blizzard conditions, and coastal 2015 Cold/Wind Chill Northwest, and flooding occurred throughout areas of Middlesex Southeast County. Nearly 60 inches of snow accumulated in Middlesex approximately three weeks causing significant County transportation delays and closures through March of 2015. Roof collapses were a common occurrence due to heavy snow accumulation in both rural and urban areas. A fallen icicle ruptured a gas line in Duxbury, causing an explosion at an Alzheimer’s care facility. Wind chills of 30 to 31 degrees below zero were reported throughout the area. A total of three deaths were reported from indirect causes. February 14, 2016 Extreme Western Arctic high pressure brought strong northwest Cold/Wind Chill Middlesex winds and extremely cold wind chills to the area.

Impacts related to drought can affect potable water supply, as well as the agricultural sector and portions of the natural environment including aquatic ecosystems, wildlife, and plant life. Impacts can be far reaching and include wildfires and economic impacts related to reduced crop yields triggering increased prices for goods and services. Table 3‐10 presents historical drought data for Middlesex County since 2004. Table 3‐10. Historical Drought Conditions from 2004 to 2018 in Melrose, MA35 Date Drought Designation Description Spring 2012 Severe Drought (D2) The U.S. Drought Monitor declared severe drought (D2) over southeastern Middlesex County from April 12 through May 15. This was deemed a meteorological drought due to precipitation levels approximately one half of normal. Summer 2016 Severe Drought (D2) Severe drought designated for Middlesex County in July Extreme Drought (D3) 2016. Continued dry conditions through the month of August extended the drought designation through the summer. The U.S. Drought Monitor continued the Severe Drought (D2) designation in southeastern Middlesex County through August 16th. It was upgraded to an Extreme Drought (D3) designation at that time, which continued through the end of August. Fall 2016 Extreme Drought (D3) The U.S. Drought Monitor continued the Extreme Drought (D3) designation in southeastern Middlesex County from September ‐ November. Winter 2016‐2017 Extreme Drought (D3) Severe The U.S. Drought Monitor continued the Extreme Drought Drought (D2) Moderate (D3) designation in southeastern Middlesex County through Drought (D1) December. Increased moisture levels lowered the designation to a Severe Drought (D2) by January. The U.S. Drought Monitor continued the Severe Drought (D2) designation in Southeast Middlesex County until January 24, when it was reduced to the Moderate Drought (D1) designation. While Melrose is susceptible to the impacts of drought conditions, the City’s potable water supply is provided by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), which can generally provide adequate water supply during drought conditions to a greater degree than non‐MWRA communities in the region. 35 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Storm Events Database.

Both types of fires are discussed in greater detail below. 3.2.3.1 Major Urban Fire Major urban fires are defined as any type of large, uncontrollable fire that occurs in an urban area and causes significant destruction. The cause of major urban fires is more often related to other hazards such as storms, earthquakes, gas leaks, car accidents, hazardous material spills, terrorism, or criminal activity.36 Smaller urban fires are generally related to cooking, smoking, or equipment/appliance malfunctions. The greatest risk related to any type of urban fire is the proximity to human life and the high cost of damage mitigation to the communities affected by the fire. There have been recent examples of major urban fires in communities near Melrose over the past several years, although none within Melrose City limits. One of which was related the gas explosions in the Merrimack Valley in September 2018. This event led to extensive damage, 21 people transported to the hospital, and one death in Lawrence, North Andover, and Andover, Massachusetts; the event required mutual aid from surrounding municipalities and state37. 3.2.3.2 Wildfire Wildfires include fires that occur in undeveloped, vegetated or forested areas and are caused by natural events or by human activity. Wildfires generally begin small and unnoticed due to their rural location, but have the potential to spread quickly, especially during dry, high wind conditions. Wildfires are classified into three different categories38:  Surface fire: Most common type that burns along the forest floor and moves slowly killing or damaging all trees it comes into contact with  Ground fire: Usually occurs during drought conditions and burns the organic materials on the forest floor  Crown fire: Spreads rapidly due to high winds causing flames to jump along treetops. Wildfire season in the City of Melrose and surrounding areas is during the drier, spring and summer months. Snowpack levels and local weather conditions including droughts have a significant impact on the likelihood and intensity of wildfires in the area, though there have been no wildfires in Middlesex County since 2004. 36 2013 State Hazard Mitigation Plan, Commonwealth of Massachusetts Website Accessed on 10/2/18; https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/01/mp/massachusetts‐state‐hazard‐mitigation‐plan.pdf 37 National Transportation Safety Board, Preliminary Report Pipeline.

Earthquakes can range from mild to very violent and destructive events that have the potential to cause significant structural damage and failure. Earthquake activity in the ocean may cause large waves or tsunamis that have the potential to flood adjacent coastal areas. Additionally, soft soils may intensify structural damage caused by inland earthquakes and increase the potential losses resulting from a strong quake. According to the US Geological Survey website, there have been two magnitude 2.5 earthquakes according the Richter Scale (see Table 3‐11) in the state of Massachusetts since 2004, neither of which impacted the City of Melrose.39 The Richter scale measures the strength of earthquakes based on the waves recorded by seismographs. A magnitude 2.5 earthquake is considered minor because they do not result in damage to buildings even if they are felt by people. Table 3‐11. Richter Scale for Earthquake Magnitude40 Magnitude Description 1.0 ‐ 3.0 Not felt except by a very few under especially favorable conditions. 3.0 ‐ 3.9 Felt quite noticeably by persons indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings. Many people do not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing motor cars may rock slightly. Vibrations similar to the passing of a truck. Duration estimated. 4.0 ‐ 4.9 Felt indoors by many during the day. At night, some or many are awakened. Dishes, windows, doors disturbed or broken; walls make cracking sound. Sensation like heavy truck striking building. Standing motor cars rocked noticeably. Unstable objects overturned. Pendulum clocks may stop. 5.0 ‐ 5.9 Felt by all, many frightened. Some heavy furniture moved; a few instances of fallen plaster. Damage negligible in buildings of good design and construction; slight to moderate in well‐built ordinary structures; considerable damage in poorly built or badly designed structures; some chimneys broken. 6.0 ‐ 6.9 Ranges in damage. May be negligible or slight in buildings of good design and construction; slight to moderate in well‐built ordinary structures; great damage in poorly built or badly designed structures; some chimneys, factory stacks, columns, and monuments may be damaged for fall. Heavy furniture overturned. Damage considerable in specially designed structures; well‐designed frame structures thrown out of plumb. Damage great in substantial buildings, with partial collapse. Buildings shifted off foundations. 7.0 and higher Damage ranges from slight to total collapse depending on the design of the building. Damage slight in specially designed structures; considerable damage in ordinary substantial buildings with partial collapse. Damage great in poorly built structures. Some well‐built wooden structures destroyed; most masonry and frame structures destroyed with foundations. Rails bent. Lines of sight and level may be distorted. Objects thrown into the air. 39 USGS Earthquake Hazards Program Website. Accessed 09/13/2018; https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/ 40 USGS Earthquake Hazards Program Website.

These effects may be City‐wide, potentially covering all 3,036 acres of land. The NOAA defines invasive species as any organism that can cause ecological or economic harm in a new environment where it is not native.42 Invasive species are generally spread unintentionally through accidental transport on water vessels or on the clothing, shoes, or luggage of traveling individuals. Occasionally, invasive species are introduced intentionally for garden landscaping purposes or through disposal of unwanted aquatic pets in local waterways. Invasive plant, animal, or aquatic species have the potential to outcompete native organisms for nourishment and/or shelter, potentially causing significant ecosystem changes and reduced biodiversity. Invasive plant species from the list included in the SHMCAP have the potential to be found in the City of Melrose today and in the future. Table 3‐12 lists the SHMCAP invasive species that have the potential to impact the Melrose area according to the City’s Conservation Commission Agent. Table 3‐12.

The waves become larger as they approach landfall, potentially causing significant flooding and destruction to coastal areas. Extreme tsunami events could reach up to 10 miles inland depending on the shape and slope of the shoreline, as well as the elevation changes as you move further inland. The probability of Melrose being impacted by a tsunami is very low. The City’s distance from the coastline and fact that open space is the nearest point to the ocean (Mount Hood Golf course) provides a means of defense against the initial destructive impact of a tsunami wave. If Melrose were to be impacted, flooding would be minimal and could be addressed using the same mitigation strategies as for other flooding events. 3.3.2 Coastal Hazards Coastal hazards include erosion and sea‐level rise. High energy storms and flooding along the coast present a risk for land erosion over time depending on the intensity and frequency of storms. Additionally, climate change impacts will ultimately lead to changes in sea‐levels, making coastal areas the most susceptible to inundation. However, the City of Melrose is 0.75 miles from Rumney Marsh Reservation and over two miles from the Revere Beach coastline, therefore any impacts from such hazards are not of great concern. 3‐17Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks 3.4 Recent Disaster Declarations The City of Melrose and the surrounding communities of Middlesex County have experienced 23 FEMA‐declared disaster events since 1991 from natural hazard events. Each event has caused significant damages to the affected communities and some events resulted in fatalities. A disaster declaration occurs when the Governor of the affected state requests federal assistance because a severe event exceeds the response capabilities and resources of the local and state governments. A preliminary damage assessment (PDA) is completed by jurisdictional officials to estimate the magnitude of the impact the disaster caused upon communities. The PDA provides supporting documentation that federal assistance is necessary for a specific event. Table 3‐13 identifies all declared disasters in Middlesex County since 1991. The table includes additional incident information such as the type of event, the duration, and a brief description. The majority of incidents impact multiple counties and states, and therefore the incident dates account for the entire time interval the disaster event occurs (not only the time it impacted Middlesex County).43 Table 3‐13 FEMA‐Declared Disaster Events for Middlesex County (1991‐2018) FEMA Incident FEMA Date Incident Dates Incident Description Disaster Type Declared Number March 13, 2018 The third nor'easter to hit Massachusetts in a Nor'easter to three‐week timeframe, which produced up to 4379 7/19/2018 March 14, 2018 two feet of snow.

A qualitative vulnerability assessment for the purposes of this plan evaluated the natural hazard categories of flooding, severe weather, fire, earthquake, and invasive species in terms of the impacts to infrastructure, societal, and environmental assets to remain consistent with the MVP process. The assessment considers the exposure and sensitivity of an asset to the natural hazards to determine the vulnerability. The World Bank1 defines these terms as:  Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, infrastructure, species or ecosystems, environmental services and resources, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places that could be adversely affected by a hazard.  Sensitivity: The degree to which a system, asset, or species may be affected, either adversely or beneficially, when exposed to climate variability or change or geophysical hazards.  Vulnerability: The potential effects of hazards on human or natural assets and systems. These potential effects, which are determined by both exposure and sensitivity, may be beneficial or harmful. The feedback from the MVP workshops, the June 21, 2018 public meeting, and the September 25, 2018 regional stakeholder meeting have been incorporated into the findings in the Vulnerability Assessment in Appendix B. The findings are summarized below for each asset category by natural hazard, discussing the highest priority hazards first, then other hazard types. In addition, this section presents the results of a risk model used to evaluate vulnerability and also describes areas of Melrose that have been historically subject to multiple loss claims. 4.2 Priority Vulnerabilities in Melrose Flooding and severe weather have been identified as priority hazards in Melrose through the public input process outlined in Section 2. The City has faced these hazards in the past like other Massachusetts communities, including flooding from the Mother’s Day storm in 2006, overwhelming snowfall totals during the winter of 2015, and most recently impacts from the nor’easter events in January and March 2018. During the second of three March 2018 storms, Melrose City Hall lost power, which disabled the phone lines to emergency responders. These are examples of specific vulnerabilities that have already been caused by flooding and severe weather in Melrose. 1 Source: World Bank: https://climatescreeningtools.worldbank.org/content/key‐terms‐0 4‐1Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment The vulnerabilities these natural hazards cause to society, infrastructure, and the environment are summarized below; in many cases, the impacts are similar for fires and earthquakes as noted. The full details may be found in the Vulnerability Assessment in Appendix B. 4.2.1 Societal Vulnerability due to Flooding and Severe Weather The following is a summary of the societal asset vulnerabilities in Melrose due to flooding and severe weather:  Emergency Management Planning: The City of Melrose maintains emergency response and evacuation plans that emergency response personnel follow in the event of a natural disaster. Outdated emergency and evacuation plans that do not take into account increased frequency and intensity of climate change related natural disasters pose a risk to public health and safety.  Senior / Aging Population: The senior/aging populations may have impaired mobility, diminished sensory awareness, chronic illness, and/or other social and economic limitations that make them particularly vulnerable to natural hazards. Power outages resulting from flood, severe weather, or earthquake events could cause inadequate indoor heating or air conditioning (A/C) as well as potential loss of important medical technologies and life‐support equipment. Loss of communication with public safety personnel during emergency events also presents immediate danger to the senior/aging population, whether they are in their own homes or in senior housing. Maintaining power and communication with emergency personnel, as well as providing access to emergency relief resources such as food, water, medical supplies, and transportation to nearby shelters or hospitals are important components of keeping senior populations safe during an emergency.  Chronically Ill / Disabled Population: Chronically ill and disabled populations are particularly vulnerable to flooding and severe weather events as limited mobility, diminished sensory awareness, and/or reliance on medical equipment hinders their ability to seek shelter and stay safe during a natural disaster. This would include, but not be limited to, the mentally ill, pregnant women, and the physically disabled. Power outages resulting from natural disasters could cause inadequate indoor heating or A/C as well as the potential loss of important medical technologies and life‐support equipment.  Non‐English Speaking Population: The inability to communicate or understand relevant emergency response or health and safety information puts the non‐English speaking population at greater risk of life threatening circumstances during a natural hazard event.  Low‐Income Population: Low‐income populations in Melrose face additional challenges in the event of a natural disaster. Low‐income housing is generally less able to withstand disaster and may incur more damage than standard, newer homes, particularly during flood, severe weather, or earthquake events. Lower‐income populations may also lack access to personal transportation and communications and may not have adequate access to healthcare. In addition, low‐income populations may be less able to purchase and replace damaged goods and property and resupply food. In addition to the details outlined 4‐2Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment in Section 4.2.1, during extreme temperature events, low‐income populations may be unable to afford the cost of heating or cooling their homes.  Faith Based Organizations: Faith based organizations play an important societal role in Melrose, including in the event of a natural disaster. They have the potential to provide shelter and a safe refuge away from the chaos and destruction of natural hazard events. Due to the important role faith based organizations play in post‐disaster relief, ensuring accessibility and maintaining power and communication at such facilities is very important.  Pet Owners: During an emergency that requires evacuation from one's home, pet owners may be reluctant to leave if they cannot take their pets with them. Many shelters cannot accommodate pets and kennel capacity may be limited (or impacted by the same event that requires evacuation). People's reluctance to leave their pets may increase their vulnerability to acute events. 4.2.2 Infrastructure Vulnerability due to Flooding and Severe Weather The following is a summary of the infrastructure asset vulnerabilities in Melrose due to flooding and severe weather:  Transportation Infrastructure: Natural disasters such as floods, severe weather events, and earthquakes make transportation services and public transit systems vulnerable to damages and potential service delays or shut downs. Transportation infrastructure, including public transit systems, play an important role in pre and post disaster mitigation by providing evacuation route services to vulnerable populations before a disaster hits, by distributing emergency relief resources (food, supplies, medical personnel), and by safely mobilizing vulnerable populations to local shelters or hospitals post disaster. Roadways and parking lots throughout the City of Melrose are primarily vulnerable to flood or snow related road closures that would present emergency response and accessibility issues. Blocked roadways that prevent access to evacuation routes or that block routes to hospitals, utility infrastructure, and emergency response facilities are of greatest concern. Roadways and parking lots that are particularly vulnerable to flooding include Lebanon St at Sylvan St, Derby Road, the rail bridge at Melrose St., the City Hall parking lot, Grove St, and Geneva Road at Upham Street.  Residential and Commercial Properties: Residential and commercial properties throughout the City of Melrose are vulnerable to severe weather, floods, fire, and earthquake events. Properties that fall within flood prone areas are particularly vulnerable.  Fire and Police Stations: The fire and police stations in Melrose currently have a lack of back‐up power. Engines 2 and 3 do not have generators leaving these critical facilities vulnerable to power outages and communication losses during a severe storm, flood, or earthquake event. Police officers and firefighters offer important first response and rescue operations during an emergency. Power outages and loss of communication with such personnel could inhibit appropriate and timely response to those in need during a natural hazard event. 4‐3Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment  City Hall: Melrose City Hall serves as the hub for the City’s communications systems and has historically been home to the City’s Emergency Management Command Center. The server room in the Information Technology Department at City Hall contains equipment that runs the City’s phone systems for the Police and Fire Departments, along with the phones in City Hall and at most of the Melrose Public School buildings. Loss of communication with public safety personnel during emergency events presents immediate danger to public safety. Maintaining power at City Hall is of critical importance; it currently is particularly vulnerable due to the potential for power outages during flooding and severe weather events.  Emergency Shelters: Melrose Middle School and Memorial Hall serve as the City of Melrose's designated emergency shelter locations. Both buildings are particularly vulnerable to severe weather (especially extreme heat) and flood. Melrose Middle School is located in a flood prone area, and both emergency shelter locations are in urban areas that experience elevated surface temperatures. Access to adequate emergency relief supplies as well as controlled indoor temperatures and working communication systems at emergency shelters are critically important to public health and safety. Increased temperatures make access to adequate A/C at these shelter locations important.  Schools / Child Care Facilities: Schools and child care facilities are vulnerable to impacts associated with flooding, severe weather, earthquakes, or fire. Melrose High School and Melrose Middle School are at greater risk due to their being within the Ell Pond floodplain. Additionally, several schools including Melrose Middle School, Melrose High School, Lincoln Elementary School, Beebe School, and the Melrose Early Childhood Center are located in areas where elevated surface temperatures occur due to the heat island effect making access to adequate A/C more important. Maintaining communication with emergency personnel during a natural disaster is of critical importance for schools and child care facilities. In addition, Melrose schools are part of METCO, which allows children from Boston to attend Melrose Public Schools. Therefore, a disruption to the schools impacts children both in Melrose and regionally.  Melrose‐Wakefield Hospital: The Melrose‐Wakefield Hospital (MWH) is the only hospital facility in the City of Melrose. Centrally located, the hospital may be vulnerable to impacts from floods, severe weather, fire, and earthquakes. Power loss is the greatest risk to MWH associated with these natural hazards. Flooded roadways throughout the City and region have the potential to block transportation routes to the hospital as well.  Pharmacies: The availability of life saving medications and prescription drugs for vulnerable populations becomes of critical importance during a natural hazard event. In extreme circumstances, a severe storm, flood, fire, or earthquake could prevent the import of important medications to the local pharmacies in Melrose.  Gas Infrastructure: Gas transmission systems are primarily vulnerable to floods, severe weather and earthquake events. Significant flooding in areas with underground gas lines may lead to gas transmission system failures due to increased hydrostatic pressure. Erosion from severe storms or flood events may even expose buried gas lines leaving them vulnerable to damages from flowing debris and disruption of supporting materials. 4‐4Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment  Electrical / Power Infrastructure: Power lines and electrical substations are particularly vulnerable to floods, severe weather, earthquakes, and fire. High wind from severe storms and ground movement from earthquakes could cause downed power lines while extreme heat or drought conditions increase the likelihood of wildfires that may impact power lines or electrical substations. Electrical services for Melrose are provided by National Grid.  Fuel Sources: Preparation for and mitigation of natural disasters are largely dependent on access to sufficient fuel sources, such as gasoline and diesel. Public preparedness for natural hazards such as severe storms and floods includes the acquisition and storage of propane, gasoline, or diesel for transportation vehicles in case there are long‐term power outages.  Food Sources: Preparation and mitigation of natural disasters are largely dependent on access to sufficient food sources. This would include grocery stores, community gardens, or partnerships with regional farms. Public preparedness for natural hazards such as severe storms and floods includes the acquisition and storage of non‐perishable food and water in case there are long‐term power outages.  Communications Infrastructure: Properly working communication and information technology systems are of fundamental importance during an emergency event. Failure of these systems during a flood, severe weather event, or earthquake presents an immediate threat to public safety. Melrose relies on the City of Melrose IT Department, as well as Verizon and Comcast, to maintain communication pathways and IT systems during a natural hazard event.  Sewer Pumping Stations: Sewer pumping stations are facilities that pump wastewater from low lying areas to higher elevations and eventually to the wastewater treatment plant where the water is treated before being discharged back into the environment. The five sewer pumping stations in the City of Melrose are at risk of power loss during flooding, severe weather, or earthquake events. Lift stations on Union Street by the middle school and high school and on the Lynn Fells Parkway in a residential area, are located in or near a 1% annual chance flood prone area and are at greater risk of failure due to flooding. The consequences of failure at the two larger lift stations (on the Lynn Fells Parkway and Upham Street) are of particular concern. Power loss and flooding of sewer pumping stations could cause significant sewer system outages and lead to sewer line backups and spills in localized areas that could pose a potential health and safety hazard to the public and the environment. The cost of cleanup and repair of sewer system pumping stations could be substantial.  Water Pumping Stations: Melrose has two water booster stations to serve the “high service” neighborhoods. Both stations are in the good repair and have emergency back‐up pumps in the event of failure of the main pumps or a need for additional pressure during a fire or other high water use event. These stations are critical facilities to fight fires in the high service neighborhoods.  Water and Sewer Pipelines: Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) provides drinking water and sanitary sewer services for the City of Melrose; water and sewer 4‐5Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment pipelines are owned and maintained by both the MWRA (transmission lines and interceptors) and the City (local water and sewer mains). Loss of clean drinking water and functioning sewer systems presents a significant danger to public health and the environment. Areas at greater risk of failure during a severe storm or flooding event include sanitary sewer overflows off Melrose Street next to Melrose High School, as well as off Grove Street, Tremont Street, Sylvan Street, and Melrose Towers.  Stormwater Drainage Infrastructure: Stormwater drainage issues have the potential to cause significant flooding and damage to impacted areas. Debris from a storm event could clog storm drains and cause water to back‐up with no place to drain. Furthermore, downstream drainage channels, both covered and open channels, must be kept clean in order to pass the large volumes of water resulting during storm events. Areas of concern include Geneva Road at Upham Street as well as the outfall and related upstream piping at Wyoming Cemetery. 4.2.3 Environmental Vulnerability due to Flooding and Severe Weather The following is a summary of the environmental asset vulnerability in Melrose due to flooding and severe weather; note that air quality is only impacted by severe weather (extreme hot temperatures) and not by flooding:  Water Bodies: Lakes/Rivers/Reservoirs: Water‐bodies such as lakes, rivers, and reservoirs act as mechanisms of storm flow transmission and storage during flood or severe weather events. Drainage systems and flood management measures are designed to convey stormwater runoff to area waterways or floodplains. These measures help to minimize the potential for flooding in more populated areas that could cause significant structural damage or pose a risk to public safety. However, due to the stress imposed on water bodies from rapid flow increases or physical forces in the event of a severe storm, flood, or earthquake, erosion, landslides, and dam failures could be potential consequences. Drainage issues may result in the blockage and back‐up of stormwater flows that may ultimately impact nearby communities or structures. Specific areas of concern in Melrose include areas around Ell Pond, the DCR property at the downstream end of Ell Pond Brook, outlet structures at Swains Pond, and the connection between Towners Pond and Swains Pond. Additionally, if either the High Service Reservoir Earthen Dam or the Spot Pond Dam in the Town of Stoneham were to fail, approximately 60 million gallons of water would rush into the City of Melrose. Finally, extreme temperatures may adversely impact the natural habitat of native aquatic organisms.  Parks/Natural Areas/Open Space: Potential damages to parks and natural areas incurred from floods and severe storms could include downed trees, destroyed natural habitat, and diminished aesthetics. Extreme heat and periods of extended drought may also leave parks and natural areas more susceptible to fire and may adversely affect plant life. Invasive species also present a threat to native vegetation and wildlife. The primary parks in the City of Melrose include Melrose Common, Pine Banks Park, Conant Park, the Middlesex Fells Reservation, and the Mount Hood Golf Course. In addition, there are many acres of conservation land, with smaller neighborhood areas in the northern half of the City and 4‐6Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment more widespread conservation land in the southern half. Lastly, the City‐owned Wyoming Cemetery is a significant open space asset in the community.  Tree Canopy: Tree canopy is a measure of how much of the land surface is covered by tree leaves. Tree canopy is an important component of both urban and natural areas that provide shade, habitat, and aesthetic quality. Increased tree canopy also provides proven human health benefits such as improved cardiovascular, respiratory, and mental health. The tree canopy is vulnerable to all types of natural hazards ‐ severe storms, floods, fires, and earthquakes ‐ which may result in damaged and downed trees. Increasing the tree canopy also helps mitigate extreme heat impacts on natural habitats and reduces the heat island effect in urban areas.  Wildlife: Damage to parks and natural areas from floods, severe weather, earthquakes, or fires, could harm or displace native wildlife populations. Changes in wildlife populations could cause shifts in ecosystem structure and diminish biodiversity.  Air Quality: Temperature increases result in poor air quality which can impact public health and safety. On hot days, the level of air pollutants increases, making it difficult for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with respiratory illnesses to spend time outdoors. 4.3 Additional Vulnerabilities in Melrose As discussed in previous sections, fire, earthquake, and invasive species have varying degrees of likelihood of occurrence and impact in Melrose, however are included in this plan for completeness. Many of the vulnerabilities caused by these natural hazards are similar or the same as for flooding and severe weather. The impacts of these natural hazards on infrastructure, society, and the environment are summarized below. The full details may be found in the Vulnerability Assessment in Appendix B. 4.3.1 Vulnerability due to Fire A unique society vulnerability for fire relates to the Senior / Aging and Chronically Ill / Disabled populations in Melrose. They are particularly vulnerable to fire as limited mobility, diminished sensory awareness, and/or reliance on medical equipment hinders their ability to evacuate and stay safe during a natural disaster. Societal vulnerabilities for Emergency Management Planning, Non‐English Speaking Population, Low‐Income Population, Faith Based Organizations, and Pet Owners are the same as outlined in Section 4.2.1. Fire and Police Stations in Melrose have a unique infrastructure vulnerability in addition to the details outlined in Section 4.2.2; if these facilities are impacted by fire, it impacts the ability for emergency personnel in Melrose to respond to people's needs during fire events in the City. Infrastructure vulnerabilities for Residential and Commercial Properties, City Hall, Emergency Shelters, Schools/Child Care Facilities, Melrose‐Wakefield Hospital, Pharmacies, Fuel Sources, and Communications Infrastructure are the same as outlined in Section 4.2.2. 4‐7Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment For environmental vulnerabilities, Air Quality is adversely impacted by wildfire, which may be exacerbated due to extreme heat and drought conditions, in addition to the details outlined in Section 4.2.3. Environmental vulnerabilities for Parks/Natural Areas/Open Space, Tree Canopy, and Wildlife are the same as outlined in Section 4.2.3, with the added concerns of destruction of natural resources and the associated lengthy recovery due to fires. 4.3.2 Vulnerability due to Earthquake As with the societal vulnerabilities to fire, unique vulnerabilities for earthquakes relate to the Senior/Aging and Chronically Ill/Disabled populations in Melrose. They are particularly vulnerable due to limited mobility, diminished sensory awareness, and/or reliance on medical equipment that hinders their ability to evacuate and stay safe during a natural disaster. Societal vulnerabilities for Emergency Management Planning, Non‐English Speaking Population, Low‐Income Population, Faith Based Organizations, and Pet Owners are the same as outlined in Section 4.2.1. Earthquakes have the potential to cause wide‐scale Gas Infrastructure and Electrical/Power Infrastructure failure in addition to the details outlined in Section 4.2.2. Infrastructure vulnerabilities to earthquakes for Transportation Infrastructure, Residential and Commercial Properties, City Hall, Emergency Shelters, Schools/Child Care Facilities, Melrose‐Wakefield Hospital, Pharmacies, Fuel Sources, Communications Infrastructure, Sewer Pumping Stations, and Water and Sewer Pipelines are the same as outlined in Section 4.2.2. Environmental vulnerabilities to earthquakes for Water Bodies: Lakes/Rivers/Reservoirs, Tree Canopy, and Wildlife are the similar to those outlined in Section 4.2.3. 4.3.3 Vulnerability due to Invasive Species The following is a summary of the societal, infrastructure, and environmental vulnerabilities in Melrose due to invasive species:  Senior/Aging Population: The senior/aging populations are particularly susceptible to vector borne diseases making mosquito control an important preparation and mitigation measure as new and different species of mosquitos carrying disease migrate to the region. The Milano Senior Center and non‐profit organizations like Mystic Valley Elder Services are the primary entities that house and assist at risk senior populations in Melrose.  Food Sources: Some invasive species may impact locally grown produce at community and home gardens or regional farms.  Water Bodies: Lakes/Rivers/Reservoirs: The occurrence of invasive species and extreme temperatures may adversely impact the natural habitat of native aquatic organisms. Invasive plants, aquatic species, and animals could outcompete native organisms for food and/or shelter resulting in potential shifts in ecosystem structure and diminished biodiversity. Invasive insects such as some mosquito species may potentially spread disease. The ecosystems of the City’s ponds, including Ell Pond, Swains Pond, Towners Pond, and the ponds at the Mount Hood Golf Course would be of particular concern. 4‐8Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment  Parks/Natural Areas/Open Space: Invasive species also present a threat to native vegetation and wildlife. Invasive plants and animals could outcompete native organisms for food and/or shelter resulting in potential shifts in ecosystem structure and diminished biodiversity. Invasive insects such as some mosquito species may potentially spread disease.  Tree Canopy: As described above, the tree canopy is important in Melrose as it provides shade, habitat, aesthetic quality, and improved air quality and human health. Invasive species could potentially impact the health and density of native tree species.  Wildlife: Damage to parks and natural areas from invasive species could harm or displace native wildlife populations. Changes in wildlife populations could cause shifts in ecosystem structure and diminish biodiversity. 4.4 Impacts due to Disease Disease is a secondary effect resulting from other natural hazards discussed in this plan and is not considered a natural hazard itself. However, because the interplay between natural hazards and disease was an area of concern at the MVP workshops and during the June 21, 2018 public meeting and has impacts on the people that live and work in Melrose, it is summarized below. 4.4.1 Flooding and Disease Flood waters can transport harmful and hazardous materials that have the potential to cause human health issues. Specifically, floods in urban areas may be contaminated with high levels of harmful pathogens or chemical compounds originating from sewer overflows or nearby wastewater or industrial facilities. Exposure to such contaminants could cause short term gastrointestinal illness or other health concerns. Standing water and moist conditions following a flood event also have the potential to attract disease bearing insects like mosquitos. Mosquitos are vectors for the spread of diseases like H1N1, Zika, and other infectious diseases. 4.4.2 Extreme Temperatures and Disease Extreme heat has the potential to cause heat stress related illnesses including heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke. Workers exposed to extreme heat are at the greatest risk for heat related illness, as well as other high‐risk groups like the elderly or young children. Additionally, high heat conditions adversely impact air quality by increasing ground‐level ozone, or “smog” levels. Hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide pollution from things like vehicles and power plants combine with sunlight and heat resulting in elevated levels of air pollution on hot, sunny days. High smog levels can impact the elderly, infants, or individuals with existing respiratory illnesses like asthma and limit the amount of time they can safely stay outdoors. Additionally, changes in atmospheric conditions may favor the proliferation of particular disease‐causing pathogens or, as noted above, vectors which carry these pathogens. The potential to develop a cold stress related illness like frostbite is measured based on wind chill temperatures using the Wind Chill Temperature Index, which is shown in Table 4‐1. 4‐9Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment Table 4‐1 Wind Chill Temperature Index and Frostbite Risk2 10 27 21 15 -4 -22 =47 -53 -59 -66 -72 15 25 19 13 -7 19 -26 -51 -58 -64 -71 -77 20 24 17 11 4 -2 -9 -22 -29 -ss -61 -68 -74 -81 :.c 25 23 16 9 3 -4 -11 -24 -31 -37 -44 -51 -58 -64 -71 -78 -84 Q. ! 30 22 15 8 1 -s -12 19 -26 -33 -39 -46 -53 -60 -67 -73 -80 -87 'ti 35 21 14 7 0 -7 -21 -27 -34 -41 -48 -55 -62 -69 -76 -82 -89 C ~ 40 20 13 6 -1 -8 -22 -29 -36 -43 -so -57 -64 -71 -78 -84 -91 45 19 12 s ·2 ·9 ·23 -30 -37 -44 ·Sl ·58 •65 .72 .79 ·86 .93 so 19 12 4 -3 -10 -31 -38 -45 -52 -60 -67 -74 -81 -88 -95 55 18 -3 -39 -46 -54 -61 -68 -75 -82 -89 -97 60 -40 -48 -ss -62 -69 -76 -84 -91 -98 Iii D L] Frostbite Times 30 mlnuto1 10mlnut•s Smlnute1 Wind Chill (°F) = 35.74 + 0.621 ST -35.75(V°·16 ) + 0.4275T(V°·16 ) Where, T= Air Temperature (•FJ V= Wind Speed (mph) Ellrcti'H I 1/01/01 4.4.3 Fire and Disease Smoke and air pollution resulting from urban or wildfires could pose a health risk to sensitive populations including children, the elderly, and those with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Firefighters and first responders would also be at a greater risk when on the site of a fire. Smoke from wildfires contains emissions that include soot, tar, water vapor, minerals, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, formaldehyde, and benzene – all of which can have harmful health impacts if inhaled. 4.4.4 Other Disease Vulnerabilities Another disease risk from natural hazards is in the aftermath of a major natural disaster, when populations may not have access to clean, safe drinking water, proper nourishment, and hygienic living conditions. All types of natural hazards that may result in the need for emergency shelter use or that may impact the continued provision basic infrastructure services must be considered in relation to their potential to result in the spread of disease, especially to more vulnerable populations. Access to healthcare facilities, personnel, and medications may also be impeded during and after a major hazard event. 2 NWS Wind Chill/Temperature Index. Website accessed 08/14/18 https://www.weather.gov/oun/safety‐ winter‐windchill 4‐10Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment 4.5 Loss Estimates Part of the vulnerability assessment presented herein is evaluating the potential monetary losses that may result from natural hazards. Identifying and understanding the potential losses allow Melrose to further evaluate and prioritize where hazard mitigation projects may be of most use. For this plan, the losses were evaluated for flooding, hurricanes (wind damage), and earthquakes using a HAZUS model, as well as reviewing historical multiple loss properties in Melrose due to flooding. 4.5.1 HAZUS Methodology, Data Inputs, Assumptions, and Results Hazards United States (HAZUS) is a natural hazard analysis tool developed by FEMA and the National Institute of Building Science (NIBS). The software package uses geographic information system (GIS) technology to calculate loss estimates and risk assessments. HAZUS estimates the cost of physical damage to buildings and contents due to floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis. High‐risk locations due to these natural hazards are identified and geographically represented for users to visualize the spatial relationships between populations and other fixed geographic assets or resources. The results generated by HAZUS are used by federal, state, regional and local governments and private enterprises to help communities make informed resource expenditure decisions related to disaster mitigation and preparedness. There are two analysis scenarios in HAZUS for hazard events: 1) probabilistic analysis or 2) deterministic analysis. The probabilistic analysis estimates average annual losses based on the probability of multiple events occurring during specific time periods; this means the loss estimate can be higher or lower in a given year. It also evaluates the statistical likelihood that a given event will occur. Since this plan incorporates the effects of climate change ‐ which impact the probability of flooding and hurricane events ‐ it was determined that the probabilistic analysis did not fit the needs of the plan. Therefore, the deterministic analysis was used, which evaluates losses based on specific events and does not evaluate the frequency or probability of the event. It gives a worst‐case scenario of losses due to a natural hazard event. 4.5.1.1 HAZUS Flood Model The HAZUS Flood Model is an integrated system for identifying and quantifying flood risks based on the Multi‐Hazard Loss Estimation Methodology Flood Model. The HAZUS Flood Model methodology can be dissected into two processes: 1) the flood hazard analysis and 2) the flood loss estimation analysis. Frequency, discharge, and ground elevation are used to model the spatial variation in flood depth and velocity in the flood hazard analysis phase. In the loss estimation phases, vulnerability curves and the results of the flood hazard analysis are used to calculate structural and economic damage.3 HAZUS has two flood designations to choose from – coastal or riverine flood hazards. To estimate flood losses in Melrose, the riverine flood hazard designation was selected, which is used for non‐ coastal areas. Flood hazard is defined by the relationship between the depth of flooding and the 3 Multi‐hazard Loss Estimation Methodology Flood Model. Website accessed on 9/15/18; https://www.fema.gov/media‐library‐data/20130726‐1820‐25045‐8292/hzmh2_1_fl_tm.pdf 4‐11Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment annual chance of inundation to that depth.4 In addition to the hazard designation, flood magnitude was also specified as an input within the HAZUS Flood Model. The FEMA 100‐year and 500‐year floodplains5 were examined in this analysis, including use of the recently updated flood elevations for the Ell Pond watershed. A total of six sets of flood model results were compared using each of the following methods of calculating the flood elevations for both the 100‐year and 500‐year floods: 1) Default Data, 2) FEMA’s Effective Data, and 3) User Defined Facilities (UDF) with FEMA’s effective data. Each of these categories is described below: 1. Default Data: 100‐ and 500‐year floodplains are developed using elevation data and the default HAZUS flood model. HAZUS‐generated flooding extent and depth is compared to default inventory data to create a loss estimate. 2. FEMA Effective Data: FEMA effective 100‐ and 500‐year floodplains are compared to default inventory data to create a loss estimate. 3. User Defined Facilities: City‐supplied data replaces the default inventory. FEMA effective 100‐ and 500‐year floodplains are compared to local inventory data to create a loss estimate. Note that FEMA’s effective data for 500‐year flood zones are only captured in detailed study areas. In an actual 500‐year flood event, it is expected that the areas in the 100‐year flood zone would also experience losses. 4.5.1.2 HAZUS Hurricane Model The HAZUS Hurricane Model is used to estimate losses from hurricane winds and storm surge. For this plan, only wind effects from hurricanes were evaluated and not the potential storm surge flooding, given the distance from the coast. Inland flooding effects are captured in the flood module. The Hurricane Model uses a default terrain roughness founded on digitized Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data. Ground roughness is a critical component for the modeling of wind effects, damage, and losses to buildings.6 The rougher the ground surface becomes, the wind speeds near the ground decrease, while the upper level wind speeds remain the same. For example, a typical suburban or urban environment with trees experiences lower wind loads on structures than those experienced by buildings located in unobstructed regions such as waterfronts and open fields. HAZUS contains a database of historical hurricanes. For this plan, the 1938 New England Hurricane was modeled with the default census data (tracts) for the inventory. The 1938 hurricane can be considered a worst‐case scenario for the region (based on historical storms). It 4 HAZUS Flood Model User Guidance.

While the storm center traveled roughly along the Connecticut River, about 80 miles west of Melrose, the damages within the city modeled with HAZUS were significant. 4.5.1.3 HAZUS Earthquake Model As with the HAZUS Hurricane Model, the HAZUS Earthquake Model is a tool within HAZUS that generates results based on a database of historical earthquakes, which can be used to show the projected impact of a similar earthquake today. The 1755 earthquake was selected as the input scenario for this plan. Its epicenter was approximately 25 miles east‐north‐east of Cape Ann, MA, and it was an estimated 5.9 magnitude earthquake. Note that a limitation of the Earthquake Model is that the methodology does not have the capacity to calculate the additional damage or loss due to flooding or fire that could potentially occur as a result of an earthquake.7 4.5.1.4 HAZUS Results The HAZUS results show the total loss by census block for flooding and by census tract for hurricane and earthquake. Census blocks are the smallest entity for which the U.S. Census Bureau collects information. Typically, a census block is the equivalent of a city block bounded by streets on all sides. Block groups are made up of an average of 40 census blocks and typically contain between 600 and 3,000 people. Census tracts generally contain 1,500 to 8,000 people and are made up of on average four block groups. The total losses for each of the six flooding scenarios show that the values are decreasing with each additional level of detail (i.e., the Default Data predicts the highest losses while the UDF predicts the lowest). The 100‐year and 500‐year UDF scenarios are showing the lowest total losses, likely because the analysis is only pulling parcels that intersect the floodplain, whereas the other flooding scenarios aggregated the default census data at the block level, which likely over estimates losses. These results are shown in Figures 4‐1 to 4‐6. Table 4‐2 distinguishes between 500‐year total losses and additional 100‐year losses because the FEMA 500‐year flood zones are only captured in detailed study areas. In an actual 500‐year flood event, it is expected that the areas in the 100‐year flood zone would also experience losses. Hurricane and earthquake results can also be found in Table 4‐2, Figure 4‐7, and Figure 4‐8. 7 Multi‐hazard Loss Estimation Methodology Earthquake Model.

These areas are outside of the 100‐year and 500‐year floodplains, which indicates the flooding is likely due to stormwater drainage challenges. These areas are expected to continue to experience flooding if no hazard mitigation action is taken, especially with the expected changes in precipitation extremes due to climate change. To estimate the approximate extent of flooding, elevation data and GIS hydrology tools were used to model corresponding flooding at these drainage issue areas. Each issue point was analyzed by intersecting parcels with the cloudburst depth grid8 and calculating the total building assessed value for all parcels. These assessed building values do not accurately represent the damage from a flooding event but provide some insight to what may be damaged. Note that the Wyoming Cemetery outfall (4), Swain’s Pond outlet (5), and connection between Towners Pond and Swain’s Pond (6) do not have estimated building values because there are not any buildings within those parcels, or the parcel Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) database did not contain prior year building assessed value. However, the flooding at Lebanon Street and Sylvan Street (7) is directly caused by issues at the Wyoming Cemetery outfall.

Severe Repetitive Loss Properties are residential properties with four or more NFIP claim payments of more than $5,000 each, with at least two of those payments occurring in a 10‐year period, and with the total claims paid exceeding $20,000, or two or more claim payments that cumulatively exceeded the building’s value. FEMA reports that a total of 11 properties in Melrose are considered Repetitive Loss Properties, one of which is also a Severe Repetitive Loss Property. Details regarding these properties such as the exact addresses, number of losses per addresses, and claim amount per address are privileged and confidential information to protect the privacy of the owners. Reviewing this information in terms of the areas where these repetitive losses have occurred, as opposed to exact location, helps to inform the community of the areas where hazard mitigation assistance may be most warranted to prevent losses in the future, recognizing that additional properties may have also experienced repetitive losses, but did not necessarily have a flood insurance policy through the NFIP. Table 4‐4 and Figure 4‐10 present a high‐level summary of the total number of claims and amounts paid by drainage area to demonstrate the areas within Melrose that are impacted by repetitive losses.

These areas have been reviewed and reevaluated as part of this process; areas that continue to be of concern in Melrose are listed below. Although these hazard areas are also susceptible to high winds and other natural hazards, the flooding in these areas has been determined to be the primary cause of risk to the community. In many of these areas, opportunities exist to modify or upgrade the City’s stormwater collection and transport systems to minimize current flooding problems. A description of each high flood hazard area is presented in the following sections along with some potential causes and mitigation measures. Each of these frequent flooding areas requires a more detailed engineering evaluation, beyond the scope of this study, to responsibly evaluate the cause and potential alternatives essential for more thorough mitigation recommendations. Figure 5‐1 shows the flood hazard regions which includes the one percent and 0.2 percent chance annual flood hazard areas and areas in Melrose prone to flooding. It also locates and identifies critical facilities in Melrose, including:  Police and fire stations  Emergency shelters and emergency generators  City Hall and the historic district  Water and wastewater pumping stations  The Melrose‐Wakefield hospital  Schools and libraries  Affordable housing  Long term care facilities Each flood hazard area is described in detail below. 5‐1Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions \" 1,,;r..nuJl STO~CIU\\1 -· \\ \\ •ll \\ \\ .. b:_:---:_~i-i ~ =-· ,; // . . :_.\\ C,,) / j l. i!J,• . .,,. ,.- I I ~-· · ·1· -,:--.

There were also smaller portions of this area that experienced shallow flooding during a 100‐year and 500‐year flood in accordance with FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps. In general, a rainstorm with 3 to 4 inches of total rainfall used to result in significant flooding around Ell Pond. Ell Pond receives flow from a large total drainage area including areas located adjacent to Ell Pond and flows from streams and culverts transporting flow from both Stoneham and Wakefield. Flow discharges from Ell Pond through an outlet located at the southeast corner of the Pond. Following the 2004 NHMP, the City, with assistance from FEMA, installed a new outlet from Ell Pond along with a crest gate that added flexibility in the ability to manipulate the pond’s surface elevation. Both the new Ell Pond Drain and the prior discharge outlet transport water southward within or adjacent to Main Street. These flows eventually discharge near the Wyoming Hill commuter rail station to an open channel known as Lower Spot Pond Brook. The flows continue southward within Lower Spot Pond Brook through Malden and eventually reach a location upstream of the Amelia Earhart Dam located on the Mystic River in Boston. As the issues surrounding Ell Pond were the most significant natural hazard within the City, solutions were immediately sought and implemented after completion of the 2004 report. While the solutions implemented have been very successful, large rain events with increasing volumes and intensities can still cause some degree of flooding in the vicinity of Ell Pond, as shown by the newly adopted floodplain elevations shown on Figure 5‐1. Therefore, this area was maintained in this report as a focus area for monitoring potential future flooding impacts. 5.1.1.1 The Towers and Other Ell Pond Area Properties Prior to the improvements described above to the Ell Pond outlet, the Towers, a residential high‐ rise located northeast of Ell Pond, experienced shallow flooding in the lower level parking area approximately every six months. Deeper flood waters totaling several feet in depth were also experienced within the parking garage about every other year. Other structures located in this flood hazard area include the Melrose High School and Melrose Veteran’s Memorial Middle School campus, businesses, the Elmhurst Nursing Home, the Melrose DPW City Yard, and residential houses. While flooding in these areas has substantially improved as a result of the new Ell Pond outlet and crest gate installation, some issues still exist during large storms. One issue of note is wastewater backups that sometimes impact homes on Melrose Street when infiltration and inflow into the City’s sewer system cause capacity restrictions within the City’s sewer mains that run beneath the school campus. This issue relates to both the intensity of storm events and deficiencies in the City’s sewer infrastructure. 5.1.1.2 Roosevelt School Athletic Fields When the 2004 NHMP was developed, the athletic fields located behind the Roosevelt Elementary School on Vinton Street experienced flooding about four times per year. Since that time, the detention basin at the school has been improved, which has minimized flooding. These improvements have largely mitigated the associated flooding issues; however, their success is predicated on keeping the stormwater grate adjacent to the school clear of debris. Furthermore, improvements are recommended to the City’s drainage system where it runs from Vinton Street, 5‐3Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions beneath the railroad tracks, through the property of a current auto body shop, discharging to Tremont Street (referred to herein as the “Tremont Street Drain”). This drainage pipe creates a bottleneck that sometimes results in backups onto the Roosevelt School property. The City should prioritize keeping the drainage grate clear and ensuring that it is accessible for periodic cleaning throughout the year. In addition, the Tremont Street Drain should be further evaluated to determine if improvements are feasible. 5.1.1.3 Melrose Street This small, community defined flood area is limited to the area beneath the Boston and Maine Railroad “overpass” bridge that crosses Melrose Street. The cause of this flooding may be due to a combination of the low lying ground surface in this area and the flooding in the Ell Pond area. As explained previously, flooding in this neighborhood creates surcharge conditions in the subsurface culvert passing through the Roosevelt School property. The drainage system in the Melrose Street area discharges to the same culvert at a location adjacent to the Boston and Maine Railroad. Previously, sewer backups within the MWRA transmission mains in this vicinity were also an issue during storm events. In response to this issue, the MWRA constructed a second transmission main in this area. As a mitigation measure to minimize capacity restrictions, the MWRA brings a bypass pump to Melrose Street when large storms are expected and pumps flow from one main into the other to equalize flows and minimize the risk of sewer overflows or backups. 5.1.2 Downtown Flood Hazard Region The City of Melrose downtown district is located just south of Ell Pond. In 2004, three flood hazard areas were identified in this region: Felton Place, the Synagogue area, and the City Hall parking lot. The improvements to the Ell Pond outlet have resolved the flooding issues at the first two sites, having relieved the older granite Ell Pond outlet culvert of its capacity restrictions by providing a parallel outlet drain. The City Hall parking lot continues to be an area of concern. 5.1.2.1 City Hall Parking Lot The parking lot behind City Hall experiences flooding about four times per year. The catch basins and storm drainage that collect the storm water runoff from the parking lot discharges to the Ell Pond effluent culvert at a location near Felton Place. It is possible that surcharged water levels in the granite culvert near Felton Place cause the City Hall parking lot to surcharge above the elevation of the parking lot. However, with the other related flood areas having been alleviated by the installation of the new Ell Pond outlet, the problems causing the parking lot to flood may be more localized. It has been reported that the storm drains in the parking lot are pitched backwards, potentially exacerbating the flood problem. Typical flooding in this area is shallow and limited to the parking lot area. However, it is sometimes significant enough that cars need to be relocated to avoid damage. The 2004 Community Team reported that one flood reached the roof level of cars parked in the lot, although this was prior to the Ell Pond outlet improvements. 5‐4Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions The Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall is a critical facility located adjacent to the City Hall Parking lot that has been affected at times by the flooding in this area. 5.1.3 Lower Spot Pond Brook Flood Hazard Region As explained previously, discharge from Ell Pond eventually flows to a large earthen open channel known as Lower Spot Pond Brook, running parallel to the Boston & Maine Railroad tracks on the southern end of Melrose. The 2004 Community Team identified a relationship between the operation of the Amelia Earhart dam/pump station (located miles downstream in Boston) and the water level in the Lower Spot Pond Brook. It is believed that the operation of the dam includes free discharge of flow into Boston Harbor when the Harbor level is within non‐storm surge conditions. The combination of damming and pumping of the flow to Boston Harbor occurs when the Harbor levels become surcharged during storm surge conditions. It is believed that the upstream water level of the dam during pumping creates a downstream water level that results in surcharge several miles upstream within the Lower Spot Pond Brook. This surcharge is believed to be to an elevation that impacts the capacity of the storm drainage systems located adjacent to the Brook resulting in flooding in each area. It is not known whether flow within the Brook backflows through any of the storm drainage systems to the flood areas. The Derby Road and Main Street/Sylvan Street hazard areas described below were identified by the 2004 Community Team as being at least partially the result of surcharge levels in Lower Spot Pond Brook. These areas have also been noted more recently as priority areas for keeping catch basins clean, to ensure unrestricted localized flow during storm events. A third area in this region, Converse Lane, had also been identified in 2004 as having flooding problems. Drainage improvements have since been made to the Converse Lane neighborhood to alleviate flooding, therefore it is no longer included herein. 5.1.3.1 Derby Road This older neighborhood located to the east of Lower Spot Pond Brook was reported in 2004 to experience flooding six to ten times per year. The storm drain system in this neighborhood discharges directly to Lower Spot Pond Brook. It is believed that as the Brook surcharges due to downstream conditions, the storm drainage system in the Derby Road area surcharges above the roadway level before the capacity required to transport the local runoff is achieved. This results in basement, yard, and street flooding. To respond to frequent complaints from residents, the Melrose Public Works Department continues to clean the storm drains and catch basins in this area two to three times per year. The continued flooding that occurs even after the cleaning has been performed indicates the flood problem is due to the hydraulic deficiencies of the storm drainage in this area. 5.1.3.2 Main Street/Sylvan Street Another 2004 Community Team defined flood hazard area is located directly south of the Derby Road flood hazard area. Basement, yard, and street flooding occur here almost every other month, especially at the intersection of Main Street and Sylvan Street. The Community Team believed the flooding in this area has similar origin to the Derby Road area in that the storm drainage system 5‐5Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions that discharges directly to Lower Spot Pond Brook has inadequate capacity when surcharge occurs in Lower Spot Pond Brook. 5.1.3.3 Boston Rock Road Small, local flooding was reported in 2004 to occur off of Boston Rock Road about four times per year. The flooding is limited to a handful of houses on Boston Rock Road and is a direct result of surcharge in the storm drain located within Boston Rock Road. It appears that this flood hazard area is caused by a combination of undersized drain piping and the low ground surface elevation within this area. 5.1.4 South Washington Street Flood Hazard Area This flood hazard area located between the Middlesex Fells Reservation to the west and Lower Spot Pond Brook to the east was reported in 2004 as experiencing flooding about three times per year. It is believed that the flooding is caused by a blockage of the inlet structure, commonly referred to as the “trash grate,” located at the boundary between Melrose and Malden. This inlet structure is within the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), and the flooding is due to inadequate frequency of cleaning of the structure. This grate is often blocked with debris that washes out from the wooded area adjacent to it during storm runoff conditions. The flooding typically requires the closing of one lane of traffic on South Washington Street and also floods adjacent parking lots. The City is continuing to work with the DCR to ensure that routine cleaning of the grate is performed. 5.1.5 Wyoming Cemetery Flood Hazard Region Several identified flood hazard areas are located along a route of culverts that transport storm water from the area adjacent to Wyoming Cemetery, through the Cemetery, to a brook located within Pine Banks Park, where it flows into Malden. The following three flood hazard areas have been identified within this region. 5.1.5.1 Pine Banks Park Pine Banks Park is a densely wooded area located in the southwestern corner of the City of Melrose. It is believed that this area experiences shallow flooding similar to the FEMA designation for this area: 100‐year and 500‐year shallow flooding (less than one foot of depth). Flooding is limited to a portion of the park that is designated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a wetland area. 5.1.5.2 Cemetery The flooding within Wyoming Cemetery is identified by FEMA to be within a 100‐year and 500‐ year shallow flood zone (less than one foot of depth). The 2004 Community Team indicated a flood frequency of about six times per year within this area. Flooding has also been observed and reported in recent years. The flooding is caused by deficiencies within the drainage pipes through the cemetery and the adjacent Pine Banks Park, as well as the downstream outfall. The pipes through the cemetery do not have adequate pitch, and the outfall frequently has sediment deposits that back up at the outlet and restrict flow. Although the flooding within the cemetery is frequent, it is shallow and has little resulting impact because there are no buildings within this 5‐6Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions area. The main significance of the Cemetery flood area is the impact this flooding has on the upstream Sylvan Street flood area described below. 5.1.5.3 Sylvan Street This flood hazard area is located adjacent to the northeast corner of Wyoming Cemetery and was reported in 2004 as flooding about six times per year. The storm drain system on Sylvan Street discharges through the Cemetery flood hazard area and typically floods during the same storm events as the Cemetery area. In the last two years, the City has performed extensive study of the pipes from this neighborhood, through the cemetery, to the outfall, and has identified a number of deficiencies. A preliminary plan for replacement/relocation of the drainage infrastructure downstream of this area has been developed for implementation when funding becomes available. This area is also susceptible to sewer backups during storms, when infiltration and inflow overwhelm the adjacent sewer mains. This problem has exacerbated the impacts to the adjacent homes when combined with the stormwater flooding noted above. 5.1.6 Long Pond Flood Hazard Region Long Pond receives storm water flow from a variety of neighborhoods located in the eastern area of Melrose. The following flood hazard areas have been identified: Long Pond, Bow Street/Sycamore Road, and Burnett Street Flood Hazard Areas. While flooding in these areas has improved as drainage system improvement projects have been implemented, this area is still susceptible to some level of flooding and is one the City continues to watch during storm events. 5.1.6.1 Long Pond Long Pond is located on the eastern border of Melrose and is partly located within the adjacent Town of Saugus. The pond acts as a detention basin for storm water runoff from a large area of eastern Melrose. The 2004 Community Team indicated that the area around the Pond flooded only once every few years with minimal resulting impact due to its location in undeveloped land. Long Pond is partly located within the Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course. The Golf Course, although not specifically identified as a flood hazard area, was identified by the 2004 Community Team as an area that experiences flooding about once every two years. 5.1.6.2 Bow Street/Sycamore Road This residential neighborhood, located about ¼ of a mile east of Melrose Common, was reported as flooding about once per year in 2004. Catch basins located in low areas in the backyards of houses on Bow Street surcharge, resulting in significant yard and basement/structural flooding especially between Bow Street and Slayton Road. It is believed that flooding in this area is due to surcharge conditions in a subsurface culvert running between Bow Street and Slayton Street, possibly resulting from the downstream water level in the Long Pond area. Homes at the end of Laurel Street are also sometimes impacted by flooding in this area. Mitigation of this flooding is assisted by routine maintenance of the open 5‐7Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions channels downstream of the drainage in these neighborhoods, within the Mount Hood Golf Course. 5.1.6.3 Burnett Street The Burnett Street flood hazard area, located adjacent to the Bow Street area, was reported in 2004 to experience flooding about once a year, typically concurrent with flooding in the Bow Street area. The 2004 Community Team decided to distinguish this flood area separately from the adjacent Bow Street area because the extent and magnitude of the flooding in the Burnett area had been significantly mitigated prior to the 2004 NHMP, through a recently constructed detention pond located on the 1st hole of the Mount Hood Golf Course southeast of the Burnett Street area. The new storage within this basin appears to dampen out the peak flow of storm water runoff that the Golf Course previously contributed to the Burnett Street area. Since the basin was constructed, only small scale basement flooding in a few homes has occurred in this area about once per year. 5.1.7 Ashburton Place Flood Hazard Area The Steele House senior center and a residential area located in the northwest corner of the Melrose Highlands (in northern Melrose) was reported in 2004 to experience flooding about once every nine months. Flooding of basements, yards, and parking lots is common in this area and the Steele House, a critical facility, has required evacuation on at least one occasion. When flooding does occur, shallow water of 1 to 2 inches in depth appears within parking lots in this area. 5.2 Other Flood Hazard Area Profiles In order to address all of the known flood hazard areas affecting the City, this subsection presents additional flood hazard areas that were either established by the 2004 Community Team or were identified by FEMA as located within the 100‐year floodplain. Each of these delineated geographic areas has been determined to be at some level of risk for a future flood event; however, the level of risk to community assets is considered to be less than for those flood hazard areas presented above. 5.2.1 Bellevue Golf Club Flood Hazard Region The area surrounding the Bellevue Golf Club, in the northeastern portion of the Melrose Highlands, has been defined by FEMA as being within the 100‐year floodplain. This area has been divided into the Carlida Road area and the Bellevue Golf Club area. 5.2.1.1 Carlida Road This neighborhood located north of Howard Street and adjacent to the border with Saugus has experienced stormwater flooding in the past, however flooding has not occurred in recent years including during 100‐year storm events. Homeowners in this flood hazard area, mainly on Windsor Street, have petitioned FEMA with Letters of Amendment (LOA) to request a revised delineation of the 100‐year floodplain in this area. Many of the residents in this area believe that their homes are not within the true 100‐year floodplain, even though their property is located within the 100‐year flood zone as defined on the 5‐8Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions current version of the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps. These residents believe that they should not be required to carry flood insurance for their properties. 5.2.1.2 Bellevue Golf Club The Bellevue Golf Course was reported in 2004 as experiencing flooding about four times per year. However, the neighborhoods associated with this flood hazard area on Rivers Lane and Lynn Fells Parkway only experience flooding about once every four years. Flooding within the golf course is believed to be attributed to an undersized surface culvert that transports flow from Wakefield and the Melrose Highlands through the Golf Course to Saugus. The Fellsway Wastewater Pump Station is a critical facility within this flood area that could experience damage or become disabled during a significant flood event in this area. The station is also susceptible to high flows during storm events due to inflow into the sewer system, which could result in sewer backups or overflows. 5.2.2 Swains Pond Avenue Flood Hazard Region The Swains Pond Avenue region of Melrose, located just to the west of the Mount Hood Golf Course, is sparsely developed and covered with woodlands and ponds. The following flood hazard areas have been identified within this region and have each been identified as having minimal impact to the community. 5.2.2.1 Swains Pond & Towners Pond Swains Pond and Towners Pond experience noticeable flooding about once every ten years. Although there was no experience by the 2004 Community Team of this flooding causing impacts to any structures, yards or streets, the defined 100‐year floodplain does encroach on houses located on Swains Pond Avenue and the paved roadway in two locations. The 2004 Community Team indicated that no complaints had been received from property owners in this area. A headwall structure at the outlet from Swains Pond was damaged during a winter storm in 2015 and requires replacement in the near term. 5.2.3 Lincoln Street Flood Hazard Area The Lincoln Street area located adjacent to the Lynn Fells Parkway and west of the Bellevue Golf Club has been determined as a flood hazard area that, in 2004, was reported to experience flooding about once every six months. The flooding historically experienced here was limited to the roadways and was the most severe at a low lying area of Lincoln Street. Members of the 2004 Community Team believed that the flooding on Lincoln Street may be mitigated with the construction of a few new catch basins within the low lying area of the street. Since that time, substantial drainage improvements (replacement and rerouting) have taken place in the neighborhoods of Stowecroft Road and Burrell Street, in this general vicinity. These improvements have mitigated backyard flooding issues on these streets. This area will continue to be watched during storm events, but the improvements in this area are believed to have alleviated the majority of the flooding in this neighborhood. 5‐9Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions 5.2.4 Conant Park/Martin Street Flood Hazard Area This flood hazard area contains two distinct sub‐areas; a residential area around Martin Street indicated by FEMA to be within the region of shallow flooding (less than one foot deep) during 100 and 500‐year flood frequencies, and a flood prone sub‐area mainly within Conant Park as indicated by the 2004 Community Team. The recurrence of flooding of the baseball fields located in Conant Park is about once a year, and the Martin Street area rarely (if ever) experiences flooding. This is still the case at this time. The Melrose Care Center is a critical facility located on Martin Street within the FEMA designated shallow flood area. 5.2.5 Bay State Road Flood Hazard Area The Bay State Road Flood Hazard Area, located in the northeast corner of the Melrose Highlands and adjacent to the Wakefield border, was reported in 2004 to experience flooding about once every two years. The flooding is mainly limited to undeveloped land, much of which is designated as a wetland resource area. The extent of flooding decreased significantly prior to 2004 following construction of a new drain within Damon Avenue to transport a higher capacity of flow southward within the collection system. A headwall structure was also replaced, where only a pipe previously existed. It is believed that the basement, yard and street flooding on Bay State Road and Damon Avenue experienced in the past have been eliminated by these improvements, but this area is still watched by the City during storm events. 5.3 Update on Identified Actions in the 2004 Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan The 2004 Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan identified 16 priority measures to reduce the risks posed by natural hazards. The City has completed five of these actions, has partially completed or is currently working on ten, and did not act on one. The status of these actions is listed in Table 5‐ 1 below. For those not completed, the actions are further summarized with details on the current status and are carried into the later sections of this report. 5‐10Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions Table 5‐1. Summary of the Status of 2004 Priority Mitigation Actions Priority Mitigation Actions  Reconstruct DPW Maintenance and Repair Garage (City Yard): This facility, located within the 100‐year flood area of Ell Pond at 72 Tremont Street, stores diesel fuel for the Fire, Police, School, Emergency Management and Public Works departments. Also, other hazardous materials such as oil, gasoline, solvents, etc. are stored here for both vehicle maintenance and emergency repair. The garage was to be reconstructed in a way to protect the active use of the garage during flood events (in Ell Pond) while avoiding hazardous contamination due to stored chemicals. Status: Partial Completion Action Update: The improvements to the outlet from Ell Pond have substantially decreased the frequency and magnitude of flooding within the Ell Pond watershed. This is reflected in the updated base flood elevation that was approved by FEMA on December 3, 2018. In addition, significant renovations have been made at the City Yard facility since 2004, and improvements have been made with regard to materials storage and organization such that operations have not been impeded in recent years by storm events. Since this facility is still within the 100‐year floodplain to Ell Pond, opportunities for further improvements will continue to be sought as maintenance and upgrade projects are undertaken within the facility.  Reconstruct Roosevelt School Detention Basin: This facility serves as the last detention basin prior to discharge of stormwater through the northwest tributary culvert to Ell Pond. 5‐11 etelpmoC laitraP noitelpmoC ssergorP nI noitcA oN Reconstruct DPW Maintenance and Repair Garage X Reconstruct Middle School/High School Drain X Reconstruct Roosevelt School Detention Basin X Study/Implement Mitigation Measures for the Melrose Towers Condos X Petition FEMA – include Converse Lane Community in 100‐year floodplain X Converse Lane Drainage Improvements X Reconstruct Upstream Portion of Tremont Street Drain X Study and Implement Mitigation Measures for Several Flood Hazard Areas X Official City of Melrose Website – Increase Public Outreach X Incident Command Course (ICS) X Portable Generators X Secure Important Records X Direct‐Connect for City Departments X Reverse 911 X Enroll in the Community Rating System X South Washington Street Trash Grate XSection 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions Several issues were identified in 2004 including the time of concentration that were believed to adversely impact flooding in the Ell Pond area. Also, it was acknowledged that wastewater overflows entered the detention basin and were then transported to Ell Pond through the northwest tributary culvert. There were also concerns for the safety of elementary school students at the Roosevelt School while the basin was holding water. Status: Partial Completion Action Update: The detention basin reconstruction has been completed. This area remains a location that requires routine maintenance. The City will continue to clean the grate that enters the drain beneath the railroad tracks and keep it accessible for routine maintenance.  Reconstruct Upstream Portion of Tremont Street Drain: The deteriorating 30‐inch corrugated metal (CM) pipe requires cleaning and lining. This segment of pipe is located upstream from the portions of the drain previously cleaned and lined or replaced with new 30‐inch reinforced concrete pipe. Status: Partial Completion Action Update: The downstream portion of the Tremont Street drain was rehabilitated, and the upstream portion has been cleaned. Rehabilitation of the bottleneck between Tremont Street and Vinton Street is still recommended, although other improvements in the Ell Pond watershed have lessened the overall impacts of flooding in this area. This project remains on the list of projects for completion.  Study and Implement Mitigation Measures for Several Flood Hazard Areas: In 2004, the NHMP recommended developing and implementing mitigation measures for flooding in the following flood hazard areas:  Derby Road  Main Street/Sylvan Street  Boston Rock Road  Sylvan Street  Wyoming Cemetery  Lincoln Street Status: In Progress Action Update: Several of these areas have been improved through minor improvements to the drainage system, along with increased frequency of routine maintenance such as catch basin and drain line cleaning. The City intends to continue with high frequency routine maintenance in the areas identified as benefiting from such work. At this time, the Wyoming Cemetery area and the related upstream flood hazard areas have been identified 5‐12Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions as the highest priority for infrastructure replacement of the flooding areas identified within Sections 5.1 and 5.2 above.  Official City of Melrose Website: Increase public outreach on the website (www.cityofmelrose.org) with links to mitigation activities from this plan, FEMA 100‐year floodplain maps, geographic information systems (GIS) data, and other natural disaster‐ related links such as hurricane preparation. Status: In Progress Action Update: The City’s website has been improved with regard to the availability of information, including links to the documents produced during the MVP process that are available for public viewing. Information contained in this new NHMP report will be placed on the website along with other documents described above. A dedicated webpage will be created for the information related to this report and will be made public through the Mayor’s Blog or other online media channels.  Incident Command Course (ICS): Initiate this course through the Emergency Management Department to better prepare City personnel for emergency response. Status: In Progress Action Update: The FEMA Emergency Management Institute now has updated incident command and National Incident Management Systems (NIMS) training courses, which can be found at: https://training.fema.gov/nims/. The City will determine the most appropriate training opportunities for personnel to ensure training needs are being met. The City will ensure that the Emergency Management Director has adequate training and that other City personnel involved in emergency response are also trained as needed.  Portable Generators: Purchase three portable generators for use in the following locations: one for City Hall, one for the City Yard on Tremont Street, and one to be shared among the five water and wastewater pump stations in the City. Status: Partial Completion Action Update: The City now owns three portable generators, as described above. However, as detailed elsewhere in this report, the generators are not sufficient to provide the needed backup power in emergency situations. The highest priority is to install a permanent generator at City Hall. The water and sewer pumping stations also require at least one more portable generator, along with modifications to ensure the ability to run all stations using the same portable equipment.  Secure Important Records: Scan important records and documents stored in City Hall onto microfilm (or electronic form). Store the copy of the records at a secure off‐site location away from the original records located at City Hall. Status: In Progress 5‐13Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions Action Update: Since 2004, the City has had some sets of documents scanned, such as the sewer and drainage plan sets. There are many more plans and documents that should be scanned with backups kept in an offsite storage location. The City intends to continue with this program until all critical records have been scanned. As new records are developed, electronic copies are created as a matter of routine protocol.  Reverse 911: Employ the use of a reverse 911 system in the City of Melrose to better assist the elderly and hazard victims. Status: Partial Completion Action Update: The City uses Reverse 911 for emergency situations and also has implemented the Code Red service for other notifications to residents. The City is presently in the process of reevaluating the choice of systems and will be entering into a contract with a vendor in the near future to serve the needs for community outreach for both emergency and non‐emergency situations. The Melrose Public Schools also use Direct Connect for contact with parents and guardians.  Enroll in the Community Rating System: Fill out the FEMA Community Rating System application so citizens in the City of Melrose who own houses in the 100‐year floodplain can qualify for discounts on flood insurance rate premiums. Status: No Action Action Update: City personnel are not aware of any action on this item, but it will be evaluated moving forward.  South Washington Street Trash Grate: Advise the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation to perform regular cleaning of the trash grate structure located at South Washington Street that often becomes blocked with debris. Status: In Progress Action Update: The City is continually coordinating with the DCR to ensure that this structure is routinely cleaned. The last known cleaning was in October 2018. The City will continue to coordinate with the DCR to ensure this work is done, as it has the potential to have significant impacts on upstream properties if flows are restricted due to the build‐up of debris. In addition to these actions, a short list of secondary actions were identified in the 2004 NHMP, as well as a handful of mitigation measures that were already being performed and are still relevant today. These actions have been carried forward into the later sections of this report for continued implantation or future action. They are as follows:  Maintain Melrose Emergency Management Department: The City has hired a new part‐ time Emergency Management Director in February 2019. This position should be maintained and continue to be funded. 5‐14Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions  Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan: The CEMP is a detailed report documenting policies, procedures, responsibilities, and training for various departments within the City. There is also a section detailing specific hazards (e.g., flood, hurricane, fire, etc.) and protocols to deal with these hazards. This plan requires updating to meet current needs and training to ensure proper implementation in the event of an emergency.  Policies for New Construction: The City has policies for new construction within the City ordinances that should be evaluated for opportunities to improve requirements, such as more emphasis on green infrastructure and other natural solutions that provide stormwater handling capacity and treatment and minimize impacts during storm events.  Emergency Shelter Areas: As detailed elsewhere in this report, the City has a plan for emergency shelters that requires updating, and shelters need to be evaluated to ensure they have the required infrastructure to support their use during a variety of emergency conditions.  Winter Storm Snow and Ice Warning Program for Flat Roof Buildings: The purpose of this program was to notify the owners of large flat roof properties of the potential for dangerous snow loads. It was suggested in 2004 to add to this list housing for mentally handicapped individuals and additional flat roof buildings which were not previously notified. This program has now been replaced with warnings placed on the Mayor’s Blog during heavy snow load conditions. This practice is planned to continue, with select outreach from the Inspectional Services Department to particular properties of concern when deemed beneficial.  Blue Warning Lights: In the 2004 NHMP, it was recommended that the City install warning lights at six to eight major intersections to alert citizens of an impending storm, the need for evacuation, or a parking ban. The effectiveness and applicability of these warning systems will be determined when considering whether to implement this type of system.  Wetlands Bylaw: The 2004 NHMP recommended considering whether to expand the City’s zero net runoff policy to all developments, rather than just small developments. This will continue to be considered, along with the policies for new construction noted above.  Fire Sprinkler System in City Hall: The 2004 NHMP recommended installing a sprinkler system throughout City Hall to protect this historic landmark. This has not been implemented and will continue to be considered when upgrades are undertaken for the building. 5‐15Section 6 Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategies 6.1 Goals for Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategies The goal of each of the hazard mitigation actions outlined in this section is intended to either mitigate the susceptibility of Melrose to a natural hazard or to better prepare the City to protect and manage the community in the occurrence of a natural hazard. This supports the overall goal of the NHMP to identify both known and potential risks from current and future natural hazards and to develop, through the community planning process, actions to reduce the risk from these hazards. Implementing these actions can reduce the risk of loss of life and property in Melrose. 6.2 Mitigation Strategies to Reduce Natural Hazard Risks Mitigation strategies and actions have been developed to address the asset vulnerabilities identified in Section 4.2 and in Section 5. The strategies presented within this section were identified based on overall best practices and through input from the MVP workshops held in April 2018, the MVP/NHMP public meeting held on June 21, 2018, the regional input meeting held on September 25, 2018, and further input from City staff. The City has already taken action on strategies identified, including hiring an Emergency Management Director in February 2019. As with the vulnerabilities identified in Section 4, the hazard mitigation strategies are separated into societal, infrastructure, and environmental categories to address the specific vulnerable assets identified within each. The mitigation strategies presented in this section are described in further detail in Appendix B. The table in Appendix B includes the hazard and vulnerability it is intended to mitigate. The table also identifies the strategy planning and implementation details: the project stage, priority, timeframe for implementation, and responsible party for each mitigation strategy; these are defined in Table 6‐1, below. Table 6‐1. Summary of Mitigation Strategy Planning and Implementation Details Category Definition Project The project stage identifies the type of mitigation strategy (e.g., training, public outreach) and/or Stage when in a project phase the mitigation strategy should be implemented (e.g., planning, design, etc.). Priority The priorities are high, medium, and low, based on feedback from the planning process described in Section 2. Timeframe Timeframe indicates how long a strategy may take to implement:  Ongoing timeframe: Part or all of the strategy is underway.  Short: The strategy may be completed within a five year timeframe.  Long: The strategy may take longer than five years to complete. Responsible The responsible party indicates which entity is responsible for the implementation of the strategy. It Party identifies specific organizations or City partnerships. Where the City is listed as the responsible party, the Public Works Department together with the Emergency Management Director will be responsible for working with relevant City departments on the implementation – including identifying and obtaining project funding sources, as appropriate. 6‐1Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions 6.2.1 Societal Hazard Mitigation Strategies to Improve Resilience The primary actions that can be taken to improve resiliency against flood, severe weather, and other natural hazard events for societal assets in Melrose are summarized below. Refer to Sections 4.2.1, 4.3, or Appendix B for the vulnerabilities that are addressed through these actions. The table in Appendix B also provides additional details that pertain to each mitigation action that should be referred to during their implementation.  Emergency Management Planning: Update emergency and evacuation plans to consider the increased frequency and intensity of climate change related natural disasters and to make these plans consistent with current and/or improved practices and protocols. This includes community outreach to educate citizens about the City's emergency notification system, to increase the number of people signed up. An up‐to date emergency and evacuation plan would reduce the potential risk posed to public health and safety by establishing standard preparedness and mitigation strategies that address modern day hazards. Additionally, promote the development of individual emergency and evacuation plans for every household and business in the area to ensure families and employers have an established plan of action in the event of an emergency. Continue to update, track progress, and participate in emergency management planning programs on a regular basis to ensure any appropriate changes are made when necessary.  Senior/Aging Population: Implement an education and outreach program for the senior/aging population to increase awareness about emergency response and evacuation plans and greatly improve the resiliency of this vulnerable population through appropriate preparedness. National Grid maintains a utility life support contact list that is used to communicate emergency event information to senior/aging populations. Leverage, update, and or expand this utility life support list to better plan for adequate availability of power and/or emergency relief resources to senior/aging populations, and help to expedite power reconnection for those that need it most. Development of any education and outreach campaign should specifically and clearly address how individuals can be added to National Grid’s utility life support contact list. Install a back‐up power generator at the senior center to ensure power and air conditioning is supplied to the senior/aging population in the event of a natural disaster.  Chronically Ill/Disabled Population: Chronically ill and disabled populations of Melrose face similar vulnerabilities and risks as the senior/aging population, therefore, similar actions are recommended. Additional actions include an education and outreach program at local hospitals, or for the caregivers of chronically ill or disabled individuals, to learn more about appropriate emergency response and evacuation plans. Outreach should promote the addition of any chronically ill or disabled individual, especially those that rely on medical equipment that requires power supply, to the National Grid utility life support contact list. Install back‐up generators at City shelters to provide reliable power and air conditioning at a place of refuge for chronically ill or disabled populations in Melrose, and ensure that designated shelters have appropriate accommodations for this population.  Non‐English Speaking Population: Evaluate the demographic information for the City of Melrose to determine the most prevalent non‐English language(s) among Melrose 6‐2Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions residents. Information gathered through such efforts could be used to develop effective multi‐lingual signage and education campaigns that provide clear and effective information about evacuation routes and emergency preparedness and response. Multi‐lingual signage along roads and emergency shelter locations, as well as educational advertisements or announcements in local newspapers, tv stations, radio stations, or at faith‐based organizations, can help inform the non‐English speaking population and ultimately reduce the overall risks associated with the inability to appropriately communicate or understand relevant emergency response or health and safety protocols during an emergency.  Low‐Income Population: The City of Melrose and the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development can work together to explore the possibility of developing a cooling assistance program to help low‐income populations pay for air conditioning during extreme heat events. The City will identify public spaces with air conditioning that residents may go to during heat events to cool down and consider providing transportation to these locations. Additionally, potential methods, partnerships, and programs that would help low‐income populations cover replacement costs for essential resources such as food, clothing, transportation, and temporary housing should be investigated. An education and outreach campaign targeting low‐income populations about emergency response and evacuation plans, as well as resources available to them to prepare for and recover from incurred damages, would also be an important and effective means of improving the resiliency of low‐income populations during and after a natural hazard event. The City will identify public spaces with air conditions  Faith Based Organizations: Install back‐up generators at faith‐based organizations to maintain power supply during an outage and allow for the use of such facilities as a safe refuge for those in need during a natural disaster. Efforts that educate faith‐based organization leaders about emergency response and evacuation plans, as well as on available resources that would provide food and water during an emergency, can help improve the City’s resiliency by increasing methods of communication. Coordination with faith‐based organizations may also provide additional shelter space and/or supplies to area residents during a natural hazard event.  Pet Owners: The City should develop a list of possible locations for pets to go during an emergency event that pet owners can easily access. Additionally, the City and local animal shelters can work together to identify designated pet‐friendly emergency shelter locations that would accommodate household pets in the event of a natural disaster. The Animal Control Officer will be included in appropriate hazard mitigation training and planning activities. 6.2.2 Infrastructure Hazard Mitigation Strategies to Improve Resilience The actions that can be taken to improve resiliency against natural hazard events for infrastructure assets in Melrose are summarized below. Refer to Section 4.2.2, 4.3, or Appendix B for the specific hazards and vulnerabilities that are addressed through these actions, along with additional details for implementation. 6‐3Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions  Transportation Infrastructure: Ensure that existing evacuation routes allow for fast movement and avoid locations prone to flooding, and that evacuation signage is clearly visible and easily understood by English and non‐English speaking populations. Educate City emergency and DPW personnel on route locations and required maintenance, such as the regular removal of debris from storm drains located along evacuation routes. Design and construction efforts that improve the management of stormwater along important roadways can have significant beneficial impacts that would reduce the risk of road closures or damaged infrastructure as a result of flooding or severe weather events. Design and construction efforts include the implementation or expansion of green infrastructure in flood prone areas, as well as upgrades to drainage systems to manage a higher capacity of stormwater. The roadway areas noted in Section 5 require particular attention. An upgrade to the emergency communication and notification system would also ensure that travelers on transportation networks are aware of evacuation routes, delays, and availability of alternative travel routes in real‐time. The City may be able to work with MassDOT, DCR and/or Verizon to identify and develop a standard protocol that would help to notify Melrose residents of evacuation procedures before or during a natural hazard event.  City Hall: Installation of a back‐up generator to provide power during an outage is of high priority to maintaining the City’s communications systems and Emergency Management Command Center. The City should also elevate critical mechanical and electrical equipment above ground level where possible and incorporate dry and/or wet floodproofing techniques that would minimize potential flood damage. Incorporate green infrastructure practices such as bioretention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens, and/or pervious pavement to reduce potential flood impacts within the City Hall parking lot, and regrade the parking lot to accommodate such features. The City also needs to continue to secure critical records, by scanning and storing records in multiple locations including offsite electronic storage.  Fire and Police Stations: Install back‐up power generators at the fire and police stations to maintain power and critical emergency functions at these facilities during a power outage. Protect emergency response equipment and materials within these facilities against flood by relocating equipment, back‐up power generators, and emergency response vehicles outside current and future flood prone areas. If relocation is not possible, materials and equipment can be elevated to the greatest extent practicable to reduce the potential risk of flood damage.  Residential and Commercial Properties: Residential and commercial properties in flood prone areas would particularly benefit from the implementation of green infrastructure practices such as bioswales, rain gardens, rainwater harvesting, bioretention ponds, and pervious pavement. Develop and implement stricter ordinances for new and existing developments to help Melrose protect its residential and commercial buildings from flood damage. Train and/or certify contractors and developers on appropriate resilience measures and changes to ordinances to ensure all new developments are built with resilience to natural hazards in mind. Also continue to ensure that existing building codes are being strictly followed. 6‐4Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions  Memorial Hall: Memorial Hall is designated as an emergency shelter but lacks emergency backup power and other infrastructure necessary to ensure appropriate lighting and temperatures can be maintained and that appropriate storage is available for food and other supplies. A backup generator should be installed at Memorial Hall if it will continue to be designated as a shelter location. Further measures should be taken to prevent emergency response equipment and supplies from damage by locating them at elevations outside of flooding areas and implementing floodproofing measures where applicable.  Emergency Shelters: Install a back‐up power generator at emergency shelters throughout the City to reliably supply power and heating, ventilation, and air‐conditioning (HVAC) at locations that provide refuge to those in need. Develop an emergency shelter management plan that includes specific guidelines about adequate multi‐lingual signage, as well as information about food supply and storage locations, resources for medications or medical emergencies, and information about water supply. Similar to other emergency response and communication facilities, important equipment and supplies should be protected from potential flood damage through relocation to non‐flood prone areas or materials and equipment should be stored on elevated surfaces above ground level. Elevate existing transportation assets, utilize stormwater best management practices, and regularly clear debris or downed trees along roadways and sidewalks in areas near shelters to ensure easy access during emergencies.  Schools/Child Care Facilities: Upgrade HVAC systems and implement green roofs or tree planting efforts. Implement green infrastructure such as bioretention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens, and/or pervious pavement at Melrose High School and Middle School, and incorporate dry and wet floodproofing techniques in buildings that fall within future flood prone areas. Enforce building codes on fire prevention and elevator maintenance, as well as regular drills and training for students and teachers. Improve school and child care facility preparedness for an emergency and help minimize potential impacts associated with natural hazard events. Installation of a generator at City Hall will also allow for uninterrupted communications at the school facilities which use the City Hall infrastructure for connectivity.  Melrose‐Wakefield Hospital: Coordinate and cross‐train emergency management personnel from the City and the hospital so both are aware of emergency plans and protocols, including a plan to continuously and effectively communicate the Hospital’s capacity and hazard exposure with emergency personnel and the media during an emergency event. Elevate existing transportation assets, use stormwater best management practices, and regularly clear debris or downed vegetation along roadways leading to the hospital. Dry and wet floodproofing techniques may also be implemented throughout the hospital to help improve resiliency against flood impacts. Investigate if the hospital could act as a 24‐hour pharmacy to the public before, during, and/or after an emergency situation to serve as a location where the public may acquire needed medications when pharmacies may be closed or have inadequate supply.  Pharmacies: Store in‐demand or difficult to acquire medications outside future flood prone areas, or off the floor above possible flooding areas, to protect such valuable supplies 6‐5Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions from being inundated and lost during a severe flood. Extend hours of operation prior to an emergency to ensure the public has adequate opportunity to acquire needed medications as appropriate. Elevate existing transportation assets, use stormwater best management practices, and regularly clear debris or downed vegetation along roadways leading to the pharmacies.  Gas Infrastructure: Regularly maintain and restore damaged gas line infrastructure, as well as the monitor waterways where buried gas lines are nearby for scour or erosion. Use appropriate resilient design and materials when upgrading or expanding gas pipelines. Regularly train and/or certify gas infrastructure contractors and National Grid personnel on resiliency protocols. Continue to aggressively work with the National Grid to have leak prone pipe materials replaced with more resilient materials.  Electrical/Power Infrastructure: Implement microgrids where feasible to minimize the occurrence of wide scale power outages and expedite power reconnections. Maintain a buffer or clear zone between the edge of power lines and adjacent tree belts or woodland areas to minimize the potential for outages incurred as a result of falling trees or limbs. Elevate critical electrical equipment in future flood prone areas to protect against potential flood damages. Regularly maintain and repair damaged electrical systems and power infrastructure. Construct alternative energy systems and use renewable energy as the primary energy source where possible. Upgrade electric utility lines and/or install buried lines when feasible. Develop of a list of available “on call” electricians that can connect National Grid power lines from poles to the homes of at risk populations. Identify and repair locations where buried electrical infrastructure is prone to flooding and associated failure. Develop an ongoing training program to properly educate the City’s labor force on appropriate emergency response actions and ensure National Grid has done the same. Develop procedures and plans for when peak power demand exceeds capacity during an extreme heat event and/or the develop and implement design standards for electrical equipment that can withstand higher maximum temperatures.  Fuel Sources: Designate secure fuel storage locations for fuel reserves used during a natural disaster away from flood prone areas. Partner with gas stations across the City to extend hours of operation prior to an emergency event to ensure the public has access to adequate fuel supplies for long‐term hazard events.  Food Sources: Designate secure food storage locations away from flood prone areas to house food reserves that would be used in the event of a natural disaster. Partner with grocery stores to extend hours of operation prior to an emergency event to ensure the public has access to adequate supplies of food and water for long‐term hazard events. Grocery stores and food pantries should also be involved in the development of emergency shelter management plans to ensure adequate food and water supplies are available to emergency shelters during a natural hazard event. In addition, food source and safety information will be provided in multiple languages.  Communications Infrastructure: Close the City’s fiberoptic loop to form a redundant pathway for information to get back through the network if there is a breach in the loop. A voice over internet protocol (VOIP) system could also be utilized to allow telephone 6‐6Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions networks to quickly be routed to another location which would allow City officials’ phone numbers to travel with their cell phones. This would facilitate uninterrupted communication with City officials during the planning and coordination phase of emergency response and during and post disaster. Bury communication lines where possible. Maintain and restore damaged communication infrastructure. Upgrade emergency communication and real‐time notification systems used by travelers on transportation networks. Elevate critical communication equipment, or relocate equipment away from future flood prone areas. Ensure access to portable cell towers and generator systems that can provide temporary communication and electrical services to areas that need it during an emergency event. Ensure information technology (IT) equipment has redundancy, uninterrupted power supply, and other precautions for unforeseen events where deemed beneficial. Develop ongoing training programs that properly educate the labor force on appropriate emergency response actions.  Sewer Pumping Stations: Install back‐up power (either onsite or portable) and bypass capability at the five sewer pumping stations. Elevate pumping station equipment located within flood prone areas, where possible. Regularly maintain and repair damaged infrastructure, and continue infiltration and inflow reduction measures in sewers to prevent backups and overflows during high flow events.  Water Pumping Stations: Elevate water pumping station equipment located within flood prone areas, where possible. Regularly maintain and repair damaged infrastructure. Routinely maintain backup equipment to ensure its availability during emergency events.  Water and Sewer Pipelines: Identify areas of concern and prioritize repair and replacement efforts through water and wastewater infrastructure condition assessments. Regularly maintain and repair damaged infrastructure, and develop ongoing training programs to properly educate the labor force on appropriate emergency response actions. Training should include updating water system emergency response plans and understanding MWRA emergency protocols. Coordinate with neighboring towns and cities with regard to mutual aid water connections and potential sewer surcharge conditions when sending wastewater downstream. Maintain the map of mutual aid connections in the Water System Emergency Response Plan.  Stormwater Drainage Infrastructure: Conduct stormwater drainage studies to address flooding that results from insufficient capacity or other deficiencies in the drainage system, including the areas listed in Section 5. Results can be used to strategically repair deficiencies, increase capacity, or construct green infrastructure in areas that would benefit the most. Dredge stormwater outfalls in areas prone to flooding, as well as develop and implement a stormwater maintenance plan. Keep stormwater infrastructure mapping up‐ to‐date. Coordinate with neighboring towns, cities, and state agencies when sending drainage downstream and monitor associated infrastructure issues. 6.2.3 Environmental Hazard Mitigation Strategies to Improve Resilience The actions that can be taken to improve resiliency against flood, severe weather, and other natural hazard events for environmental assets in Melrose are summarized below. Refer to 6‐7Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions Section 4.2.3, 4.3, or Appendix B for the vulnerabilities that are addressed through these actions and additional details for implementation.  Water Bodies: Lakes/Rivers/Reservoirs: Investigate opportunities to install flood control gates that would better manage flows during a significant flood event. Increase channel capacity within streams and rivers by removing large obstacles within channels or through the dredging of water features in flood prone areas. Plant trees and vegetation to expand vegetative buffers and stabilize river and stream embankments to reduce erosion and scour during high flow events while also mitigating the impacts that high temperatures can have on aquatic habitats. Encourage green infrastructure through City policies, ordinances, and design standards to better manage stormwater runoff and potentially reduce impacts associated with flood events.  Parks/Natural Areas/Open Space: Investigate and implement mosquito management measures, including ditch maintenance, to reduce the spread of disease from current and new mosquito populations, as appropriate. Protect and expand wetland areas, natural systems, and vegetative buffers where possible to improve flood management and conserve natural areas. Conduct routine maintenance of parks and natural areas to remove or relocate dead vegetation to reduce the risk of wildfire during drought or extreme heat conditions.  Tree Canopy: Create a funded tree warden or certified arborist position, or train existing personnel to obtain certification, to advise on resilient tree species and provide tree canopy assessments. Consider public‐private partnerships for funding tree planting and maintenance. Conduct routine monitoring of street trees and trees in parks and natural areas, to reduce the potential for wildfire, downed trees or limbs damaging communication, electrical, transportation, or other infrastructure assets. Efforts should focus on preserving and enhancing the tree canopy to reduce urban heat island effects and reduce emissions from cooling loads. Offer incentive programs or outreach targeting property owners to plant trees with higher survivability and resiliency against extreme conditions.  Wildlife: Investigate mosquito management measures that would help reduce the spread of disease within the wildlife or human populations of Melrose. Protect, expand, or restore wetland areas, natural systems, and vegetative buffers and perform routine monitoring of those areas for potential threats to vegetation, including the identification and potential removal of invasive species. Promote green infrastructure that provides habitat value in addition to stormwater volume and quality mitigation where possible.  Air Quality: Develop an air quality monitoring and alert system to notify the population of Melrose of poor air quality events and provide recommendations for safe levels of outdoor activity to reduce the risk of health impacts associated with air pollution, and provide a link on the City's website. Plant trees in urban areas. Continue to implement Complete Streets principles as well as the enforcement of anti‐idling laws for vehicles. Create campaigns that encourage behaviors that decrease energy use and reduce emissions. 6‐8Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions 6.3 High Priority Hazard Mitigation Strategies The high priority hazard mitigation actions are summarized in Table 6‐2. These were identified through the planning process outlined in Section 2 and reflect the priorities of the community. It is the City’s intent to implement these prioritized actions to reduce risk and build resiliency within the community. The responsible parties identified for implementing these strategies are also responsible for obtaining funding to implement them. Funding may be from the City’s annual budget or grants, including MVP action grants or FEMA funds for which the City will be eligible with the completion of this NHMP. Other sources of funding will be identified as the City becomes aware of them. The timeframe for implementing these strategies is indicated in the table as ongoing (O), short term – within five years (S), or long term – more than five years (L). Refer to Appendix B of this report for more details and additional information about project stage, time frame, and responsible party. Table 6‐2.

Wildlife X X X X XSection 7 Implementation of the Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan 7.1 Implementation Process and Monitoring The goal of this NHMP is to identify both known and potential risks from current and future natural hazards and to develop, through the community planning process, actions to reduce the risk from these hazards. This NHMP represents the culmination of a significant planning effort that involved stakeholders from across City government, the community, and regional partners. This NHMP is the primary resilience planning document in the City of Melrose, the findings of which will be incorporated into planning documents and processes including the City’s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan. The mitigation strategies to address hazards summarized in Section 6 identify the responsible party for implementation along with the priority set by the community planning process. The implementation of high priority hazard mitigation strategies will be monitored by the responsible parties shown in Section 7.3 unless otherwise noted in Appendix B. In general, implementation of the recommendations in this NHMP will be tracked by the Public Works Department together with the Emergency Management Director on an ongoing basis for the effectiveness of achieving the NHMP goals. The NHMP will be available to the public on the City’s website along with the primary contact information for the Department of Public Works (DPW), the City Engineer, and the Emergency Management Director, all of whom will be available to receive and respond to public input on this NHMP. The DPW Director, City Engineer, and/or Emergency Management Director will present on the NHMP’s progress to the Board of Aldermen on an annual basis. Meetings with the Board of Aldermen are open to the public and broadcast on the City’s local television station, MMTV. The Public Works Department will also bring outreach materials on preparedness and resilience that are developed as a result of this NHMP to the booth they host at the City’s annual Victorian Fair every September – a popular, well‐attended public event. An Emergency Management team made up of the Police Department, Fire Department, Public Works Department, Emergency Management Department, Information Technology Department, and Mayor’s Office meets on a regular basis. The Director of Public Works and the Emergency Management Director will use this forum as a platform to present hazards and vulnerabilities identified in this NHMP and update this group on the status of the prioritized mitigation strategies. They will also solicit additional feedback on this NHMP as needed from the Emergency Management team. In addition, this NHMP will be evaluated regularly and reevaluated following any natural disaster to ensure it remains up to date and useful by the DPW Director and the Emergency Management Director. The Public Work Department will also oversee the formal adoption of the NHMP by the City – documentation of which is available in Appendix C. 7‐1Section 7  Implementation of the Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan 7.2 Schedule for Updating the Plan The City has committed to updating the NHMP every five years as required by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. The Public Works Department will spearhead the next Melrose NHMP Update beginning no later than mid‐2023. The update of the NHMP will meet the requirements in place at the time of its publication, including any public meetings, updates on the implementation of prioritized mitigation strategies, and an evaluation of further refined climate data, as available. Public meeting information will be widely publicized at least one week prior to each meeting. 7.3 Responsible Parties and Contacts Multiple agencies within the City government, community members, and regional partners provided input into this NHMP.

Melrose, Massachusetts.Summary of Findings 1.1 Overview The City of Melrose was awarded a $19,000 grant from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to conduct Community Resilience Building (CRB) workshops in the City. This funding is through a new program called Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP). Conducting the workshops allows Melrose to achieve “MVP” designation from the Commonwealth – a designation that gives the City access to further funding to implement resilient actions. Melrose is also in the process of updating the Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan (HMP) and will incorporate the findings from the CRB workshops; the HMP will be the primary resilience planning document for the City of Melrose. The City engaged the consulting firm, CDM Smith, to assist with both efforts. 1.2 Community Resilience Building Workshops In Melrose, the workshops held in conjunction with the MVP program were a new initiative to immediately integrate community‐derived priorities into a natural hazard mitigation process and identify actions to build resilience in the community. The workshops’ central objectives were to:  Define top local natural and climate‐related hazards of concern;  Identify existing and future strengths and vulnerabilities;  Develop prioritized actions for the community;  Identify immediate opportunities to collaboratively advance actions to increase resilience. A core team was established for this process, which consisted of:  Martha Grover, Energy Efficiency Manager  Elena Proakis Ellis, City Engineer  John Scenna, Director of Public Works Prior to the workshops, the core team identified preliminary hazards and areas of concerns. These were mapped and presented at the workshops and included in a participatory mapping exercise (see Appendix A). The core team, along with the consultant, identified departments and organizations recommended to attend the workshops. These were: Chamber of Commerce, Comcast, Conservation Commission, Department of Public Works, EMARC, Emergency Management Department, Fire Department, First Congregational Church, First Methodist Church, Friends of the Fells, Hallmark Health Emergency Preparedness, Health Department, Human Rights Commission, Information Technology, Mayor's Office, Melrose Energy Commission, Melrose Historical Commission, Melrose Housing Authority, Melrose Public Schools, Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, Mystic Valley Elder Services, National Grid, Office of Planning and Community Development, Parks Department, Pedestrian and Bicycle 1‐1Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building Advisory Committee, Police Department, Riverside Community Care, State Representatives/ Senators, and Verizon. All were invited by the Mayor to participate; see section 1.3.3 for a specific list of workshop participants. The workshops were held on two days: Thursday, April 5, and Wednesday, April 11, 2018. Prior to attending the workshops, the participants were asked to fill out a survey, a copy of which can be found in Appendix B, along with the survey results. 1.2.1 Top Hazards and Vulnerable Areas At the first workshop, participants were asked to identify connections between ongoing community issues, hazards, and local planning and actions in Melrose. They were also asked to identify and map vulnerabilities and strengths to develop infrastructure, societal, and environmental risk profiles for Melrose. Maps reflecting City landmarks and facilities, existing and potential areas of flooding concern, and possible heat impacts were prepared for discussion (see Appendix A). To facilitate this exercise, the following definitions from the World Bank1 were discussed with participants:  Hazard: A physical process or event (hydro‐meteorological or oceanographic variables or phenomena) that can harm human health, livelihoods, or natural resources.  Risk: The potential for consequences where something is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain.  Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental services and resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places that could be adversely affected by a hazard.  Sensitivity: The degree to which a system, asset, or species may be affected, either adversely or beneficially, when exposed to climate variability or change or geophysical hazards.  Vulnerability or Strength: The potential effects of hazards on human or natural assets and systems. These potential effects, which are determined by both exposure and sensitivity, may be beneficial or harmful. As a brainstorming exercise, participants were asked the following triggering questions from the CRB Workshop Guide:  What hazards have impacted Melrose in the past? Where, how often, and in what ways?  What hazards are impacting your community currently?  What effects will these hazards/changes have on Melrose in the future (3, 5, 10, 25 years)?  What/who is exposed to hazards and climate threats within your community?  Other concerns or considerations? 1 Source: World Bank: https://climatescreeningtools.worldbank.org/content/key‐terms‐0 1‐2Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building The hazards, risks, and vulnerabilities from this brainstorming session are presented in Figure 1‐ 1. Figure 1‐1 Melrose Hazards, Risks, and Vulnerabilities (brainstorm results) CDMth Sm1 1‐3Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building 1.2.1.1 Top Hazards The Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs (EEA) summarized the existing and expected future climate conditions by major watershed in the Commonwealth. Melrose falls into two watersheds; however, the majority of the City is in the Boston Harbor Basin. Therefore, projections from this basin were used as a basis for discussing future climate change in the City (see Appendix C). The key takeaways2 from EEA on the future climate conditions are:  Regardless of geographic scale, rising temperatures, changing precipitation, and extreme weather will continue to affect the people and resources of the Commonwealth.  Average, maximum, and minimum temperatures are expected to increase; seasonally, maximum summer and fall temperatures are expected to see the highest projected increase and minimum winter and fall temperatures are expected to increase.  The number of days receiving precipitation over one inch are variable, fluctuating between loss and gain of days.  Seasonal projections for total precipitation are also variable for the Boston Harbor basin. The winter season is expected to experience the greatest change with an increase of 0‐20% by mid‐century, and 3‐34% by end of century.  Annual and seasonal projections for consecutive dry days, or for a given period, are variable.  Precipitation will be more variable. “Extreme” precipitation events are likely to occur more often. With these climate change impacts in mind, the group was divided into three working groups, each of which was asked to identify the top four hazards from this list or others they felt were important to address. The Top Hazards were:  Extreme temperature3 (3 groups)  Flooding (2 groups)  Major Storms (2 groups)  Wind (2 groups)  Power Loss (2 groups)  Disease (1 group) 2 These impacts are direct from the document provided by EEA to MVP communities in December 2017 entitled “Massachusetts Climate Change Projections.” 3 One group identified extreme heat; two groups identified extreme temperatures which includes heat and cold. 1‐4Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building 1.2.1.2 Areas of Concern Identified by Core Team Prior to the meeting, the core team identified areas of concern due to potential hazards. They included sanitary sewer overflows, the ability to respond to large snowstorms, and the need for back‐up power at sewer pump stations, cooling stations, and especially at City Hall. Additional areas with flooding concerns were noted to include:  Geneva Road drainage that ties into Upham Street  Outfalls at Wyoming Cemetery, downstream to Malden, and structure at Swain’s Pond  Connection between Towners Pond and Swain’s Pond  Lebanon Street at Sylvan Street  City Hall parking lot  Railway bridge at Melrose Street  Conant Park at Ravine Terrace  Derby Road 1.2.2 Current Concerns and Challenges Presented by Hazards Melrose has faced natural hazards in the past like other Massachusetts communities, including flooding from the Mother’s Day storm in 2006, overwhelming snowfall totals during the winter of 2015, and most recently the nor’easter events in January and March 2018. During the March 2018 storm, City Hall lost power, which disabled the phone lines to emergency responders. In addition to the areas of concern raised by the core team, participants identified other concerns and challenges during the brainstorming session at the first workshop. These included:  Maintaining and improving quality of life in Melrose  Managing insects, pests, and wildlife with changes in precipitation patterns and increasing temperatures  Ability to stay in good financial standing and obtain insurance despite climate stressors  Cyber security concerns, maintaining communication pathways, and information technology systems (IT) during events  Vulnerability of transportation systems to all hazards – including: 1) pothole maintenance from multiple freeze‐thaw periods and 2) public transportation reliability  Damage to property during events 1‐5Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building  Population increases and the demands on public systems and housing availability  Fallen trees during storms and the ability to remove them in a timely manner  Poor air quality as temperatures rise, especially during heat waves  Increasing energy use and strain on the electrical grid during heat waves  Maintaining water quality through changing conditions  Ability of aging infrastructure to withstand current and future hazards 1.2.3 Specific Categories of Concerns and Challenges The working groups further discussed specific concerns and challenges in each of the categories of infrastructure, society, and environment. These findings, characterized as vulnerabilities, are presented in Appendix D in the Risk Matrix and in Table 1‐1 below. Of particular concern, as highlighted by every working group, was the lack of emergency generation capacity at City Hall. Melrose City Hall is the hub of communications in Melrose; calls to police, fire, ambulance, and schools are all routed through City Hall. During a power outage, like the one experienced during the March 2018 nor’easter, calls to these important services do not go through and calling out from land line phones is not feasible. This results in potential hazards of the highest magnitude through the lack of immediate communication during storm related events. 1.2.4 Current Strengths and Assets The working groups discussed strengths and community assets in each of the categories of infrastructure, society, and environment during the latter half of the first workshop. These findings are presented in Appendix D in the Risk Matrix and in Table 1‐1 below. Several strengths of note were discussed, including:  Melrose has improved and upgraded stormwater systems to manage and mitigate existing flooding issues. These include drainage improvements to Ell Pond and have had a dramatically positive impact on the community.  There are many faith‐based organizations and associated places of worship in Melrose. These are a strength due to the community resilience they provide, the potential to use these organizations as a conduit for information to the public, and as a physical location of refuge and aid during or after an event.  Melrose has an excellent team of first responders and emergency action plans. This coupled with a local hospital are community strengths; however, the emergency planning documents require updating, which is a vulnerability.  Melrose has a Shelter Management Plan and identified shelters to provide for citizens during a time of need, which is a strength, although services at these locations require review (e.g., air conditioning, backup power, food availability and storage, etc.) 1‐6Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building Table 1‐1 Vulnerabilities and Strengths in Melrose Infrastructure Vulnerabilities and Strengths V or S?

Each working group developed actions that would reduce vulnerability and enhance strengths for the features identified during the first workshop. The actions target one or multiple of the hazards in each of the categories of infrastructure, society, and environment. These actions were prioritized by each group as a high, medium, or low priority and assigned a timeframe for action of either short, long, or ongoing. These findings are presented in Appendix D in the Risk Matrix. 1.2.5.1 Top Recommendations to Improve Resilience Each working group identified the top five priority actions to improve resilience based on vulnerabilities and strengths identified by their group. These were presented to all workshop participants, who then voted on their top priorities from the aggregated list. The top action across every team was the need to install an emergency generator at City Hall. This project naturally rose to the top of the immediate needs list for the City of Melrose. The top five priority actions presented by the working groups were:  Install a generator at critical public buildings and shelters4 (1 group), specifically City Hall (3 groups)  Install back‐up power and bypass capability at water and sewer pump stations, including elevating infrastructure as appropriate (2 groups)  Create a communications plan / conduct public outreach on hazards (2 groups)  Update the emergency management plan which includes an evacuation plan, communication, and drills (2 group) 4 One group generators at public buildings – including City Hall; two groups identified generators at City Hall specifically. 1‐8Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building  Dredge stormwater outfalls, obtain a universal permit, and create a maintenance plan, which includes mosquito management (2 groups)  Update the MS4 permit (1 group)  Implement green infrastructure and green buildings, including zoning, stormwater, green energy, best management practices for developers, specific projects (1 group)  Create a funded, dedicated emergency management director and a memorandum of understanding for emergency response (1 group)  Create a funded tree warden position to advise on resilient tree species and consider public‐private partnerships for funding for maintenance and planting (1 group) After each team presented on their top five actions, each person was allowed three votes to allocate to any of the actions as show in Figure 1‐2. This voting process determined the prioritized actions which are the Top Recommendations to Improve Resilience in Melrose. Furthermore, some sub‐categories were established within these top priorities, as shown below: 1. Install an emergency generator at City Hall (17 votes) 2. Advance stormwater management actions including (9 votes): a. Dredge stormwater outfalls, b. Create a stormwater permit and maintenance plan, and c. Better manage mosquitos to reduce the spread of disease. 3. Improve emergency management including (9 votes): a. Update the emergency management plan, including evacuation routes and procedures, b.

Increased stormwater leads to increased nuisance flooding, increased levels of pollutants entering the region's waterbodies, and higher demands on the combined sewer system. Stormwater also creates other challenges, including increased carbon emissions as water is pumped through sewer systems and then treated in treatment plants. This map highlights areas that may be at risk of decreased water quality and increased flooding due to increased rainfall events and was created by combining the following criteria: Current Flood Zones Estimated Runoff Potential Soil Permeability Slope Existing Wetlands Coastal Adaption Areas Sinks Water Quality Legend µ Figure 2: 1 Climate-Smart Cities Layers Metro Mayor's Police Station Affordable Housing Pavement !··-··1 Stormwater Challenges i.. ___ j Metro Mayors study area boundary r - 1 Fire Station Long Term Care Historic District Metro Area Planning Council (MAPC) town boundary City of Melrose, MA L _____ ; Priority lands already under protection City Hall Historic District Buildings Conservation Land Parks, open space, or other protected land ^^ Town Boundary Hospital Emergency Generators Addressing stormwater challenges priorities #* Railroad School Emergency Shelter • Veryhigh High Courts Library D Pump Stations 0 400 800 1,600 Moderate Feet \") P Water Pump Station \") P Wastewater Pump Station Source: City of Melrose, MassGIS, FEMA, TPL, and MAPC CDMlh 1) Climate-Smart Cities: Metro Mayor Climate-Smart Region, November 13, 2017 Coordinate System: NAD83 Mass.

We are excited to work with you to identify and prioritize actions to improve Melrose’s resilience to climate change. These actions will aim to reduce impacts from climate-related hazards to infrastructural, societal, and environmental components to our community – today, and in the future. This information will also be used in conjunction with the on-going Hazard Mitigation Plan update which gives the City the opportunity to apply for grant funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for projects that are necessary to mitigate risks to the community from natural disasters. We are asking participants to complete this brief survey, which focuses on how the community currently perceives, assesses, and acts to reduce risks. This will help us understand your concerns and priorities to make the most of our workshops. We look forward to your feedback! - Martha Grover, Energy Efficiency Manager, City of Melrose - Elena Proakis Ellis, City Engineer, City of Melrose - Lauren Miller, MVP Trained Facilitator / Consultant, CDM Smith 1.

The Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs has provided support for these projections to enable municipalities, industry, organizations, state government and others to utilize a standard, peer‐reviewed set of climate change projections that show how the climate is likely to change in Massachusetts through the end of this century. Temperature and Precipitation Projections The temperature and precipitation climate change projections are based on simulations from the latest generation of climate models1 from the International Panel on Climate Change and scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions.2 The models were carefully selected from a larger ensemble of climate models based on their ability to provide reliable climate information for the Northeast U.S., while maintaining diversity in future projections that capture some of the inherent uncertainty in modeling climate variables like precipitation. The medium (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) emission scenarios were chosen for possible pathways of future greenhouse gas emissions. A moderate scenario of future greenhouse gas emissions assumes a peak around mid‐century, which then declines rapidly over the second half of the century, while the highest scenario assumes the continuance of the current emissions trajectory. Fourteen climate models have been run with 2 emission scenarios each, which lead to 28 projections. The values cited in the tables below are based on the 10‐90th percentiles across the 28 projections, so they bracket the most likely scenarios. For simplicity, we use the terms “…expected to…,” and “…will be…,” but recognize that these are estimates based on model scenarios and are not predictive forecasts. The statewide projections comprising county‐ and basin‐level information are derived by statistically downscaling the climate model results.3 They represent the best estimates that we can currently provide for a range of anticipated changes in greenhouse gases. Note that precipitation projections are generally more uncertain than temperature. 1These latest generation of climate models are included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), which formed the basis of projections summarized in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2013). 2 Future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios are typically expressed as “Representative Concentration Pathways” (RCPs). They indicate emissions trajectories that would lead to certain levels of radiative forcing by 2100, relative to the pre‐industrial state of the atmosphere; RCP4.5 equates to +4.5W m‐2, and RCP 8.5 would be +8.5W m‐2. In effect, they represent different pathways that society may or may not follow, to reduce emissions through climate change mitigation measures. 3 The Local Constructed Analogs (LOCA) method (Pierce et al., 2014) was used for the statistical downscaling of the statewide projections.The downscaled temperature and precipitation projections for the Commonwealth are provided at three geographic scales (Table 1) for annual and seasonal temporal scales (Table 2), and can be accessed through the Massachusetts Climate Change Clearinghouse website (www.massclimatechange.org). The statewide projections are included in this guidebook, but temperature and precipitation projections at each of the Commonwealth’s major basins are accessible on the website and as a supplemental PDF to this guide. These climate projections are provided to help municipal officials, state agency staff, land managers, and others to identify future hazards related to, or exacerbated by changing climatic conditions. For the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) program participants, we recommend using climate projections downscaled to the major basin scale (Table 1) as there are regional differences across several climate indicators (Table 3). These projections can help MVP communities to think through how future hazards in their community may change, given projected changes in temperature and precipitation. Regardless of geographic scale, rising temperatures, changing precipitation, and extreme weather will continue to affect the people and resources of the Commonwealth throughout the 21st century. A first step in becoming more climate-resilient is to identify the climate changes your community will be exposed to, the impacts and risks to critical assets, functions, vulnerable populations arising from these changes, the underlying sensitivities to these types of changes, and the background stressors that may exacerbate overall vulnerability.

Maximum annual or seasonal temperature expressed in degrees Maximum temperature Fahrenheit (⁰F). Minimum annual or seasonal temperature expressed in degrees Minimum temperature Fahrenheit (⁰F). Days with Tmax > 90 ⁰F Number of days when daily maximum temperature exceeds 90⁰F. Days with Tmax > 95 ⁰F Number of days when daily maximum temperature exceeds 95⁰F. Days with Tmax > 100 ⁰F Number of days when daily maximum temperature exceeds 100⁰F. Days with Tmin < 32 ⁰F Number of days when daily minimum temperature is below 32 ⁰F. Days with Tmin < 0 ⁰F Number of days when daily minimum temperature is below 0 ⁰F. Heating degree-days (HDD) are a measure of how much and for how long outside air temperature was lower than a specific base temperature. HDD are the difference between the average daily Heating degree-days temperature and 65°F. For example, if the mean temperature is (base 65 ⁰F) 30°F, we subtract the mean from 65 and the result is 30 heating degree-days for that day. HDD serves as a proxy that captures Temperature energy consumption required to heat buildings, and is used in utility planning and building design.5 Cooling degree days (CDD) are a measure of how much and for how long outside air temperature was higher than a specific base temperature. CDD are the difference between the average daily Cooling degree-days temperature and 65°F. For example, if the temperature mean is (base 65 ⁰F) 90°F, we subtract 65 from the mean and the result is 25 cooling degree-days for that day. CDD serves as a proxy that captures energy consumption required to cool buildings, and is used in utility planning and building design. 6 Growing degree days (GDD) are a measure of heat accumulation that can be correlated to express crop maturity (plant development). GDD is computed by subtracting a base temperature of 50°F from the average of the maximum and Growing degree-days minimum temperatures for the day. Minimum temperatures less (base 50 ⁰F) than 50°F are set to 50, and maximum temperatures greater than 86°F are set to 86. These substitutions indicate that no appreciable growth is detected with temperatures lower than 50° or greater than 86°.7 5 For seasonal or annual projections, HDD are summed for the period of interest. For example, for winter HDD, one would sum the HDD for December 1 through February 28. Degree-days are not the equivalent of calendar days and thus why it is possible to have more than 365 degree-days. 6 For seasonal or annual projections, CDD are summed for the period of interest. For example, for summer CDD, one would sum the CDD for June 1 through August 31. Degree-days are not the equivalent of calendar days and thus why it is possible to have more than 365 degree-days. 7 Definition adapted from National Weather Service. Degree-days are not the equivalent of calendar days and thus why it is possible to have more than 365 degree-days.Table 4: List and definitions of projected precipitation indicators Climate Climate Indicator Definition Variable Total annual or seasonal precipitation expressed in Total precipitation inches.

For a given period, the largest number of Consecutive dry days consecutive days with precipitation less than 1 mm (0.039 inches). Impacts from Increasing Temperatures Warmer temperatures and extended heat waves could have very significant impacts on public health in our state, as well as the health of plants, animals and ecosystems like forests and wetlands. Rising temperatures will also affect important economic sectors like agriculture and tourism, and infrastructure like the electrical grid. Annual air temperatures in the Northeast have been warming at an average rate of 0.5°F (nearly 0.26°C) per decade since 1970. Winter temperatures have been rising at a faster rate of 0.9°F8 per decade on average. Even what seems like a very small rise in average temperatures can cause major changes in other factors, such as the relative proportion of precipitation that falls as rain or snow. In Massachusetts, temperatures are projected to increase significantly over the next century. Winter average temperatures are likely to increase more than those in summer, with major impacts on everything from winter recreation to increased pests and challenges to harvesting for the forestry industry. Beyond this general warming trend, Massachusetts will experience an increasing number of days with extreme heat in the future (Table 3). Generally, extreme heat is considered to be over 90 degrees F, because at temperatures above that threshold, heat-related illnesses and mortality show a marked increase. Extreme heat can be especially damaging in urban areas, where there is often a concentration of vulnerable populations, and where more impervious surfaces such as streets and parking lots 8 NOAA National Centers for Environmental information, Climate at a Glance: U.S. Time Series, Average Temperature, published December 2017, retrieved on December 21, 2017 from http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/and less vegetation cause a “heat island” effect that makes them hotter compared to neighboring rural areas. Urban residents in Massachusetts – especially those who are very young, ill, or elderly, and those who live in older buildings without air conditioning – will face greater risks of serious heat-related illnesses when extreme heat becomes more common. Extreme heat and dry conditions or drought could also be detrimental to crop production, harvest and livestock. While warmer winters may reduce burdens on energy systems, more heat in the summer may put larger demands on aging systems, creating the potential for power outages. The number of cooling degree days is expected to increase significantly by the end of the century adding to this strain. In addition, heat can directly stress transmission lines, substations, train tracks, roads and bridges, and other critical infrastructure. Impacts from Changing Precipitation Conditions Rainfall is expected to increase in spring and winter months in particular in Massachusetts, with increasing consecutive dry days in summer and fall. More total rainfall can have an impact on the frequency of minor but disruptive flooding events, especially in areas where storm water infrastructure has not been adequately sized to accommodate higher levels. Increased total rainfall will also affect agriculture, forestry and natural ecosystems. More intense downpours often lead to inland flooding as soils become saturated and stop absorbing more water, river flows rise, and the capacity of urban storm water systems is exceeded. Flooding may occur as a result of heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or coastal flooding associated with high wind and wave action, but precipitation is the strongest driver of flooding in Massachusetts. Winter flooding is also common in the state, particularly when the ground is frozen. The Commonwealth experienced 22 flood-related disaster declarations from 1954 to 2017 with many of these falling in winter or early spring, or during recent hurricanes. The climate projections suggest that the frequency of high-intensity rainfall events will trend upward. Overall, it is anticipated that the severity of flood-inducing weather events and storms will increase, with events that produce sufficient precipitation to present a risk of flooding likely increasing. A single intense downpour can cause flooding and widespread damage to property and critical infrastructure. The coast will experience the greatest increase in high-intensity rainfall days, but some level of increase will occur in every area of Massachusetts. Intense rainfall in urbanized areas can cause pollutants on roads and parking lots to get washed into nearby rivers and lakes, reducing habitat quality. As rainfall and snowfall patterns change, certain habitats and species that have specific physiological requirements may be affected.Climate projections for Massachusetts indicate that in future decades, winter precipitation could increase, but by the end of the century most of this precipitation is likely to fall as rain instead of snow due to warmer winters. There are many human and environmental impacts that could result from this change including reduced snow cover for winter recreation and tourism, less spring snow melt to replenish aquifers, higher levels of winter runoff, and lower spring river flows for aquatic ecosystems. A small projected decrease in average summer precipitation in Massachusetts could combine with higher temperatures to increase the frequency of episodic droughts, like the one experienced across the Commonwealth in the summer of 2016. Droughts will create challenges for local water supply by reducing surface water storage and the recharge of groundwater supplies, including private wells. More frequent droughts could also exacerbate the impacts of flood events by damaging vegetation that could otherwise help mitigate flooding impacts. Droughts may also weaken tree root systems, making them more susceptible to toppling during high wind events.Table 5: Statewide projected changes of temperature and precipitation variables by the middle and end of the century, based on climate models and the medium and high pathways of future greenhouse gas emissions.

        "Section 1 Introduction 1.1 Goal and Purpose of the Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan This Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan (NHMP) provides documentation of a natural hazard mitigation planning process to immediately integrate community‐derived priorities and identify actions to reduce risk and build resilience in the City of Melrose. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)1, a NHMP enables communities to:  Increase education and awareness around threats, hazards, and vulnerabilities;  Build partnerships for risk reduction involving government, organizations, businesses, and the public;  Identify long‐term, broadly‐supported strategies for risk reduction;  Align risk reduction with other state, tribal, or community objectives;  Identify implementation approaches that focus resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities; and  Communicate priorities to potential sources of funding. The goal of this NHMP is to identify both known and potential risks from current and future natural hazards and to develop, through the community planning process, actions to reduce the risk from these hazards. Each of these hazard mitigation actions is intended to either mitigate the susceptibility of the community to a natural hazard or to better prepare the City of Melrose to protect and manage the community in the occurrence of a natural hazard. Implementing these actions can reduce the risk of loss of life and property in Melrose by lessening the impact of natural hazards. Further, having an up‐to‐date NHMP approved by FEMA for the City of Melrose makes the City eligible for non‐disaster funding and assistance from FEMA to implement actions outlined in this NHMP. All hazard mitigation actions are contingent on funding and those identified as responsible for implementing actions are also responsible for obtaining funding. The NHMP process was led by the Melrose Department of Public Works and included input from community representatives, the public, and regional partners (Section 2). The 2017 Master Plan, “Melrose Forward” specifically recommended updating the NHMP; this plan fulfills that action item2. This NHMP will serve as the primary resilience planning document for the City of Melrose. 1 These benefits are directly from FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Planning website: https://www.fema.gov/hazard‐mitigation‐planning 2 Melrose Forward: A Community Vision and Master Plan. 2017.

        "Section 1  Introduction 1.1.1 Role of the 2004 Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan Melrose last developed a NHMP in 2004. Many of the natural hazard mitigation actions from the 2004 plan have been implemented and have resulted in a reduced risk of flooding in certain parts of Melrose. The findings and lessons learned from the 2004 plan have been incorporated into this plan, as appropriate. Details on the status of actions from the 2004 plan are summarized in Section 5.1. 1.1.2 Overlap and Integration of the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Program Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) launched the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) grant program in 2016. This program provides grants to cities and towns in Massachusetts to begin planning for climate change and taking action to increase resiliency. The City of Melrose was awarded a $19,000 MVP planning grant from EEA to conduct Community Resilience Building (CRB) workshops in the City. Conducting the workshops allowed Melrose to achieve “MVP” designation from the Commonwealth – a designation that gives the City access to further funding to implement resilient actions. The City capitalized on the opportunity to integrate both the MVP and NHMP planning processes into one resilience document. This follows the Commonwealth’s lead of including the impacts from climate change as natural hazards. In September 2018, Massachusetts adopted a first of its kind State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP). 1.2 Brief History of Melrose Melrose was originally called “Ponde Fielde” because of the many ponds and streams located around the region. It was considered part of Charlestown until the mid‐1600s. As the 18th century progressed, the small village, then known as the North End of Malden (North Malden), began to grow as a prosperous farming community. After the American Revolution in 1776, trades people, merchants, shoe makers, and innkeepers began to settle in the village. North Malden remained a thinly populated area, despite the established trade market that emerged in neighboring Boston. In 1845 the Boston and Maine Railroad built a track through North Malden. Overnight, the quiet village of North Malden became populated by those who worked in Boston but wanted to escape the crowded metropolis of the big city for fresh air and open spaces. The population boomed when three railroad stations (Wyoming, Cedar Park, and Melrose Highlands) were constructed allowing an easier commute for residents to the city. North Malden, upon reaching a condition of self‐sufficiency in 1889, established itself as the City of Melrose. Parks and schools were constructed, police and fire services were instituted, and three distinct shopping districts allowed the residents in the city to rely on the goods and services provided exclusively by locals. Today Melrose prospers with its ideal location between Boston and Route 128. The City is now more self‐sufficient than ever by providing what is necessary to support its residents’ housing, education, health care, employment, shopping, entertainment, recreation, and leisure needs. 1‐2",
        "Section 1  Introduction 1.3 Environmental Setting Melrose is an idyllic, small New England city located 7 miles north of Boston. The City is approximately 4.76 square miles of total land area with nearly 28,000 residents. Main Street in the heart of downtown Melrose has a Victorian feel with buildings dating back to the mid to late 1800s. Ell Pond dominates the landscape in the center of the City with a gazebo, walking trails and scenic views. The Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development calls Melrose a “garden city” since trees line its streets, and parks and open space are spread out through and around the City. The “green belt” of surrounding communities, including the Middlesex Falls Reservation to the west, provides a natural buffer from more urban communities beyond. The residential areas of Melrose are diverse in both architectural style and in the density of its population. Historic neighborhoods are located in the more urban areas near downtown, with newer development near the Mount Hood golf course. Culture and recreation play a role in the everyday lives of the citizens of Melrose. The City is proud of its 100‐year old Melrose Symphony Orchestra, while its many parks and open spaces provide residents a place to exercise, play, or relax with friends. 1.4 Changes in Development since the 2004 Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan Since the development of the 2004 Plan, Melrose has been featured as the “hottest ZIP code” in the United States and one of the “Best Small Cities in America.” Melrose continues to be a desirable place to live, with a strong economic base, a multitude of transportation options, and valued parks and open space for all to enjoy. These are positive advances for the City that come with challenges such as limited housing inventory and keeping housing costs affordable. The City is falling short on the amount of subsidized housing available, according to the Commonwealth’s standards. Melrose continues to look at options for increasing housing production and reducing barriers to creating new housing units. The City has placed a priority on improving facilities and infrastructure in Melrose, implementing many of the action outlined in the 2004 NHMP and improving operational facilities management. Melrose Veterans Memorial Middle School, the Melrose High School, the Milano Senior Center, and other facilities have been rebuilt or upgraded to better standards. The details of this progress is detailed in Section 5. The City has been designated a Green Community by the Commonwealth, has substantially reduced energy use and related greenhouse gas emissions, and has saved on energy costs. 1‐3",

        "Section 2 The Planning Process 2.1 Community Team The NHMP team was led by the Public Works Department, with input and guidance from the Office of Planning and Community Development and support from the Mayor’s Office. A Community Team consisting of public officials, regional organizations, neighboring communities and residents were engaged throughout the planning process and provided a broad spectrum of local knowledge and experience to inform this NHMP for the City of Melrose. Details on the Community Team participants (and those who were invited) and the methods for soliciting and receiving input from them are provided in the following sections. 2.2 Process for Public Input and Feedback The public planning process was led by the Melrose Department of Public Works and their consulting firm, CDM Smith. There were four primary methods by which the City received input: 1. MVP Workshops held in April 2018 with community representatives with additional assistance of the Planning Department; 2. NHMP Community Input and MVP Public Listening Session held on June 21, 2018 for the general public; 3. Regional Input meeting held on September 25, 2018 with regional partners; and 4. Public meeting held on March 11, 2019, including the release of a draft of this plan a week prior to this meeting. Details of each of these processes are below. Through this series of workshops and meetings, the public gave input to this NHMP on natural hazards, areas of concern, vulnerabilities and strengths in Melrose, and plans for future mitigation activities and priorities. The methods of soliciting feedback are described further below and results of feedback received from these public planning activities can be found in Appendix A. The City requested participation from community representatives and regional partners via direct emails. Public participation was encouraged through meeting notices posted on the City’s website and Mayor Infurna’s blog. 2.2.1 Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Workshops The MVP workshops’ central objectives were to:  Define top local natural and climate‐related hazards of concern;  Identify existing and future strengths and vulnerabilities;  Develop prioritized actions for the community; and 2‐1",
        "Section 2  The Planning Process  Identify immediate opportunities to collaboratively advance actions to increase resilience. Participates were asked to complete a brief online survey, which focuses on how the community currently perceives, assesses, and acts to reduce risks to which informed the workshops (see Appendix A). The workshops were held on April 5 and 11, 2018 from 8:45am – 1:00pm at Mount Hood Golf Course in Melrose. The first workshop began with a large group discussion on the hazards that face the community that will be impacted by climate change. Smaller multi‐ disciplinary groups then prioritized the top four hazards, identified and prioritized the societal, infrastructure and environmental vulnerabilities impacted by the hazards. At the second workshop, hazard mitigation actions were developed to address the vulnerabilities. This information was captured in risk matrices for each small group. Hazard mitigation actions were prioritized by small working group and were presented to the larger group for comprehensive prioritization, determined by participant voting. The priorities set during this process reflect the importance of the hazard, vulnerability, and mitigation strategy to participant’s organization and the magnitude of the impacts to the society, infrastructure, and environmental assets in Melrose. Qualitative magnitude of benefits and costs were considered in the final prioritization of mitigation strategies. This information was captured by meeting scribes and summarized in the MVP plan in Appendix A. The leadership and core team members for planning and facilitating the MVP process were:  Gail Infurna, Mayor of Melrose  Martha Grover, Energy Efficiency Manager / Table Facilitator  Elena Proakis Ellis, City Engineer / Table Facilitator  John Scenna, Director of Public Works  Lauren Miller, Lead Facilitator / Consultant Team, CDM Smith  Lauren Klonsky, Table Facilitator / Consultant Team, CDM Smith  Workshop scribes: Scott Dixon (Department of Public Works), Amy Heidebrecht (Department of Public Works), Lori Massa (Office of Planning and Community Development) Community representatives that were invited via email by Mayor Infurna and participated in the process are shown in Table 2‐1. 2‐2",

The purpose of the meeting was to present the City’s readiness to handle climate‐related events and emergencies, to discuss how we can become more prepared, and to hear suggestions and feedback from the community on this important topic. The meeting was open to the entire community and served as both a forum for the community to provide input on the development of this NHMP and the required MVP “public listening session.” A notice for this meeting was published on the City’s events calendar prior to the meeting here: https://www.cityofmelrose.org/home/events/10693. Mayor Infurna posted the notice in her blog at: https://mayorinfurna.wordpress.com/2018/06/14/preparing‐for‐extreme‐weather‐ events‐a‐listening‐session‐on‐june‐21/ Community feedback was received from participants through a facilitated discussion of the MVP process and findings. Participants were also given the opportunity to submit their feedback in writing on hazards and actions to reduce vulnerabilities. Hazard mitigation strategies were prioritized by participant voting. This information was captured by meeting scribes and summarized in the MVP plan (Appendix A). Additional vulnerabilities and hazard mitigation strategies that were identified at this meeting has been incorporated into this plan and included in Section 6. Meeting materials may be found in Appendix A, including an agenda, list of attendees, populated feedback questionnaires, and results of participant voting. 2.2.3 NHMP Regional Input The City held a regional input meeting for this NHMP to provide an opportunity for local and neighboring community partners to give input to the process. The City gained insight on regionally‐focused hazard mitigation strategies and opportunities that could improve the City’s resilience. The meeting was held on September 25, 2018 from 1:00pm‐3:00pm at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Melrose. Verbal input from the group discussion was captured from meeting participants in the form of meeting notes, which may be found in Appendix A. Input from the regional stakeholders was incorporated into this plan by considering additional vulnerabilities and hazard mitigation strategies identified by participants and included in Sections 4 and 6 of this document. Meeting materials such as the meeting agenda, presentation, sign‐in sheet, and meeting notes may also be found in Appendix A.

Feedback received at the forum has been incorporated into the plan. The City is committed to keeping the public engaged in the ongoing process of natural hazard mitigation to improve resilience in Melrose. 2‐5",
        "Section 3 Natural Hazard Risks 3.1 Introduction to Natural Hazards A natural hazard is defined by the World Bank as a physical process or event (hydro‐ meteorological or oceanographic variables or phenomena) that can harm human health, livelihoods, or natural resources.1 Natural hazards can include atmospheric, hydrologic, geologic, and wildfire events whose incidence or intensity humans have little to no control over. However, humans play an important role in the preparation and response to various natural hazards, resulting in the potential reduction of losses and harmful impacts to human life and/or the physical environment. This section considers the natural hazards identified in the 2013 Massachusetts HMP2 and discusses their applicability to Melrose. It also presents FEMA disaster declarations in Middlesex County since 2001 in each hazard category. In addition, projected climate change impacts have been incorporated into the hazards considered herein, expanding upon the work that was conducted in spring 2018 as part of the City’s MVP process. 3.1.1 Climate Change Interaction with Natural Hazards Climate change continues to be a contributing factor to the frequency and intensity of the natural hazards described below, with the exception of earthquakes and major urban fires.3 As part of the MVP process, the EEA summarized the existing and expected future climate conditions by major watershed in the Commonwealth. Melrose falls into two watersheds; however, the majority of the City is in the Boston Harbor Basin. Therefore, projections from this basin were used as a basis for discussing future climate change in the City. The key takeaways4 from the EEA on the future climate conditions are:  Regardless of geographic scale, rising temperatures, changing precipitation, and extreme weather will continue to affect the people and resources of the Commonwealth.  Average, maximum, and minimum temperatures are expected to increase; seasonally, maximum summer and fall temperatures are expected to see the highest projected increase and minimum winter and fall temperatures are expected to increase. 1 Source: World Bank: https://climatescreeningtools.worldbank.org/content/key‐terms‐0 2 This NHMP was developed at the same time as the 2018 Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP). Melrose used draft information from its development to inform this plan. It may be found at: https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/10/26/SHMCAP‐September2018‐ Full‐Plan‐web.pdf 3 Dam failures are not directly related to climate change; however, changes in precipitation patterns or storm events may impact a dam’s ability properly function. 4 These impacts are taken directly from the document provided by EEA to MVP communities in December 2017 entitled “Massachusetts Climate Change Projections.” 3‐1",
        "Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks  The number of days receiving precipitation over one inch are variable, fluctuating between loss and gain of days.  Seasonal projections for total precipitation are also variable for the Boston Harbor basin. The winter season is expected to experience the greatest change with an increase of 0‐20% by mid‐century, and 3‐34% by end of century.  Annual and seasonal projections for consecutive dry days, or for a given period, are variable.  Precipitation will be more variable. “Extreme” precipitation events are likely to occur more often. 3.2 Natural Hazards in Melrose This NHMP update focuses on natural hazards of concern as identified through a review of previous City of Melrose and Commonwealth of Massachusetts HMPs, as well as through information collected via the MVP and public comment processes conducted during plan development. The identified hazards of concern are flooding, severe weather, fire, earthquake, and invasive species. Table 3‐1 below lists these natural hazards, along with subsections describing the detail of each hazard of concern and the source of identification for inclusion in this NHMP. Table 3‐1.

        "Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks Risk is defined by the World Bank as the potential for consequences where something is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain.5 The 2013 Massachusetts HMP categorizes natural hazards by the frequency of occurrence, severity, and area of impact, to understand the magnitude of risk posed by these natural hazards to the Commonwealth. It is assumed that these are the same in Melrose as they are for the Commonwealth under current conditions. However, due to climate change, the frequency and the likely severity of natural hazards may be impacted. This is summarized in Table 3‐2. These are defined as follows6:  Frequency of Occurrence:  Very low: Events that occur less often than once in 100 years (less than 1% probability per year)  Low: Events that occur from once in 50 years to once in 100 years (1% to 2% probability per year)  Medium: Events that occur from once in 5 years to once in 50 years (2% to 20% probability per year)  High: Events that occur more frequently than once in 5 years (greater than 20% probability per year)  Severity (or Impact):  Minor: Limited and scattered property damage, limited damage to public infrastructure and essential services not interrupted, limited injuries or fatalities.  Serious: Scattered major property damage, some minor infrastructure damage, essential services are briefly interrupted, some injuries and/or fatalities.  Extensive: Widespread major property damage, major public infrastructure damage (up to several days for repairs), essential services are interrupted from several hours to several days, many injuries and/or fatalities.  Catastrophic: Property and public infrastructure destroyed, essential services stopped, numerous injuries and fatalities.  Area of Impact (extent of impact on any locality for a particular event):  Minor: Limited and scattered property damage, limited damage to public infrastructure and essential services not interrupted, limited injuries or fatalities. 5 Source: World Bank: https://climatescreeningtools.worldbank.org/content/key‐terms‐0 6 2013 State Hazard Mitigation Plan, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

The frequency is categorized in that plan as “ongoing” as invasive species do not occur at specific moments. The severity and area of impact were assigned to the best extent possible. 3.2.1 Flooding Flooding, the overflow of large volumes of water beyond the usual boundaries, can be caused by various factors. The City of Melrose is most likely to experience floods related to inland riverine overflows, urban drainage issues, and infrastructure or ground failures. Severe weather largely coincides with significant flood events within the City of Melrose and surrounding areas. Heavy rainstorms, nor’easters, tropical storms, and hurricanes have the potential to cause overbank flooding or flash floods. 3‐4",
        "Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks Areas most susceptible to flooding include riverine corridors and urban areas with natural and structural characteristics that reduce soil infiltration rates and increase surface runoff during significant precipitation events. Steep stream banks and urban drainage systems increase runoff rates and channel stormwater to area rivers and streams, resulting in the potential for flooding to occur more quickly and reach greater depths.7 Finally, large rain events and the resulting inflow and infiltration into the sanitary sewer system have the potential to cause sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and sewer pump station failures. The extent of the 100‐year flood, 500‐year flood, and other flood hazard areas are identified and discussed further in Sections 4 and 5 and on Figure 5‐1. 3.2.1.1 Dam Failure Flooding can also be caused by significant structural catastrophes such as dam failure. A dam is a constructed barrier intended to obstruct or control the flow of water. Dam failures can be caused by a number of natural and non‐natural factors including dam capacity exceedance, material or structural failure, foundation movement or cracking of concrete or embankment, piping or erosion issues, inadequate operation and maintenance, and/or deliberate acts of sabotage. Earthquakes, landslides, extreme storms, and massive snowmelt may also contribute to the occurrence of dam failures.8 There are two dam systems in Stoneham near the border of Melrose managed by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority that pose a potential hazard to the City ‐ Fells Reservoir Dams and the Spot Pond Dam. The Fells Reservoir Dams are considered high hazard and significant hazard dams by MWRA with 63 million gallons of storage. These classifications do not reflect the dam condition, rather the proximity to residents. The Spot Dams, considered as a significant hazard class by MWRA are earthen embankment with 2,500 million gallons of storage. If these dams were to fail, million gallons of water could inundate the and cause significant flood damage to City of Melrose.9 3.2.1.2 Landslide A landslide occurs when there is any type of ground movement along a steep gradient caused by falling rocks or increased driving forces. The cohesive strength of soils making up a steep slope can become unstable and fail for various reasons. The most common cause of landslide occurrences is the oversaturation of soils from precipitation and water level changes (groundwater or surface water). Flooding, for example, can result in the oversaturation of soils and raise groundwater and surface water levels in a short period of time. Water saturation along a steep gradient would add weight to the slope while pore pressure increases, resulting in the decreased strength of earth materials ultimately causing slope failure. Additional factors that may cause a landslide include undercutting due to high surface flows, construction related causes, 7 2004 City of Melrose Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan, Section 2 8 2013 State Hazard Mitigation Plan, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

This may occur throughout the City, however the Commonwealth categorizes this as a low probability and low impact hazard. 3.2.2 Severe Weather Severe weather includes any critical or dangerous meteorological event that may potentially cause significant losses to public or private property, the environment, or human life. Some severe weather events may also result in flooding, as described in the previous section. Defined below are the severe weather events of concern for the City of Melrose. 3.2.2.1 High Wind The National Weather Service (NWS)10 defines high winds as sustained surface winds of 40 miles per hour (mph) or greater for at least one hour, or wind gusts of 58 mph or greater for any duration of time. The most common high wind impacts include surface damage to natural and manmade structures including downed trees and power lines and damaged roofs, windows, and siding. Power outages may occur during high wind events, especially after prolonged dry periods or periods of excessive rainfall as tree root systems are weakened and the occurrence of downed trees damaging power lines becomes more prominent. High winds are generally a component of several other types of weather events including tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, hurricanes, tropical storms, and nor’easters. Historical occurrences of these other types of weather events associated with high winds are listed in Section 3.4. 3.2.2.2 Thunderstorm Thunderstorms are rain‐ or hail‐bearing storms that produce lightning and thunder. Thunderstorms are generally more common in spring and summer months as warmer temperatures allow for convection of hot air (the transfer of hot air to higher atmospheres). The moisture from rising hot air begins to cool at higher elevations in the atmosphere resulting in cloud development. As those clouds continue to rise and eventually reach below freezing conditions, water molecules continue to cool or freeze creating rain or hail. Interactions between cooled water molecules produce the electricity that forms lightning.11 Severe thunderstorms are defined by the NWS as any storm causing 58 mph winds or greater, a storm producing hail at least 1‐inch in diameter, or a tornado‐producing storm.12 Heavy rainfall and high winds produced by a severe thunderstorm have the potential to cause flooding and high wind damages as discussed in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.1. 10 National Weather Service Advisory Definitions.

Governor declared a State of Day Storm”) flooding) Emergency during time of event, and the President declared major disaster status for those affected. For some locations, this was the worst flooding recorded since the 1938 Hurricane and the great rain/snowmelt floods of 1936. A total of 8 to 12 inches of rainfall accumulated during this storm event. Property damages throughout the County were estimated to reach approximately $5M due to damages from this storm.

October 25, Thunderstorm Melrose Storm front stalled over the region producing 2 to 2017 (heavy rain, 6.5 inches of rainfall within 24 hours. Storm caused high wind, strong winds with speeds reaching 45‐55 mph and flooding) widespread urban and poor drainage flooding. Most notable flooding in Melrose occurred at the intersection of Larchmont Road and Porter Street. 3.2.2.3 Tornado Tornadoes are considered the most violent of all atmospheric storms that have the potential to cause catastrophic damage in localized areas without significant warning. Tornadoes are formed if the following components are present14:  Strong winds in the mid to upper levels of the atmosphere  Clockwise turning of wind, visible from the dust and debris caught in the rotation  Increasing wind speeds in the lowest 10,000 feet of the atmosphere  Warm, moist air near the ground surface with unusually cool air above the surface  A forcing mechanism such as a cold front or leftover weather boundary from a previous severe weather event 13 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Storm Events Database.

        "Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks The Enhanced Fujita Tornado Scale (EF Scale) is used by the NWS to assign a tornado severity rating based on the damage caused on the ground and the associated estimated wind speeds. When tornado‐related damage is surveyed, it is compared to a list of damage indicators (DIs) and degrees of damage (DoD) which help estimate the range of wind speeds the tornado likely produced. This is done for several structures, then a final rating from EF0 to EF5 is assigned. Tables 3‐4 and 3‐5 list the EF Scale wind speeds and damage indicators.15 Table 3‐4.

        "Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks 3.2.2.4 Tropical Storm and Hurricane Tropical storms are defined as numerous thunderstorms with a low‐pressure, warm center that produce strong winds and heavy rains, but at lower wind‐speeds than a hurricane. Tropical storms are generally formed in tropical coastal areas where water evaporated from the ocean saturates the air, resulting in condensation of water vapor and the formation of tropical storm clouds. Both tropical storms and hurricanes have a cyclonic nature resulting from the Coriolis force, with counterclockwise wind flow in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise wind flow in the Southern Hemisphere. The size of a tropical storm or cyclone is measured by the distance from its center of circulation to its outermost isobar and can range from very small (138 miles) to very large (552 miles).19 The greatest threats associated with tropical storms are impacts from heavy rainfall and flooding, as well as the potential for tornado formation and power outages. High winds are not as big of a threat but can still cause damage to a lesser degree. Generally, tropical storms lose strength as they move inland further from the ocean, which provides the primary source of energy for the storm. However, storm surges caused by tropical storms along the coastline can potentially reach up to 25 miles inland, putting the City of Melrose at risk. Hurricanes are similar to tropical storms in their formation and movement patterns, however a hurricane has the potential to be much more powerful and damaging than a tropical storm due to higher wind speeds and the greater likelihood of flooding from storm surges and heavy rainfall. Hurricanes begin as tropical storms and are categorized as a hurricane once wind speeds reach a sustained speed of 74 mph or greater.20 The Saffir‐Simpson scale, shown in Table 3‐6, ranks hurricanes on a scale of 1 to 5 based on wind speed. Table 3‐6. Saffir‐Simpson Hurricane Scale21 Category Wind Speed (mph) Potential Damage 1 74 – 95 Minimal: Damage is primarily to vegetation, mobile homes, and some signs. No real damage is done to larger structures. 2 96 – 110 Moderate: Some downed trees, damaged roof coverings, and major damage to mobile homes 3 111 – 130 Extensive: Large downed trees, some structural damage to roofs, destroyed mobile homes, and structural damage to small homes and utilities 4 131 – 155 Extreme: Extensive damage to roofs, windows, and doors, roof systems on small buildings completely fail, and some failed curtain walls 5 155 + Catastrophic: Considerable and widespread roof damage, severe damage to windows and doors, extensive glass failures, and potential for entire buildings to fail 19 2013 State Hazard Mitigation Plan, Commonwealth of Massachusetts Website Accessed on 10/2/18; https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/01/mp/massachusetts‐state‐hazard‐mitigation‐plan.pdf 20 National Weather Service Advisory Definitions.

        "Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks Tropical storms and hurricanes that develop in the Cape Verde Islands or in the Bahamas have the potential to reach coastal New England and impact the City of Melrose, which is near the coast of the Atlantic Ocean; Mount Hood Golf Course is located only 0.75 miles from Rumney Marsh Reservation and less than three miles from Revere Beach. Isolated tornadoes are also a threat during a hurricane as powerful funnel clouds can form along the outer bands of the hurricane as much as 15 hours prior to the landfall of the hurricane itself. Hurricane season for the City of Melrose and the New England region is from June to November; however, most hurricanes on record in the area have occurred between August and October.22 3.2.2.5 Snow and Blizzard Snow is a form of frozen precipitation that requires atmospheric temperatures to be below freezing from the ground surface to the cloud level. A total of approximately ten inches of snow is equivalent to one inch of rain depending on the snow‐liquid ratio of the snow. Snow storms producing sustained winds of 35 mph or greater with only a quarter‐mile of visibility for at least 3 hours are considered blizzards.23 Severe blizzards produce winds upwards of 45 mph at or below 10° F.24 High winds during a severe blizzard blow falling snow or accumulated snow from the ground surface enough to reduce visibility to near zero. Hazards associated with snow storms and blizzards include potential flooding from snowmelt, dangerous travel conditions, and cold stress. The City of Melrose receives approximately 48 to 72 inches of snow annually.25 According to NOAA, there have been 93 days with either blizzards, heavy snow, winter storms, or winter weather conditions between 2005 and the 2017‐2018 winter season in Middlesex County.26 3.2.2.6 Nor’easter Nor’easters are damaging and forceful winter storms that generally occur between October and May. A nor’easter is characterized as a large, counter‐clockwise cyclonic storm with strong northeasterly winds ranging from 20 to 60 mph. These winter storms produce significant amounts of snow and/or rain with the potential for wind gusts exceeding hurricane force intensity. Nor’easter storms tend to remain stationary for several days and have historically occurred more frequently than hurricanes, intensifying the potential risks and impacts caused by heavy precipitation and high winds.27 Powerful nor’easters could cause billions of dollars in damages along with severe economic, transportation, and human disruption from flooding, blocked roads, and unsafe travel conditions.

Additionally, trees and power lines may be pulled down due to the excess weight of ice accumulation. Freezing precipitation could also be in the form of sleet or ice pellets. Ice pellets are formed when a snowflake melts as it passes through warmer atmospheric air and then refreezes into ice as it approaches colder temperatures near the ground.30 Table 3‐7 includes information about the only ice storm on record in Middlesex County between 2004 and 2018 according to the NOAA storm events database.31 Table 3‐7.

Summer 2016 Severe Drought (D2) Severe drought designated for Middlesex County in July Extreme Drought (D3) 2016. Continued dry conditions through the month of August extended the drought designation through the summer. The U.S. Drought Monitor continued the Severe Drought (D2) designation in southeastern Middlesex County through August 16th. It was upgraded to an Extreme Drought (D3) designation at that time, which continued through the end of August. Fall 2016 Extreme Drought (D3) The U.S. Drought Monitor continued the Extreme Drought (D3) designation in southeastern Middlesex County from September ‐ November. Winter 2016‐2017 Extreme Drought (D3) Severe The U.S. Drought Monitor continued the Extreme Drought Drought (D2) Moderate (D3) designation in southeastern Middlesex County through Drought (D1) December.

        "Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks 3.2.3 Fire There are two different types of fire events that may adversely impact the City of Melrose, 1) major urban fires, and 2) wildfires. Both types of fires are discussed in greater detail below. 3.2.3.1 Major Urban Fire Major urban fires are defined as any type of large, uncontrollable fire that occurs in an urban area and causes significant destruction. The cause of major urban fires is more often related to other hazards such as storms, earthquakes, gas leaks, car accidents, hazardous material spills, terrorism, or criminal activity.36 Smaller urban fires are generally related to cooking, smoking, or equipment/appliance malfunctions. The greatest risk related to any type of urban fire is the proximity to human life and the high cost of damage mitigation to the communities affected by the fire. There have been recent examples of major urban fires in communities near Melrose over the past several years, although none within Melrose City limits. One of which was related the gas explosions in the Merrimack Valley in September 2018. This event led to extensive damage, 21 people transported to the hospital, and one death in Lawrence, North Andover, and Andover, Massachusetts; the event required mutual aid from surrounding municipalities and state37. 3.2.3.2 Wildfire Wildfires include fires that occur in undeveloped, vegetated or forested areas and are caused by natural events or by human activity. Wildfires generally begin small and unnoticed due to their rural location, but have the potential to spread quickly, especially during dry, high wind conditions. Wildfires are classified into three different categories38:  Surface fire: Most common type that burns along the forest floor and moves slowly killing or damaging all trees it comes into contact with  Ground fire: Usually occurs during drought conditions and burns the organic materials on the forest floor  Crown fire: Spreads rapidly due to high winds causing flames to jump along treetops. Wildfire season in the City of Melrose and surrounding areas is during the drier, spring and summer months. Snowpack levels and local weather conditions including droughts have a significant impact on the likelihood and intensity of wildfires in the area, though there have been no wildfires in Middlesex County since 2004. 36 2013 State Hazard Mitigation Plan, Commonwealth of Massachusetts Website Accessed on 10/2/18; https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/01/mp/massachusetts‐state‐hazard‐mitigation‐plan.pdf 37 National Transportation Safety Board, Preliminary Report Pipeline.

        "Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks 3.2.4 Earthquake Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates on the earth’s outer crust develop faults or fractures and slide against or into each other resulting in the movement and vibration of the earth’s surface. Earthquakes can range from mild to very violent and destructive events that have the potential to cause significant structural damage and failure. Earthquake activity in the ocean may cause large waves or tsunamis that have the potential to flood adjacent coastal areas. Additionally, soft soils may intensify structural damage caused by inland earthquakes and increase the potential losses resulting from a strong quake. According to the US Geological Survey website, there have been two magnitude 2.5 earthquakes according the Richter Scale (see Table 3‐11) in the state of Massachusetts since 2004, neither of which impacted the City of Melrose.39 The Richter scale measures the strength of earthquakes based on the waves recorded by seismographs. A magnitude 2.5 earthquake is considered minor because they do not result in damage to buildings even if they are felt by people. Table 3‐11. Richter Scale for Earthquake Magnitude40 Magnitude Description 1.0 ‐ 3.0 Not felt except by a very few under especially favorable conditions. 3.0 ‐ 3.9 Felt quite noticeably by persons indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings. Many people do not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing motor cars may rock slightly. Vibrations similar to the passing of a truck. Duration estimated. 4.0 ‐ 4.9 Felt indoors by many during the day. At night, some or many are awakened. Dishes, windows, doors disturbed or broken; walls make cracking sound.

        "Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks 3.2.5 Invasive Species The draft 2018 SHMCAP identifies invasive species as a natural hazard for the first time.41‐ The City has chosen to include this natural hazard in the evaluation as it is a hazard of concern in Melrose. These effects may be City‐wide, potentially covering all 3,036 acres of land. The NOAA defines invasive species as any organism that can cause ecological or economic harm in a new environment where it is not native.42 Invasive species are generally spread unintentionally through accidental transport on water vessels or on the clothing, shoes, or luggage of traveling individuals. Occasionally, invasive species are introduced intentionally for garden landscaping purposes or through disposal of unwanted aquatic pets in local waterways. Invasive plant, animal, or aquatic species have the potential to outcompete native organisms for nourishment and/or shelter, potentially causing significant ecosystem changes and reduced biodiversity. Invasive plant species from the list included in the SHMCAP have the potential to be found in the City of Melrose today and in the future. Table 3‐12 lists the SHMCAP invasive species that have the potential to impact the Melrose area according to the City’s Conservation Commission Agent. Table 3‐12.

The waves become larger as they approach landfall, potentially causing significant flooding and destruction to coastal areas. Extreme tsunami events could reach up to 10 miles inland depending on the shape and slope of the shoreline, as well as the elevation changes as you move further inland. The probability of Melrose being impacted by a tsunami is very low. The City’s distance from the coastline and fact that open space is the nearest point to the ocean (Mount Hood Golf course) provides a means of defense against the initial destructive impact of a tsunami wave. If Melrose were to be impacted, flooding would be minimal and could be addressed using the same mitigation strategies as for other flooding events. 3.3.2 Coastal Hazards Coastal hazards include erosion and sea‐level rise. High energy storms and flooding along the coast present a risk for land erosion over time depending on the intensity and frequency of storms. Additionally, climate change impacts will ultimately lead to changes in sea‐levels, making coastal areas the most susceptible to inundation. However, the City of Melrose is 0.75 miles from Rumney Marsh Reservation and over two miles from the Revere Beach coastline, therefore any impacts from such hazards are not of great concern. 3‐17",
        "Section 3  Natural Hazard Risks 3.4 Recent Disaster Declarations The City of Melrose and the surrounding communities of Middlesex County have experienced 23 FEMA‐declared disaster events since 1991 from natural hazard events. Each event has caused significant damages to the affected communities and some events resulted in fatalities. A disaster declaration occurs when the Governor of the affected state requests federal assistance because a severe event exceeds the response capabilities and resources of the local and state governments. A preliminary damage assessment (PDA) is completed by jurisdictional officials to estimate the magnitude of the impact the disaster caused upon communities. The PDA provides supporting documentation that federal assistance is necessary for a specific event. Table 3‐13 identifies all declared disasters in Middlesex County since 1991. The table includes additional incident information such as the type of event, the duration, and a brief description. The majority of incidents impact multiple counties and states, and therefore the incident dates account for the entire time interval the disaster event occurs (not only the time it impacted Middlesex County).43 Table 3‐13 FEMA‐Declared Disaster Events for Middlesex County (1991‐2018) FEMA Incident FEMA Date Incident Dates Incident Description Disaster Type Declared Number March 13, 2018 The third nor'easter to hit Massachusetts in a Nor'easter to three‐week timeframe, which produced up to 4379 7/19/2018 March 14, 2018 two feet of snow.

        "Section 4 Vulnerability Assessment 4.1 Vulnerability Assessment Overview Conducting a vulnerability assessment enables Melrose to preemptively identify how natural hazards may impact the City and take appropriate actions to reduce the severity of the impact. A qualitative vulnerability assessment for the purposes of this plan evaluated the natural hazard categories of flooding, severe weather, fire, earthquake, and invasive species in terms of the impacts to infrastructure, societal, and environmental assets to remain consistent with the MVP process. The assessment considers the exposure and sensitivity of an asset to the natural hazards to determine the vulnerability. The World Bank1 defines these terms as:  Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, infrastructure, species or ecosystems, environmental services and resources, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places that could be adversely affected by a hazard.  Sensitivity: The degree to which a system, asset, or species may be affected, either adversely or beneficially, when exposed to climate variability or change or geophysical hazards.  Vulnerability: The potential effects of hazards on human or natural assets and systems. These potential effects, which are determined by both exposure and sensitivity, may be beneficial or harmful. The feedback from the MVP workshops, the June 21, 2018 public meeting, and the September 25, 2018 regional stakeholder meeting have been incorporated into the findings in the Vulnerability Assessment in Appendix B. The findings are summarized below for each asset category by natural hazard, discussing the highest priority hazards first, then other hazard types. In addition, this section presents the results of a risk model used to evaluate vulnerability and also describes areas of Melrose that have been historically subject to multiple loss claims. 4.2 Priority Vulnerabilities in Melrose Flooding and severe weather have been identified as priority hazards in Melrose through the public input process outlined in Section 2. The City has faced these hazards in the past like other Massachusetts communities, including flooding from the Mother’s Day storm in 2006, overwhelming snowfall totals during the winter of 2015, and most recently impacts from the nor’easter events in January and March 2018. During the second of three March 2018 storms, Melrose City Hall lost power, which disabled the phone lines to emergency responders. These are examples of specific vulnerabilities that have already been caused by flooding and severe weather in Melrose. 1 Source: World Bank: https://climatescreeningtools.worldbank.org/content/key‐terms‐0 4‐1",
        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment The vulnerabilities these natural hazards cause to society, infrastructure, and the environment are summarized below; in many cases, the impacts are similar for fires and earthquakes as noted. The full details may be found in the Vulnerability Assessment in Appendix B. 4.2.1 Societal Vulnerability due to Flooding and Severe Weather The following is a summary of the societal asset vulnerabilities in Melrose due to flooding and severe weather:  Emergency Management Planning: The City of Melrose maintains emergency response and evacuation plans that emergency response personnel follow in the event of a natural disaster. Outdated emergency and evacuation plans that do not take into account increased frequency and intensity of climate change related natural disasters pose a risk to public health and safety.  Senior / Aging Population: The senior/aging populations may have impaired mobility, diminished sensory awareness, chronic illness, and/or other social and economic limitations that make them particularly vulnerable to natural hazards. Power outages resulting from flood, severe weather, or earthquake events could cause inadequate indoor heating or air conditioning (A/C) as well as potential loss of important medical technologies and life‐support equipment. Loss of communication with public safety personnel during emergency events also presents immediate danger to the senior/aging population, whether they are in their own homes or in senior housing. Maintaining power and communication with emergency personnel, as well as providing access to emergency relief resources such as food, water, medical supplies, and transportation to nearby shelters or hospitals are important components of keeping senior populations safe during an emergency.  Chronically Ill / Disabled Population: Chronically ill and disabled populations are particularly vulnerable to flooding and severe weather events as limited mobility, diminished sensory awareness, and/or reliance on medical equipment hinders their ability to seek shelter and stay safe during a natural disaster. This would include, but not be limited to, the mentally ill, pregnant women, and the physically disabled. Power outages resulting from natural disasters could cause inadequate indoor heating or A/C as well as the potential loss of important medical technologies and life‐support equipment.  Non‐English Speaking Population: The inability to communicate or understand relevant emergency response or health and safety information puts the non‐English speaking population at greater risk of life threatening circumstances during a natural hazard event.  Low‐Income Population: Low‐income populations in Melrose face additional challenges in the event of a natural disaster. Low‐income housing is generally less able to withstand disaster and may incur more damage than standard, newer homes, particularly during flood, severe weather, or earthquake events. Lower‐income populations may also lack access to personal transportation and communications and may not have adequate access to healthcare. In addition, low‐income populations may be less able to purchase and replace damaged goods and property and resupply food. In addition to the details outlined 4‐2",
        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment in Section 4.2.1, during extreme temperature events, low‐income populations may be unable to afford the cost of heating or cooling their homes.  Faith Based Organizations: Faith based organizations play an important societal role in Melrose, including in the event of a natural disaster. They have the potential to provide shelter and a safe refuge away from the chaos and destruction of natural hazard events. Due to the important role faith based organizations play in post‐disaster relief, ensuring accessibility and maintaining power and communication at such facilities is very important.  Pet Owners: During an emergency that requires evacuation from one's home, pet owners may be reluctant to leave if they cannot take their pets with them. Many shelters cannot accommodate pets and kennel capacity may be limited (or impacted by the same event that requires evacuation). People's reluctance to leave their pets may increase their vulnerability to acute events. 4.2.2 Infrastructure Vulnerability due to Flooding and Severe Weather The following is a summary of the infrastructure asset vulnerabilities in Melrose due to flooding and severe weather:  Transportation Infrastructure: Natural disasters such as floods, severe weather events, and earthquakes make transportation services and public transit systems vulnerable to damages and potential service delays or shut downs. Transportation infrastructure, including public transit systems, play an important role in pre and post disaster mitigation by providing evacuation route services to vulnerable populations before a disaster hits, by distributing emergency relief resources (food, supplies, medical personnel), and by safely mobilizing vulnerable populations to local shelters or hospitals post disaster. Roadways and parking lots throughout the City of Melrose are primarily vulnerable to flood or snow related road closures that would present emergency response and accessibility issues. Blocked roadways that prevent access to evacuation routes or that block routes to hospitals, utility infrastructure, and emergency response facilities are of greatest concern. Roadways and parking lots that are particularly vulnerable to flooding include Lebanon St at Sylvan St, Derby Road, the rail bridge at Melrose St., the City Hall parking lot, Grove St, and Geneva Road at Upham Street.  Residential and Commercial Properties: Residential and commercial properties throughout the City of Melrose are vulnerable to severe weather, floods, fire, and earthquake events. Properties that fall within flood prone areas are particularly vulnerable.  Fire and Police Stations: The fire and police stations in Melrose currently have a lack of back‐up power. Engines 2 and 3 do not have generators leaving these critical facilities vulnerable to power outages and communication losses during a severe storm, flood, or earthquake event. Police officers and firefighters offer important first response and rescue operations during an emergency. Power outages and loss of communication with such personnel could inhibit appropriate and timely response to those in need during a natural hazard event. 4‐3",
        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment  City Hall: Melrose City Hall serves as the hub for the City’s communications systems and has historically been home to the City’s Emergency Management Command Center. The server room in the Information Technology Department at City Hall contains equipment that runs the City’s phone systems for the Police and Fire Departments, along with the phones in City Hall and at most of the Melrose Public School buildings. Loss of communication with public safety personnel during emergency events presents immediate danger to public safety. Maintaining power at City Hall is of critical importance; it currently is particularly vulnerable due to the potential for power outages during flooding and severe weather events.  Emergency Shelters: Melrose Middle School and Memorial Hall serve as the City of Melrose's designated emergency shelter locations. Both buildings are particularly vulnerable to severe weather (especially extreme heat) and flood. Melrose Middle School is located in a flood prone area, and both emergency shelter locations are in urban areas that experience elevated surface temperatures. Access to adequate emergency relief supplies as well as controlled indoor temperatures and working communication systems at emergency shelters are critically important to public health and safety. Increased temperatures make access to adequate A/C at these shelter locations important.  Schools / Child Care Facilities: Schools and child care facilities are vulnerable to impacts associated with flooding, severe weather, earthquakes, or fire. Melrose High School and Melrose Middle School are at greater risk due to their being within the Ell Pond floodplain. Additionally, several schools including Melrose Middle School, Melrose High School, Lincoln Elementary School, Beebe School, and the Melrose Early Childhood Center are located in areas where elevated surface temperatures occur due to the heat island effect making access to adequate A/C more important. Maintaining communication with emergency personnel during a natural disaster is of critical importance for schools and child care facilities. In addition, Melrose schools are part of METCO, which allows children from Boston to attend Melrose Public Schools. Therefore, a disruption to the schools impacts children both in Melrose and regionally.  Melrose‐Wakefield Hospital: The Melrose‐Wakefield Hospital (MWH) is the only hospital facility in the City of Melrose. Centrally located, the hospital may be vulnerable to impacts from floods, severe weather, fire, and earthquakes. Power loss is the greatest risk to MWH associated with these natural hazards. Flooded roadways throughout the City and region have the potential to block transportation routes to the hospital as well.  Pharmacies: The availability of life saving medications and prescription drugs for vulnerable populations becomes of critical importance during a natural hazard event. In extreme circumstances, a severe storm, flood, fire, or earthquake could prevent the import of important medications to the local pharmacies in Melrose.  Gas Infrastructure: Gas transmission systems are primarily vulnerable to floods, severe weather and earthquake events. Significant flooding in areas with underground gas lines may lead to gas transmission system failures due to increased hydrostatic pressure. Erosion from severe storms or flood events may even expose buried gas lines leaving them vulnerable to damages from flowing debris and disruption of supporting materials. 4‐4",
        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment  Electrical / Power Infrastructure: Power lines and electrical substations are particularly vulnerable to floods, severe weather, earthquakes, and fire. High wind from severe storms and ground movement from earthquakes could cause downed power lines while extreme heat or drought conditions increase the likelihood of wildfires that may impact power lines or electrical substations. Electrical services for Melrose are provided by National Grid.  Fuel Sources: Preparation for and mitigation of natural disasters are largely dependent on access to sufficient fuel sources, such as gasoline and diesel. Public preparedness for natural hazards such as severe storms and floods includes the acquisition and storage of propane, gasoline, or diesel for transportation vehicles in case there are long‐term power outages.  Food Sources: Preparation and mitigation of natural disasters are largely dependent on access to sufficient food sources. This would include grocery stores, community gardens, or partnerships with regional farms. Public preparedness for natural hazards such as severe storms and floods includes the acquisition and storage of non‐perishable food and water in case there are long‐term power outages.  Communications Infrastructure: Properly working communication and information technology systems are of fundamental importance during an emergency event. Failure of these systems during a flood, severe weather event, or earthquake presents an immediate threat to public safety. Melrose relies on the City of Melrose IT Department, as well as Verizon and Comcast, to maintain communication pathways and IT systems during a natural hazard event.  Sewer Pumping Stations: Sewer pumping stations are facilities that pump wastewater from low lying areas to higher elevations and eventually to the wastewater treatment plant where the water is treated before being discharged back into the environment. The five sewer pumping stations in the City of Melrose are at risk of power loss during flooding, severe weather, or earthquake events. Lift stations on Union Street by the middle school and high school and on the Lynn Fells Parkway in a residential area, are located in or near a 1% annual chance flood prone area and are at greater risk of failure due to flooding. The consequences of failure at the two larger lift stations (on the Lynn Fells Parkway and Upham Street) are of particular concern. Power loss and flooding of sewer pumping stations could cause significant sewer system outages and lead to sewer line backups and spills in localized areas that could pose a potential health and safety hazard to the public and the environment. The cost of cleanup and repair of sewer system pumping stations could be substantial.  Water Pumping Stations: Melrose has two water booster stations to serve the “high service” neighborhoods. Both stations are in the good repair and have emergency back‐up pumps in the event of failure of the main pumps or a need for additional pressure during a fire or other high water use event. These stations are critical facilities to fight fires in the high service neighborhoods.  Water and Sewer Pipelines: Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) provides drinking water and sanitary sewer services for the City of Melrose; water and sewer 4‐5",
        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment pipelines are owned and maintained by both the MWRA (transmission lines and interceptors) and the City (local water and sewer mains). Loss of clean drinking water and functioning sewer systems presents a significant danger to public health and the environment. Areas at greater risk of failure during a severe storm or flooding event include sanitary sewer overflows off Melrose Street next to Melrose High School, as well as off Grove Street, Tremont Street, Sylvan Street, and Melrose Towers.  Stormwater Drainage Infrastructure: Stormwater drainage issues have the potential to cause significant flooding and damage to impacted areas. Debris from a storm event could clog storm drains and cause water to back‐up with no place to drain. Furthermore, downstream drainage channels, both covered and open channels, must be kept clean in order to pass the large volumes of water resulting during storm events. Areas of concern include Geneva Road at Upham Street as well as the outfall and related upstream piping at Wyoming Cemetery. 4.2.3 Environmental Vulnerability due to Flooding and Severe Weather The following is a summary of the environmental asset vulnerability in Melrose due to flooding and severe weather; note that air quality is only impacted by severe weather (extreme hot temperatures) and not by flooding:  Water Bodies: Lakes/Rivers/Reservoirs: Water‐bodies such as lakes, rivers, and reservoirs act as mechanisms of storm flow transmission and storage during flood or severe weather events. Drainage systems and flood management measures are designed to convey stormwater runoff to area waterways or floodplains. These measures help to minimize the potential for flooding in more populated areas that could cause significant structural damage or pose a risk to public safety. However, due to the stress imposed on water bodies from rapid flow increases or physical forces in the event of a severe storm, flood, or earthquake, erosion, landslides, and dam failures could be potential consequences. Drainage issues may result in the blockage and back‐up of stormwater flows that may ultimately impact nearby communities or structures. Specific areas of concern in Melrose include areas around Ell Pond, the DCR property at the downstream end of Ell Pond Brook, outlet structures at Swains Pond, and the connection between Towners Pond and Swains Pond. Additionally, if either the High Service Reservoir Earthen Dam or the Spot Pond Dam in the Town of Stoneham were to fail, approximately 60 million gallons of water would rush into the City of Melrose. Finally, extreme temperatures may adversely impact the natural habitat of native aquatic organisms.  Parks/Natural Areas/Open Space: Potential damages to parks and natural areas incurred from floods and severe storms could include downed trees, destroyed natural habitat, and diminished aesthetics. Extreme heat and periods of extended drought may also leave parks and natural areas more susceptible to fire and may adversely affect plant life. Invasive species also present a threat to native vegetation and wildlife. The primary parks in the City of Melrose include Melrose Common, Pine Banks Park, Conant Park, the Middlesex Fells Reservation, and the Mount Hood Golf Course. In addition, there are many acres of conservation land, with smaller neighborhood areas in the northern half of the City and 4‐6",
        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment more widespread conservation land in the southern half. Lastly, the City‐owned Wyoming Cemetery is a significant open space asset in the community.  Tree Canopy: Tree canopy is a measure of how much of the land surface is covered by tree leaves. Tree canopy is an important component of both urban and natural areas that provide shade, habitat, and aesthetic quality. Increased tree canopy also provides proven human health benefits such as improved cardiovascular, respiratory, and mental health. The tree canopy is vulnerable to all types of natural hazards ‐ severe storms, floods, fires, and earthquakes ‐ which may result in damaged and downed trees. Increasing the tree canopy also helps mitigate extreme heat impacts on natural habitats and reduces the heat island effect in urban areas.  Wildlife: Damage to parks and natural areas from floods, severe weather, earthquakes, or fires, could harm or displace native wildlife populations. Changes in wildlife populations could cause shifts in ecosystem structure and diminish biodiversity.  Air Quality: Temperature increases result in poor air quality which can impact public health and safety. On hot days, the level of air pollutants increases, making it difficult for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with respiratory illnesses to spend time outdoors. 4.3 Additional Vulnerabilities in Melrose As discussed in previous sections, fire, earthquake, and invasive species have varying degrees of likelihood of occurrence and impact in Melrose, however are included in this plan for completeness. Many of the vulnerabilities caused by these natural hazards are similar or the same as for flooding and severe weather. The impacts of these natural hazards on infrastructure, society, and the environment are summarized below. The full details may be found in the Vulnerability Assessment in Appendix B. 4.3.1 Vulnerability due to Fire A unique society vulnerability for fire relates to the Senior / Aging and Chronically Ill / Disabled populations in Melrose. They are particularly vulnerable to fire as limited mobility, diminished sensory awareness, and/or reliance on medical equipment hinders their ability to evacuate and stay safe during a natural disaster. Societal vulnerabilities for Emergency Management Planning, Non‐English Speaking Population, Low‐Income Population, Faith Based Organizations, and Pet Owners are the same as outlined in Section 4.2.1. Fire and Police Stations in Melrose have a unique infrastructure vulnerability in addition to the details outlined in Section 4.2.2; if these facilities are impacted by fire, it impacts the ability for emergency personnel in Melrose to respond to people's needs during fire events in the City. Infrastructure vulnerabilities for Residential and Commercial Properties, City Hall, Emergency Shelters, Schools/Child Care Facilities, Melrose‐Wakefield Hospital, Pharmacies, Fuel Sources, and Communications Infrastructure are the same as outlined in Section 4.2.2. 4‐7",
        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment For environmental vulnerabilities, Air Quality is adversely impacted by wildfire, which may be exacerbated due to extreme heat and drought conditions, in addition to the details outlined in Section 4.2.3. Environmental vulnerabilities for Parks/Natural Areas/Open Space, Tree Canopy, and Wildlife are the same as outlined in Section 4.2.3, with the added concerns of destruction of natural resources and the associated lengthy recovery due to fires. 4.3.2 Vulnerability due to Earthquake As with the societal vulnerabilities to fire, unique vulnerabilities for earthquakes relate to the Senior/Aging and Chronically Ill/Disabled populations in Melrose. They are particularly vulnerable due to limited mobility, diminished sensory awareness, and/or reliance on medical equipment that hinders their ability to evacuate and stay safe during a natural disaster. Societal vulnerabilities for Emergency Management Planning, Non‐English Speaking Population, Low‐Income Population, Faith Based Organizations, and Pet Owners are the same as outlined in Section 4.2.1. Earthquakes have the potential to cause wide‐scale Gas Infrastructure and Electrical/Power Infrastructure failure in addition to the details outlined in Section 4.2.2. Infrastructure vulnerabilities to earthquakes for Transportation Infrastructure, Residential and Commercial Properties, City Hall, Emergency Shelters, Schools/Child Care Facilities, Melrose‐Wakefield Hospital, Pharmacies, Fuel Sources, Communications Infrastructure, Sewer Pumping Stations, and Water and Sewer Pipelines are the same as outlined in Section 4.2.2. Environmental vulnerabilities to earthquakes for Water Bodies: Lakes/Rivers/Reservoirs, Tree Canopy, and Wildlife are the similar to those outlined in Section 4.2.3. 4.3.3 Vulnerability due to Invasive Species The following is a summary of the societal, infrastructure, and environmental vulnerabilities in Melrose due to invasive species:  Senior/Aging Population: The senior/aging populations are particularly susceptible to vector borne diseases making mosquito control an important preparation and mitigation measure as new and different species of mosquitos carrying disease migrate to the region. The Milano Senior Center and non‐profit organizations like Mystic Valley Elder Services are the primary entities that house and assist at risk senior populations in Melrose.  Food Sources: Some invasive species may impact locally grown produce at community and home gardens or regional farms.  Water Bodies: Lakes/Rivers/Reservoirs: The occurrence of invasive species and extreme temperatures may adversely impact the natural habitat of native aquatic organisms. Invasive plants, aquatic species, and animals could outcompete native organisms for food and/or shelter resulting in potential shifts in ecosystem structure and diminished biodiversity. Invasive insects such as some mosquito species may potentially spread disease. The ecosystems of the City’s ponds, including Ell Pond, Swains Pond, Towners Pond, and the ponds at the Mount Hood Golf Course would be of particular concern. 4‐8",
        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment  Parks/Natural Areas/Open Space: Invasive species also present a threat to native vegetation and wildlife. Invasive plants and animals could outcompete native organisms for food and/or shelter resulting in potential shifts in ecosystem structure and diminished biodiversity. Invasive insects such as some mosquito species may potentially spread disease.  Tree Canopy: As described above, the tree canopy is important in Melrose as it provides shade, habitat, aesthetic quality, and improved air quality and human health. Invasive species could potentially impact the health and density of native tree species.  Wildlife: Damage to parks and natural areas from invasive species could harm or displace native wildlife populations. Changes in wildlife populations could cause shifts in ecosystem structure and diminish biodiversity. 4.4 Impacts due to Disease Disease is a secondary effect resulting from other natural hazards discussed in this plan and is not considered a natural hazard itself. However, because the interplay between natural hazards and disease was an area of concern at the MVP workshops and during the June 21, 2018 public meeting and has impacts on the people that live and work in Melrose, it is summarized below. 4.4.1 Flooding and Disease Flood waters can transport harmful and hazardous materials that have the potential to cause human health issues. Specifically, floods in urban areas may be contaminated with high levels of harmful pathogens or chemical compounds originating from sewer overflows or nearby wastewater or industrial facilities. Exposure to such contaminants could cause short term gastrointestinal illness or other health concerns. Standing water and moist conditions following a flood event also have the potential to attract disease bearing insects like mosquitos. Mosquitos are vectors for the spread of diseases like H1N1, Zika, and other infectious diseases. 4.4.2 Extreme Temperatures and Disease Extreme heat has the potential to cause heat stress related illnesses including heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke. Workers exposed to extreme heat are at the greatest risk for heat related illness, as well as other high‐risk groups like the elderly or young children. Additionally, high heat conditions adversely impact air quality by increasing ground‐level ozone, or “smog” levels. Hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide pollution from things like vehicles and power plants combine with sunlight and heat resulting in elevated levels of air pollution on hot, sunny days. High smog levels can impact the elderly, infants, or individuals with existing respiratory illnesses like asthma and limit the amount of time they can safely stay outdoors. Additionally, changes in atmospheric conditions may favor the proliferation of particular disease‐causing pathogens or, as noted above, vectors which carry these pathogens. The potential to develop a cold stress related illness like frostbite is measured based on wind chill temperatures using the Wind Chill Temperature Index, which is shown in Table 4‐1. 4‐9",

Firefighters and first responders would also be at a greater risk when on the site of a fire. Smoke from wildfires contains emissions that include soot, tar, water vapor, minerals, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, formaldehyde, and benzene – all of which can have harmful health impacts if inhaled. 4.4.4 Other Disease Vulnerabilities Another disease risk from natural hazards is in the aftermath of a major natural disaster, when populations may not have access to clean, safe drinking water, proper nourishment, and hygienic living conditions. All types of natural hazards that may result in the need for emergency shelter use or that may impact the continued provision basic infrastructure services must be considered in relation to their potential to result in the spread of disease, especially to more vulnerable populations. Access to healthcare facilities, personnel, and medications may also be impeded during and after a major hazard event. 2 NWS Wind Chill/Temperature Index.

        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment 4.5 Loss Estimates Part of the vulnerability assessment presented herein is evaluating the potential monetary losses that may result from natural hazards. Identifying and understanding the potential losses allow Melrose to further evaluate and prioritize where hazard mitigation projects may be of most use. For this plan, the losses were evaluated for flooding, hurricanes (wind damage), and earthquakes using a HAZUS model, as well as reviewing historical multiple loss properties in Melrose due to flooding. 4.5.1 HAZUS Methodology, Data Inputs, Assumptions, and Results Hazards United States (HAZUS) is a natural hazard analysis tool developed by FEMA and the National Institute of Building Science (NIBS). The software package uses geographic information system (GIS) technology to calculate loss estimates and risk assessments. HAZUS estimates the cost of physical damage to buildings and contents due to floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis. High‐risk locations due to these natural hazards are identified and geographically represented for users to visualize the spatial relationships between populations and other fixed geographic assets or resources. The results generated by HAZUS are used by federal, state, regional and local governments and private enterprises to help communities make informed resource expenditure decisions related to disaster mitigation and preparedness. There are two analysis scenarios in HAZUS for hazard events: 1) probabilistic analysis or 2) deterministic analysis. The probabilistic analysis estimates average annual losses based on the probability of multiple events occurring during specific time periods; this means the loss estimate can be higher or lower in a given year. It also evaluates the statistical likelihood that a given event will occur. Since this plan incorporates the effects of climate change ‐ which impact the probability of flooding and hurricane events ‐ it was determined that the probabilistic analysis did not fit the needs of the plan. Therefore, the deterministic analysis was used, which evaluates losses based on specific events and does not evaluate the frequency or probability of the event. It gives a worst‐case scenario of losses due to a natural hazard event. 4.5.1.1 HAZUS Flood Model The HAZUS Flood Model is an integrated system for identifying and quantifying flood risks based on the Multi‐Hazard Loss Estimation Methodology Flood Model. The HAZUS Flood Model methodology can be dissected into two processes: 1) the flood hazard analysis and 2) the flood loss estimation analysis. Frequency, discharge, and ground elevation are used to model the spatial variation in flood depth and velocity in the flood hazard analysis phase. In the loss estimation phases, vulnerability curves and the results of the flood hazard analysis are used to calculate structural and economic damage.3 HAZUS has two flood designations to choose from – coastal or riverine flood hazards. To estimate flood losses in Melrose, the riverine flood hazard designation was selected, which is used for non‐ coastal areas. Flood hazard is defined by the relationship between the depth of flooding and the 3 Multi‐hazard Loss Estimation Methodology Flood Model.

        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment annual chance of inundation to that depth.4 In addition to the hazard designation, flood magnitude was also specified as an input within the HAZUS Flood Model. The FEMA 100‐year and 500‐year floodplains5 were examined in this analysis, including use of the recently updated flood elevations for the Ell Pond watershed. A total of six sets of flood model results were compared using each of the following methods of calculating the flood elevations for both the 100‐year and 500‐year floods: 1) Default Data, 2) FEMA’s Effective Data, and 3) User Defined Facilities (UDF) with FEMA’s effective data. Each of these categories is described below: 1. Default Data: 100‐ and 500‐year floodplains are developed using elevation data and the default HAZUS flood model. HAZUS‐generated flooding extent and depth is compared to default inventory data to create a loss estimate. 2. FEMA Effective Data: FEMA effective 100‐ and 500‐year floodplains are compared to default inventory data to create a loss estimate. 3. User Defined Facilities: City‐supplied data replaces the default inventory. FEMA effective 100‐ and 500‐year floodplains are compared to local inventory data to create a loss estimate. Note that FEMA’s effective data for 500‐year flood zones are only captured in detailed study areas. In an actual 500‐year flood event, it is expected that the areas in the 100‐year flood zone would also experience losses. 4.5.1.2 HAZUS Hurricane Model The HAZUS Hurricane Model is used to estimate losses from hurricane winds and storm surge. For this plan, only wind effects from hurricanes were evaluated and not the potential storm surge flooding, given the distance from the coast. Inland flooding effects are captured in the flood module. The Hurricane Model uses a default terrain roughness founded on digitized Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data. Ground roughness is a critical component for the modeling of wind effects, damage, and losses to buildings.6 The rougher the ground surface becomes, the wind speeds near the ground decrease, while the upper level wind speeds remain the same. For example, a typical suburban or urban environment with trees experiences lower wind loads on structures than those experienced by buildings located in unobstructed regions such as waterfronts and open fields. HAZUS contains a database of historical hurricanes. For this plan, the 1938 New England Hurricane was modeled with the default census data (tracts) for the inventory. The 1938 hurricane can be considered a worst‐case scenario for the region (based on historical storms). It 4 HAZUS Flood Model User Guidance.

        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment became a Category 5 hurricane before making landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on Long Island; the hurricane weakened while traveling inland through Connecticut and Massachusetts, and was still a Category 1 storm entering Vermont. While the storm center traveled roughly along the Connecticut River, about 80 miles west of Melrose, the damages within the city modeled with HAZUS were significant. 4.5.1.3 HAZUS Earthquake Model As with the HAZUS Hurricane Model, the HAZUS Earthquake Model is a tool within HAZUS that generates results based on a database of historical earthquakes, which can be used to show the projected impact of a similar earthquake today. The 1755 earthquake was selected as the input scenario for this plan. Its epicenter was approximately 25 miles east‐north‐east of Cape Ann, MA, and it was an estimated 5.9 magnitude earthquake. Note that a limitation of the Earthquake Model is that the methodology does not have the capacity to calculate the additional damage or loss due to flooding or fire that could potentially occur as a result of an earthquake.7 4.5.1.4 HAZUS Results The HAZUS results show the total loss by census block for flooding and by census tract for hurricane and earthquake. Census blocks are the smallest entity for which the U.S. Census Bureau collects information. Typically, a census block is the equivalent of a city block bounded by streets on all sides. Block groups are made up of an average of 40 census blocks and typically contain between 600 and 3,000 people. Census tracts generally contain 1,500 to 8,000 people and are made up of on average four block groups. The total losses for each of the six flooding scenarios show that the values are decreasing with each additional level of detail (i.e., the Default Data predicts the highest losses while the UDF predicts the lowest). The 100‐year and 500‐year UDF scenarios are showing the lowest total losses, likely because the analysis is only pulling parcels that intersect the floodplain, whereas the other flooding scenarios aggregated the default census data at the block level, which likely over estimates losses. These results are shown in Figures 4‐1 to 4‐6. Table 4‐2 distinguishes between 500‐year total losses and additional 100‐year losses because the FEMA 500‐year flood zones are only captured in detailed study areas. In an actual 500‐year flood event, it is expected that the areas in the 100‐year flood zone would also experience losses. Hurricane and earthquake results can also be found in Table 4‐2, Figure 4‐7, and Figure 4‐8. 7 Multi‐hazard Loss Estimation Methodology Earthquake Model.

        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment 4.5.2 Value of Frequently Flooded Areas Prior to the MVP workshops, the City identified areas of concern due to potential hazards, including flooding. These areas are outside of the 100‐year and 500‐year floodplains, which indicates the flooding is likely due to stormwater drainage challenges. These areas are expected to continue to experience flooding if no hazard mitigation action is taken, especially with the expected changes in precipitation extremes due to climate change. To estimate the approximate extent of flooding, elevation data and GIS hydrology tools were used to model corresponding flooding at these drainage issue areas. Each issue point was analyzed by intersecting parcels with the cloudburst depth grid8 and calculating the total building assessed value for all parcels. These assessed building values do not accurately represent the damage from a flooding event but provide some insight to what may be damaged. Note that the Wyoming Cemetery outfall (4), Swain’s Pond outlet (5), and connection between Towners Pond and Swain’s Pond (6) do not have estimated building values because there are not any buildings within those parcels, or the parcel Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) database did not contain prior year building assessed value. However, the flooding at Lebanon Street and Sylvan Street (7) is directly caused by issues at the Wyoming Cemetery outfall. Table 4‐3 summarizes these thirteen frequently flooded areas and Figure 4‐9 provides a visualization of this analysis.

        "Section 4  Vulnerability Assessment 4.5.3 Repetitive Loss Properties A Repetitive Loss Property is any insurable building for which two or more claims of more than $1,000 were paid by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) within a 10‐year period since 1978. Severe Repetitive Loss Properties are residential properties with four or more NFIP claim payments of more than $5,000 each, with at least two of those payments occurring in a 10‐year period, and with the total claims paid exceeding $20,000, or two or more claim payments that cumulatively exceeded the building’s value. FEMA reports that a total of 11 properties in Melrose are considered Repetitive Loss Properties, one of which is also a Severe Repetitive Loss Property. Details regarding these properties such as the exact addresses, number of losses per addresses, and claim amount per address are privileged and confidential information to protect the privacy of the owners. Reviewing this information in terms of the areas where these repetitive losses have occurred, as opposed to exact location, helps to inform the community of the areas where hazard mitigation assistance may be most warranted to prevent losses in the future, recognizing that additional properties may have also experienced repetitive losses, but did not necessarily have a flood insurance policy through the NFIP. Table 4‐4 and Figure 4‐10 present a high‐level summary of the total number of claims and amounts paid by drainage area to demonstrate the areas within Melrose that are impacted by repetitive losses.

        "Section 5 Updated Hazard Areas from 2004 NHMP 5.1 High Hazard Area Profiles During the development of the 2004 NHMP, the community team established geographic areas of the City as having the highest risk to natural hazards. These areas have been reviewed and reevaluated as part of this process; areas that continue to be of concern in Melrose are listed below. Although these hazard areas are also susceptible to high winds and other natural hazards, the flooding in these areas has been determined to be the primary cause of risk to the community. In many of these areas, opportunities exist to modify or upgrade the City’s stormwater collection and transport systems to minimize current flooding problems. A description of each high flood hazard area is presented in the following sections along with some potential causes and mitigation measures. Each of these frequent flooding areas requires a more detailed engineering evaluation, beyond the scope of this study, to responsibly evaluate the cause and potential alternatives essential for more thorough mitigation recommendations. Figure 5‐1 shows the flood hazard regions which includes the one percent and 0.2 percent chance annual flood hazard areas and areas in Melrose prone to flooding. It also locates and identifies critical facilities in Melrose, including:  Police and fire stations  Emergency shelters and emergency generators  City Hall and the historic district  Water and wastewater pumping stations  The Melrose‐Wakefield hospital  Schools and libraries  Affordable housing  Long term care facilities Each flood hazard area is described in detail below. 5‐1",

        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions 5.1.1 Ell Pond Flood Hazard Region When the 2004 analysis was performed, a large area around Ell Pond experienced significant flooding roughly every other year. There were also smaller portions of this area that experienced shallow flooding during a 100‐year and 500‐year flood in accordance with FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps. In general, a rainstorm with 3 to 4 inches of total rainfall used to result in significant flooding around Ell Pond. Ell Pond receives flow from a large total drainage area including areas located adjacent to Ell Pond and flows from streams and culverts transporting flow from both Stoneham and Wakefield. Flow discharges from Ell Pond through an outlet located at the southeast corner of the Pond. Following the 2004 NHMP, the City, with assistance from FEMA, installed a new outlet from Ell Pond along with a crest gate that added flexibility in the ability to manipulate the pond’s surface elevation. Both the new Ell Pond Drain and the prior discharge outlet transport water southward within or adjacent to Main Street. These flows eventually discharge near the Wyoming Hill commuter rail station to an open channel known as Lower Spot Pond Brook. The flows continue southward within Lower Spot Pond Brook through Malden and eventually reach a location upstream of the Amelia Earhart Dam located on the Mystic River in Boston. As the issues surrounding Ell Pond were the most significant natural hazard within the City, solutions were immediately sought and implemented after completion of the 2004 report. While the solutions implemented have been very successful, large rain events with increasing volumes and intensities can still cause some degree of flooding in the vicinity of Ell Pond, as shown by the newly adopted floodplain elevations shown on Figure 5‐1. Therefore, this area was maintained in this report as a focus area for monitoring potential future flooding impacts. 5.1.1.1 The Towers and Other Ell Pond Area Properties Prior to the improvements described above to the Ell Pond outlet, the Towers, a residential high‐ rise located northeast of Ell Pond, experienced shallow flooding in the lower level parking area approximately every six months. Deeper flood waters totaling several feet in depth were also experienced within the parking garage about every other year. Other structures located in this flood hazard area include the Melrose High School and Melrose Veteran’s Memorial Middle School campus, businesses, the Elmhurst Nursing Home, the Melrose DPW City Yard, and residential houses. While flooding in these areas has substantially improved as a result of the new Ell Pond outlet and crest gate installation, some issues still exist during large storms. One issue of note is wastewater backups that sometimes impact homes on Melrose Street when infiltration and inflow into the City’s sewer system cause capacity restrictions within the City’s sewer mains that run beneath the school campus. This issue relates to both the intensity of storm events and deficiencies in the City’s sewer infrastructure. 5.1.1.2 Roosevelt School Athletic Fields When the 2004 NHMP was developed, the athletic fields located behind the Roosevelt Elementary School on Vinton Street experienced flooding about four times per year. Since that time, the detention basin at the school has been improved, which has minimized flooding. These improvements have largely mitigated the associated flooding issues; however, their success is predicated on keeping the stormwater grate adjacent to the school clear of debris. Furthermore, improvements are recommended to the City’s drainage system where it runs from Vinton Street, 5‐3",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions beneath the railroad tracks, through the property of a current auto body shop, discharging to Tremont Street (referred to herein as the “Tremont Street Drain”). This drainage pipe creates a bottleneck that sometimes results in backups onto the Roosevelt School property. The City should prioritize keeping the drainage grate clear and ensuring that it is accessible for periodic cleaning throughout the year. In addition, the Tremont Street Drain should be further evaluated to determine if improvements are feasible. 5.1.1.3 Melrose Street This small, community defined flood area is limited to the area beneath the Boston and Maine Railroad “overpass” bridge that crosses Melrose Street. The cause of this flooding may be due to a combination of the low lying ground surface in this area and the flooding in the Ell Pond area. As explained previously, flooding in this neighborhood creates surcharge conditions in the subsurface culvert passing through the Roosevelt School property. The drainage system in the Melrose Street area discharges to the same culvert at a location adjacent to the Boston and Maine Railroad. Previously, sewer backups within the MWRA transmission mains in this vicinity were also an issue during storm events. In response to this issue, the MWRA constructed a second transmission main in this area. As a mitigation measure to minimize capacity restrictions, the MWRA brings a bypass pump to Melrose Street when large storms are expected and pumps flow from one main into the other to equalize flows and minimize the risk of sewer overflows or backups. 5.1.2 Downtown Flood Hazard Region The City of Melrose downtown district is located just south of Ell Pond. In 2004, three flood hazard areas were identified in this region: Felton Place, the Synagogue area, and the City Hall parking lot. The improvements to the Ell Pond outlet have resolved the flooding issues at the first two sites, having relieved the older granite Ell Pond outlet culvert of its capacity restrictions by providing a parallel outlet drain. The City Hall parking lot continues to be an area of concern. 5.1.2.1 City Hall Parking Lot The parking lot behind City Hall experiences flooding about four times per year. The catch basins and storm drainage that collect the storm water runoff from the parking lot discharges to the Ell Pond effluent culvert at a location near Felton Place. It is possible that surcharged water levels in the granite culvert near Felton Place cause the City Hall parking lot to surcharge above the elevation of the parking lot. However, with the other related flood areas having been alleviated by the installation of the new Ell Pond outlet, the problems causing the parking lot to flood may be more localized. It has been reported that the storm drains in the parking lot are pitched backwards, potentially exacerbating the flood problem. Typical flooding in this area is shallow and limited to the parking lot area. However, it is sometimes significant enough that cars need to be relocated to avoid damage. The 2004 Community Team reported that one flood reached the roof level of cars parked in the lot, although this was prior to the Ell Pond outlet improvements. 5‐4",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions The Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall is a critical facility located adjacent to the City Hall Parking lot that has been affected at times by the flooding in this area. 5.1.3 Lower Spot Pond Brook Flood Hazard Region As explained previously, discharge from Ell Pond eventually flows to a large earthen open channel known as Lower Spot Pond Brook, running parallel to the Boston & Maine Railroad tracks on the southern end of Melrose. The 2004 Community Team identified a relationship between the operation of the Amelia Earhart dam/pump station (located miles downstream in Boston) and the water level in the Lower Spot Pond Brook. It is believed that the operation of the dam includes free discharge of flow into Boston Harbor when the Harbor level is within non‐storm surge conditions. The combination of damming and pumping of the flow to Boston Harbor occurs when the Harbor levels become surcharged during storm surge conditions. It is believed that the upstream water level of the dam during pumping creates a downstream water level that results in surcharge several miles upstream within the Lower Spot Pond Brook. This surcharge is believed to be to an elevation that impacts the capacity of the storm drainage systems located adjacent to the Brook resulting in flooding in each area. It is not known whether flow within the Brook backflows through any of the storm drainage systems to the flood areas. The Derby Road and Main Street/Sylvan Street hazard areas described below were identified by the 2004 Community Team as being at least partially the result of surcharge levels in Lower Spot Pond Brook. These areas have also been noted more recently as priority areas for keeping catch basins clean, to ensure unrestricted localized flow during storm events. A third area in this region, Converse Lane, had also been identified in 2004 as having flooding problems. Drainage improvements have since been made to the Converse Lane neighborhood to alleviate flooding, therefore it is no longer included herein. 5.1.3.1 Derby Road This older neighborhood located to the east of Lower Spot Pond Brook was reported in 2004 to experience flooding six to ten times per year. The storm drain system in this neighborhood discharges directly to Lower Spot Pond Brook. It is believed that as the Brook surcharges due to downstream conditions, the storm drainage system in the Derby Road area surcharges above the roadway level before the capacity required to transport the local runoff is achieved. This results in basement, yard, and street flooding. To respond to frequent complaints from residents, the Melrose Public Works Department continues to clean the storm drains and catch basins in this area two to three times per year. The continued flooding that occurs even after the cleaning has been performed indicates the flood problem is due to the hydraulic deficiencies of the storm drainage in this area. 5.1.3.2 Main Street/Sylvan Street Another 2004 Community Team defined flood hazard area is located directly south of the Derby Road flood hazard area. Basement, yard, and street flooding occur here almost every other month, especially at the intersection of Main Street and Sylvan Street. The Community Team believed the flooding in this area has similar origin to the Derby Road area in that the storm drainage system 5‐5",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions that discharges directly to Lower Spot Pond Brook has inadequate capacity when surcharge occurs in Lower Spot Pond Brook. 5.1.3.3 Boston Rock Road Small, local flooding was reported in 2004 to occur off of Boston Rock Road about four times per year. The flooding is limited to a handful of houses on Boston Rock Road and is a direct result of surcharge in the storm drain located within Boston Rock Road. It appears that this flood hazard area is caused by a combination of undersized drain piping and the low ground surface elevation within this area. 5.1.4 South Washington Street Flood Hazard Area This flood hazard area located between the Middlesex Fells Reservation to the west and Lower Spot Pond Brook to the east was reported in 2004 as experiencing flooding about three times per year. It is believed that the flooding is caused by a blockage of the inlet structure, commonly referred to as the “trash grate,” located at the boundary between Melrose and Malden. This inlet structure is within the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), and the flooding is due to inadequate frequency of cleaning of the structure. This grate is often blocked with debris that washes out from the wooded area adjacent to it during storm runoff conditions. The flooding typically requires the closing of one lane of traffic on South Washington Street and also floods adjacent parking lots. The City is continuing to work with the DCR to ensure that routine cleaning of the grate is performed. 5.1.5 Wyoming Cemetery Flood Hazard Region Several identified flood hazard areas are located along a route of culverts that transport storm water from the area adjacent to Wyoming Cemetery, through the Cemetery, to a brook located within Pine Banks Park, where it flows into Malden. The following three flood hazard areas have been identified within this region. 5.1.5.1 Pine Banks Park Pine Banks Park is a densely wooded area located in the southwestern corner of the City of Melrose. It is believed that this area experiences shallow flooding similar to the FEMA designation for this area: 100‐year and 500‐year shallow flooding (less than one foot of depth). Flooding is limited to a portion of the park that is designated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a wetland area. 5.1.5.2 Cemetery The flooding within Wyoming Cemetery is identified by FEMA to be within a 100‐year and 500‐ year shallow flood zone (less than one foot of depth). The 2004 Community Team indicated a flood frequency of about six times per year within this area. Flooding has also been observed and reported in recent years. The flooding is caused by deficiencies within the drainage pipes through the cemetery and the adjacent Pine Banks Park, as well as the downstream outfall. The pipes through the cemetery do not have adequate pitch, and the outfall frequently has sediment deposits that back up at the outlet and restrict flow. Although the flooding within the cemetery is frequent, it is shallow and has little resulting impact because there are no buildings within this 5‐6",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions area. The main significance of the Cemetery flood area is the impact this flooding has on the upstream Sylvan Street flood area described below. 5.1.5.3 Sylvan Street This flood hazard area is located adjacent to the northeast corner of Wyoming Cemetery and was reported in 2004 as flooding about six times per year. The storm drain system on Sylvan Street discharges through the Cemetery flood hazard area and typically floods during the same storm events as the Cemetery area. In the last two years, the City has performed extensive study of the pipes from this neighborhood, through the cemetery, to the outfall, and has identified a number of deficiencies. A preliminary plan for replacement/relocation of the drainage infrastructure downstream of this area has been developed for implementation when funding becomes available. This area is also susceptible to sewer backups during storms, when infiltration and inflow overwhelm the adjacent sewer mains. This problem has exacerbated the impacts to the adjacent homes when combined with the stormwater flooding noted above. 5.1.6 Long Pond Flood Hazard Region Long Pond receives storm water flow from a variety of neighborhoods located in the eastern area of Melrose. The following flood hazard areas have been identified: Long Pond, Bow Street/Sycamore Road, and Burnett Street Flood Hazard Areas. While flooding in these areas has improved as drainage system improvement projects have been implemented, this area is still susceptible to some level of flooding and is one the City continues to watch during storm events. 5.1.6.1 Long Pond Long Pond is located on the eastern border of Melrose and is partly located within the adjacent Town of Saugus. The pond acts as a detention basin for storm water runoff from a large area of eastern Melrose. The 2004 Community Team indicated that the area around the Pond flooded only once every few years with minimal resulting impact due to its location in undeveloped land. Long Pond is partly located within the Mount Hood Memorial Park and Golf Course. The Golf Course, although not specifically identified as a flood hazard area, was identified by the 2004 Community Team as an area that experiences flooding about once every two years. 5.1.6.2 Bow Street/Sycamore Road This residential neighborhood, located about ¼ of a mile east of Melrose Common, was reported as flooding about once per year in 2004. Catch basins located in low areas in the backyards of houses on Bow Street surcharge, resulting in significant yard and basement/structural flooding especially between Bow Street and Slayton Road. It is believed that flooding in this area is due to surcharge conditions in a subsurface culvert running between Bow Street and Slayton Street, possibly resulting from the downstream water level in the Long Pond area. Homes at the end of Laurel Street are also sometimes impacted by flooding in this area. Mitigation of this flooding is assisted by routine maintenance of the open 5‐7",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions channels downstream of the drainage in these neighborhoods, within the Mount Hood Golf Course. 5.1.6.3 Burnett Street The Burnett Street flood hazard area, located adjacent to the Bow Street area, was reported in 2004 to experience flooding about once a year, typically concurrent with flooding in the Bow Street area. The 2004 Community Team decided to distinguish this flood area separately from the adjacent Bow Street area because the extent and magnitude of the flooding in the Burnett area had been significantly mitigated prior to the 2004 NHMP, through a recently constructed detention pond located on the 1st hole of the Mount Hood Golf Course southeast of the Burnett Street area. The new storage within this basin appears to dampen out the peak flow of storm water runoff that the Golf Course previously contributed to the Burnett Street area. Since the basin was constructed, only small scale basement flooding in a few homes has occurred in this area about once per year. 5.1.7 Ashburton Place Flood Hazard Area The Steele House senior center and a residential area located in the northwest corner of the Melrose Highlands (in northern Melrose) was reported in 2004 to experience flooding about once every nine months. Flooding of basements, yards, and parking lots is common in this area and the Steele House, a critical facility, has required evacuation on at least one occasion. When flooding does occur, shallow water of 1 to 2 inches in depth appears within parking lots in this area. 5.2 Other Flood Hazard Area Profiles In order to address all of the known flood hazard areas affecting the City, this subsection presents additional flood hazard areas that were either established by the 2004 Community Team or were identified by FEMA as located within the 100‐year floodplain. Each of these delineated geographic areas has been determined to be at some level of risk for a future flood event; however, the level of risk to community assets is considered to be less than for those flood hazard areas presented above. 5.2.1 Bellevue Golf Club Flood Hazard Region The area surrounding the Bellevue Golf Club, in the northeastern portion of the Melrose Highlands, has been defined by FEMA as being within the 100‐year floodplain. This area has been divided into the Carlida Road area and the Bellevue Golf Club area. 5.2.1.1 Carlida Road This neighborhood located north of Howard Street and adjacent to the border with Saugus has experienced stormwater flooding in the past, however flooding has not occurred in recent years including during 100‐year storm events. Homeowners in this flood hazard area, mainly on Windsor Street, have petitioned FEMA with Letters of Amendment (LOA) to request a revised delineation of the 100‐year floodplain in this area. Many of the residents in this area believe that their homes are not within the true 100‐year floodplain, even though their property is located within the 100‐year flood zone as defined on the 5‐8",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions current version of the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps. These residents believe that they should not be required to carry flood insurance for their properties. 5.2.1.2 Bellevue Golf Club The Bellevue Golf Course was reported in 2004 as experiencing flooding about four times per year. However, the neighborhoods associated with this flood hazard area on Rivers Lane and Lynn Fells Parkway only experience flooding about once every four years. Flooding within the golf course is believed to be attributed to an undersized surface culvert that transports flow from Wakefield and the Melrose Highlands through the Golf Course to Saugus. The Fellsway Wastewater Pump Station is a critical facility within this flood area that could experience damage or become disabled during a significant flood event in this area. The station is also susceptible to high flows during storm events due to inflow into the sewer system, which could result in sewer backups or overflows. 5.2.2 Swains Pond Avenue Flood Hazard Region The Swains Pond Avenue region of Melrose, located just to the west of the Mount Hood Golf Course, is sparsely developed and covered with woodlands and ponds. The following flood hazard areas have been identified within this region and have each been identified as having minimal impact to the community. 5.2.2.1 Swains Pond & Towners Pond Swains Pond and Towners Pond experience noticeable flooding about once every ten years. Although there was no experience by the 2004 Community Team of this flooding causing impacts to any structures, yards or streets, the defined 100‐year floodplain does encroach on houses located on Swains Pond Avenue and the paved roadway in two locations. The 2004 Community Team indicated that no complaints had been received from property owners in this area. A headwall structure at the outlet from Swains Pond was damaged during a winter storm in 2015 and requires replacement in the near term. 5.2.3 Lincoln Street Flood Hazard Area The Lincoln Street area located adjacent to the Lynn Fells Parkway and west of the Bellevue Golf Club has been determined as a flood hazard area that, in 2004, was reported to experience flooding about once every six months. The flooding historically experienced here was limited to the roadways and was the most severe at a low lying area of Lincoln Street. Members of the 2004 Community Team believed that the flooding on Lincoln Street may be mitigated with the construction of a few new catch basins within the low lying area of the street. Since that time, substantial drainage improvements (replacement and rerouting) have taken place in the neighborhoods of Stowecroft Road and Burrell Street, in this general vicinity. These improvements have mitigated backyard flooding issues on these streets. This area will continue to be watched during storm events, but the improvements in this area are believed to have alleviated the majority of the flooding in this neighborhood. 5‐9",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions 5.2.4 Conant Park/Martin Street Flood Hazard Area This flood hazard area contains two distinct sub‐areas; a residential area around Martin Street indicated by FEMA to be within the region of shallow flooding (less than one foot deep) during 100 and 500‐year flood frequencies, and a flood prone sub‐area mainly within Conant Park as indicated by the 2004 Community Team. The recurrence of flooding of the baseball fields located in Conant Park is about once a year, and the Martin Street area rarely (if ever) experiences flooding. This is still the case at this time. The Melrose Care Center is a critical facility located on Martin Street within the FEMA designated shallow flood area. 5.2.5 Bay State Road Flood Hazard Area The Bay State Road Flood Hazard Area, located in the northeast corner of the Melrose Highlands and adjacent to the Wakefield border, was reported in 2004 to experience flooding about once every two years. The flooding is mainly limited to undeveloped land, much of which is designated as a wetland resource area. The extent of flooding decreased significantly prior to 2004 following construction of a new drain within Damon Avenue to transport a higher capacity of flow southward within the collection system. A headwall structure was also replaced, where only a pipe previously existed. It is believed that the basement, yard and street flooding on Bay State Road and Damon Avenue experienced in the past have been eliminated by these improvements, but this area is still watched by the City during storm events. 5.3 Update on Identified Actions in the 2004 Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan The 2004 Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan identified 16 priority measures to reduce the risks posed by natural hazards. The City has completed five of these actions, has partially completed or is currently working on ten, and did not act on one. The status of these actions is listed in Table 5‐ 1 below. For those not completed, the actions are further summarized with details on the current status and are carried into the later sections of this report. 5‐10",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions Table 5‐1. Summary of the Status of 2004 Priority Mitigation Actions Priority Mitigation Actions  Reconstruct DPW Maintenance and Repair Garage (City Yard): This facility, located within the 100‐year flood area of Ell Pond at 72 Tremont Street, stores diesel fuel for the Fire, Police, School, Emergency Management and Public Works departments. Also, other hazardous materials such as oil, gasoline, solvents, etc. are stored here for both vehicle maintenance and emergency repair. The garage was to be reconstructed in a way to protect the active use of the garage during flood events (in Ell Pond) while avoiding hazardous contamination due to stored chemicals. Status: Partial Completion Action Update: The improvements to the outlet from Ell Pond have substantially decreased the frequency and magnitude of flooding within the Ell Pond watershed. This is reflected in the updated base flood elevation that was approved by FEMA on December 3, 2018. In addition, significant renovations have been made at the City Yard facility since 2004, and improvements have been made with regard to materials storage and organization such that operations have not been impeded in recent years by storm events. Since this facility is still within the 100‐year floodplain to Ell Pond, opportunities for further improvements will continue to be sought as maintenance and upgrade projects are undertaken within the facility.  Reconstruct Roosevelt School Detention Basin: This facility serves as the last detention basin prior to discharge of stormwater through the northwest tributary culvert to Ell Pond. 5‐11 etelpmoC laitraP noitelpmoC ssergorP nI noitcA oN Reconstruct DPW Maintenance and Repair Garage X Reconstruct Middle School/High School Drain X Reconstruct Roosevelt School Detention Basin X Study/Implement Mitigation Measures for the Melrose Towers Condos X Petition FEMA – include Converse Lane Community in 100‐year floodplain X Converse Lane Drainage Improvements X Reconstruct Upstream Portion of Tremont Street Drain X Study and Implement Mitigation Measures for Several Flood Hazard Areas X Official City of Melrose Website – Increase Public Outreach X Incident Command Course (ICS) X Portable Generators X Secure Important Records X Direct‐Connect for City Departments X Reverse 911 X Enroll in the Community Rating System X South Washington Street Trash Grate X",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions Several issues were identified in 2004 including the time of concentration that were believed to adversely impact flooding in the Ell Pond area. Also, it was acknowledged that wastewater overflows entered the detention basin and were then transported to Ell Pond through the northwest tributary culvert. There were also concerns for the safety of elementary school students at the Roosevelt School while the basin was holding water. Status: Partial Completion Action Update: The detention basin reconstruction has been completed. This area remains a location that requires routine maintenance. The City will continue to clean the grate that enters the drain beneath the railroad tracks and keep it accessible for routine maintenance.  Reconstruct Upstream Portion of Tremont Street Drain: The deteriorating 30‐inch corrugated metal (CM) pipe requires cleaning and lining. This segment of pipe is located upstream from the portions of the drain previously cleaned and lined or replaced with new 30‐inch reinforced concrete pipe. Status: Partial Completion Action Update: The downstream portion of the Tremont Street drain was rehabilitated, and the upstream portion has been cleaned. Rehabilitation of the bottleneck between Tremont Street and Vinton Street is still recommended, although other improvements in the Ell Pond watershed have lessened the overall impacts of flooding in this area. This project remains on the list of projects for completion.  Study and Implement Mitigation Measures for Several Flood Hazard Areas: In 2004, the NHMP recommended developing and implementing mitigation measures for flooding in the following flood hazard areas:  Derby Road  Main Street/Sylvan Street  Boston Rock Road  Sylvan Street  Wyoming Cemetery  Lincoln Street Status: In Progress Action Update: Several of these areas have been improved through minor improvements to the drainage system, along with increased frequency of routine maintenance such as catch basin and drain line cleaning. The City intends to continue with high frequency routine maintenance in the areas identified as benefiting from such work. At this time, the Wyoming Cemetery area and the related upstream flood hazard areas have been identified 5‐12",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions as the highest priority for infrastructure replacement of the flooding areas identified within Sections 5.1 and 5.2 above.  Official City of Melrose Website: Increase public outreach on the website (www.cityofmelrose.org) with links to mitigation activities from this plan, FEMA 100‐year floodplain maps, geographic information systems (GIS) data, and other natural disaster‐ related links such as hurricane preparation. Status: In Progress Action Update: The City’s website has been improved with regard to the availability of information, including links to the documents produced during the MVP process that are available for public viewing. Information contained in this new NHMP report will be placed on the website along with other documents described above. A dedicated webpage will be created for the information related to this report and will be made public through the Mayor’s Blog or other online media channels.  Incident Command Course (ICS): Initiate this course through the Emergency Management Department to better prepare City personnel for emergency response. Status: In Progress Action Update: The FEMA Emergency Management Institute now has updated incident command and National Incident Management Systems (NIMS) training courses, which can be found at: https://training.fema.gov/nims/. The City will determine the most appropriate training opportunities for personnel to ensure training needs are being met. The City will ensure that the Emergency Management Director has adequate training and that other City personnel involved in emergency response are also trained as needed.  Portable Generators: Purchase three portable generators for use in the following locations: one for City Hall, one for the City Yard on Tremont Street, and one to be shared among the five water and wastewater pump stations in the City. Status: Partial Completion Action Update: The City now owns three portable generators, as described above. However, as detailed elsewhere in this report, the generators are not sufficient to provide the needed backup power in emergency situations. The highest priority is to install a permanent generator at City Hall. The water and sewer pumping stations also require at least one more portable generator, along with modifications to ensure the ability to run all stations using the same portable equipment.  Secure Important Records: Scan important records and documents stored in City Hall onto microfilm (or electronic form). Store the copy of the records at a secure off‐site location away from the original records located at City Hall. Status: In Progress 5‐13",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions Action Update: Since 2004, the City has had some sets of documents scanned, such as the sewer and drainage plan sets. There are many more plans and documents that should be scanned with backups kept in an offsite storage location. The City intends to continue with this program until all critical records have been scanned. As new records are developed, electronic copies are created as a matter of routine protocol.  Reverse 911: Employ the use of a reverse 911 system in the City of Melrose to better assist the elderly and hazard victims. Status: Partial Completion Action Update: The City uses Reverse 911 for emergency situations and also has implemented the Code Red service for other notifications to residents. The City is presently in the process of reevaluating the choice of systems and will be entering into a contract with a vendor in the near future to serve the needs for community outreach for both emergency and non‐emergency situations. The Melrose Public Schools also use Direct Connect for contact with parents and guardians.  Enroll in the Community Rating System: Fill out the FEMA Community Rating System application so citizens in the City of Melrose who own houses in the 100‐year floodplain can qualify for discounts on flood insurance rate premiums. Status: No Action Action Update: City personnel are not aware of any action on this item, but it will be evaluated moving forward.  South Washington Street Trash Grate: Advise the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation to perform regular cleaning of the trash grate structure located at South Washington Street that often becomes blocked with debris. Status: In Progress Action Update: The City is continually coordinating with the DCR to ensure that this structure is routinely cleaned. The last known cleaning was in October 2018. The City will continue to coordinate with the DCR to ensure this work is done, as it has the potential to have significant impacts on upstream properties if flows are restricted due to the build‐up of debris. In addition to these actions, a short list of secondary actions were identified in the 2004 NHMP, as well as a handful of mitigation measures that were already being performed and are still relevant today. These actions have been carried forward into the later sections of this report for continued implantation or future action. They are as follows:  Maintain Melrose Emergency Management Department: The City has hired a new part‐ time Emergency Management Director in February 2019. This position should be maintained and continue to be funded. 5‐14",
        "Section 5  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions  Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan: The CEMP is a detailed report documenting policies, procedures, responsibilities, and training for various departments within the City. There is also a section detailing specific hazards (e.g., flood, hurricane, fire, etc.) and protocols to deal with these hazards. This plan requires updating to meet current needs and training to ensure proper implementation in the event of an emergency.  Policies for New Construction: The City has policies for new construction within the City ordinances that should be evaluated for opportunities to improve requirements, such as more emphasis on green infrastructure and other natural solutions that provide stormwater handling capacity and treatment and minimize impacts during storm events.  Emergency Shelter Areas: As detailed elsewhere in this report, the City has a plan for emergency shelters that requires updating, and shelters need to be evaluated to ensure they have the required infrastructure to support their use during a variety of emergency conditions.  Winter Storm Snow and Ice Warning Program for Flat Roof Buildings: The purpose of this program was to notify the owners of large flat roof properties of the potential for dangerous snow loads. It was suggested in 2004 to add to this list housing for mentally handicapped individuals and additional flat roof buildings which were not previously notified. This program has now been replaced with warnings placed on the Mayor’s Blog during heavy snow load conditions. This practice is planned to continue, with select outreach from the Inspectional Services Department to particular properties of concern when deemed beneficial.  Blue Warning Lights: In the 2004 NHMP, it was recommended that the City install warning lights at six to eight major intersections to alert citizens of an impending storm, the need for evacuation, or a parking ban. The effectiveness and applicability of these warning systems will be determined when considering whether to implement this type of system.  Wetlands Bylaw: The 2004 NHMP recommended considering whether to expand the City’s zero net runoff policy to all developments, rather than just small developments. This will continue to be considered, along with the policies for new construction noted above.  Fire Sprinkler System in City Hall: The 2004 NHMP recommended installing a sprinkler system throughout City Hall to protect this historic landmark. This has not been implemented and will continue to be considered when upgrades are undertaken for the building. 5‐15",
        "Section 6 Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategies 6.1 Goals for Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategies The goal of each of the hazard mitigation actions outlined in this section is intended to either mitigate the susceptibility of Melrose to a natural hazard or to better prepare the City to protect and manage the community in the occurrence of a natural hazard. This supports the overall goal of the NHMP to identify both known and potential risks from current and future natural hazards and to develop, through the community planning process, actions to reduce the risk from these hazards. Implementing these actions can reduce the risk of loss of life and property in Melrose. 6.2 Mitigation Strategies to Reduce Natural Hazard Risks Mitigation strategies and actions have been developed to address the asset vulnerabilities identified in Section 4.2 and in Section 5. The strategies presented within this section were identified based on overall best practices and through input from the MVP workshops held in April 2018, the MVP/NHMP public meeting held on June 21, 2018, the regional input meeting held on September 25, 2018, and further input from City staff. The City has already taken action on strategies identified, including hiring an Emergency Management Director in February 2019. As with the vulnerabilities identified in Section 4, the hazard mitigation strategies are separated into societal, infrastructure, and environmental categories to address the specific vulnerable assets identified within each. The mitigation strategies presented in this section are described in further detail in Appendix B. The table in Appendix B includes the hazard and vulnerability it is intended to mitigate. The table also identifies the strategy planning and implementation details: the project stage, priority, timeframe for implementation, and responsible party for each mitigation strategy; these are defined in Table 6‐1, below. Table 6‐1. Summary of Mitigation Strategy Planning and Implementation Details Category Definition Project The project stage identifies the type of mitigation strategy (e.g., training, public outreach) and/or Stage when in a project phase the mitigation strategy should be implemented (e.g., planning, design, etc.). Priority The priorities are high, medium, and low, based on feedback from the planning process described in Section 2. Timeframe Timeframe indicates how long a strategy may take to implement:  Ongoing timeframe: Part or all of the strategy is underway.  Short: The strategy may be completed within a five year timeframe.  Long: The strategy may take longer than five years to complete. Responsible The responsible party indicates which entity is responsible for the implementation of the strategy. It Party identifies specific organizations or City partnerships. Where the City is listed as the responsible party, the Public Works Department together with the Emergency Management Director will be responsible for working with relevant City departments on the implementation – including identifying and obtaining project funding sources, as appropriate. 6‐1",
        "Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions 6.2.1 Societal Hazard Mitigation Strategies to Improve Resilience The primary actions that can be taken to improve resiliency against flood, severe weather, and other natural hazard events for societal assets in Melrose are summarized below. Refer to Sections 4.2.1, 4.3, or Appendix B for the vulnerabilities that are addressed through these actions. The table in Appendix B also provides additional details that pertain to each mitigation action that should be referred to during their implementation.  Emergency Management Planning: Update emergency and evacuation plans to consider the increased frequency and intensity of climate change related natural disasters and to make these plans consistent with current and/or improved practices and protocols. This includes community outreach to educate citizens about the City's emergency notification system, to increase the number of people signed up. An up‐to date emergency and evacuation plan would reduce the potential risk posed to public health and safety by establishing standard preparedness and mitigation strategies that address modern day hazards. Additionally, promote the development of individual emergency and evacuation plans for every household and business in the area to ensure families and employers have an established plan of action in the event of an emergency. Continue to update, track progress, and participate in emergency management planning programs on a regular basis to ensure any appropriate changes are made when necessary.  Senior/Aging Population: Implement an education and outreach program for the senior/aging population to increase awareness about emergency response and evacuation plans and greatly improve the resiliency of this vulnerable population through appropriate preparedness. National Grid maintains a utility life support contact list that is used to communicate emergency event information to senior/aging populations. Leverage, update, and or expand this utility life support list to better plan for adequate availability of power and/or emergency relief resources to senior/aging populations, and help to expedite power reconnection for those that need it most. Development of any education and outreach campaign should specifically and clearly address how individuals can be added to National Grid’s utility life support contact list. Install a back‐up power generator at the senior center to ensure power and air conditioning is supplied to the senior/aging population in the event of a natural disaster.  Chronically Ill/Disabled Population: Chronically ill and disabled populations of Melrose face similar vulnerabilities and risks as the senior/aging population, therefore, similar actions are recommended. Additional actions include an education and outreach program at local hospitals, or for the caregivers of chronically ill or disabled individuals, to learn more about appropriate emergency response and evacuation plans. Outreach should promote the addition of any chronically ill or disabled individual, especially those that rely on medical equipment that requires power supply, to the National Grid utility life support contact list. Install back‐up generators at City shelters to provide reliable power and air conditioning at a place of refuge for chronically ill or disabled populations in Melrose, and ensure that designated shelters have appropriate accommodations for this population.  Non‐English Speaking Population: Evaluate the demographic information for the City of Melrose to determine the most prevalent non‐English language(s) among Melrose 6‐2",
        "Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions residents. Information gathered through such efforts could be used to develop effective multi‐lingual signage and education campaigns that provide clear and effective information about evacuation routes and emergency preparedness and response. Multi‐lingual signage along roads and emergency shelter locations, as well as educational advertisements or announcements in local newspapers, tv stations, radio stations, or at faith‐based organizations, can help inform the non‐English speaking population and ultimately reduce the overall risks associated with the inability to appropriately communicate or understand relevant emergency response or health and safety protocols during an emergency.  Low‐Income Population: The City of Melrose and the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development can work together to explore the possibility of developing a cooling assistance program to help low‐income populations pay for air conditioning during extreme heat events. The City will identify public spaces with air conditioning that residents may go to during heat events to cool down and consider providing transportation to these locations. Additionally, potential methods, partnerships, and programs that would help low‐income populations cover replacement costs for essential resources such as food, clothing, transportation, and temporary housing should be investigated. An education and outreach campaign targeting low‐income populations about emergency response and evacuation plans, as well as resources available to them to prepare for and recover from incurred damages, would also be an important and effective means of improving the resiliency of low‐income populations during and after a natural hazard event. The City will identify public spaces with air conditions  Faith Based Organizations: Install back‐up generators at faith‐based organizations to maintain power supply during an outage and allow for the use of such facilities as a safe refuge for those in need during a natural disaster. Efforts that educate faith‐based organization leaders about emergency response and evacuation plans, as well as on available resources that would provide food and water during an emergency, can help improve the City’s resiliency by increasing methods of communication. Coordination with faith‐based organizations may also provide additional shelter space and/or supplies to area residents during a natural hazard event.  Pet Owners: The City should develop a list of possible locations for pets to go during an emergency event that pet owners can easily access. Additionally, the City and local animal shelters can work together to identify designated pet‐friendly emergency shelter locations that would accommodate household pets in the event of a natural disaster. The Animal Control Officer will be included in appropriate hazard mitigation training and planning activities. 6.2.2 Infrastructure Hazard Mitigation Strategies to Improve Resilience The actions that can be taken to improve resiliency against natural hazard events for infrastructure assets in Melrose are summarized below. Refer to Section 4.2.2, 4.3, or Appendix B for the specific hazards and vulnerabilities that are addressed through these actions, along with additional details for implementation. 6‐3",
        "Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions  Transportation Infrastructure: Ensure that existing evacuation routes allow for fast movement and avoid locations prone to flooding, and that evacuation signage is clearly visible and easily understood by English and non‐English speaking populations. Educate City emergency and DPW personnel on route locations and required maintenance, such as the regular removal of debris from storm drains located along evacuation routes. Design and construction efforts that improve the management of stormwater along important roadways can have significant beneficial impacts that would reduce the risk of road closures or damaged infrastructure as a result of flooding or severe weather events. Design and construction efforts include the implementation or expansion of green infrastructure in flood prone areas, as well as upgrades to drainage systems to manage a higher capacity of stormwater. The roadway areas noted in Section 5 require particular attention. An upgrade to the emergency communication and notification system would also ensure that travelers on transportation networks are aware of evacuation routes, delays, and availability of alternative travel routes in real‐time. The City may be able to work with MassDOT, DCR and/or Verizon to identify and develop a standard protocol that would help to notify Melrose residents of evacuation procedures before or during a natural hazard event.  City Hall: Installation of a back‐up generator to provide power during an outage is of high priority to maintaining the City’s communications systems and Emergency Management Command Center. The City should also elevate critical mechanical and electrical equipment above ground level where possible and incorporate dry and/or wet floodproofing techniques that would minimize potential flood damage. Incorporate green infrastructure practices such as bioretention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens, and/or pervious pavement to reduce potential flood impacts within the City Hall parking lot, and regrade the parking lot to accommodate such features. The City also needs to continue to secure critical records, by scanning and storing records in multiple locations including offsite electronic storage.  Fire and Police Stations: Install back‐up power generators at the fire and police stations to maintain power and critical emergency functions at these facilities during a power outage. Protect emergency response equipment and materials within these facilities against flood by relocating equipment, back‐up power generators, and emergency response vehicles outside current and future flood prone areas. If relocation is not possible, materials and equipment can be elevated to the greatest extent practicable to reduce the potential risk of flood damage.  Residential and Commercial Properties: Residential and commercial properties in flood prone areas would particularly benefit from the implementation of green infrastructure practices such as bioswales, rain gardens, rainwater harvesting, bioretention ponds, and pervious pavement. Develop and implement stricter ordinances for new and existing developments to help Melrose protect its residential and commercial buildings from flood damage. Train and/or certify contractors and developers on appropriate resilience measures and changes to ordinances to ensure all new developments are built with resilience to natural hazards in mind. Also continue to ensure that existing building codes are being strictly followed. 6‐4",
        "Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions  Memorial Hall: Memorial Hall is designated as an emergency shelter but lacks emergency backup power and other infrastructure necessary to ensure appropriate lighting and temperatures can be maintained and that appropriate storage is available for food and other supplies. A backup generator should be installed at Memorial Hall if it will continue to be designated as a shelter location. Further measures should be taken to prevent emergency response equipment and supplies from damage by locating them at elevations outside of flooding areas and implementing floodproofing measures where applicable.  Emergency Shelters: Install a back‐up power generator at emergency shelters throughout the City to reliably supply power and heating, ventilation, and air‐conditioning (HVAC) at locations that provide refuge to those in need. Develop an emergency shelter management plan that includes specific guidelines about adequate multi‐lingual signage, as well as information about food supply and storage locations, resources for medications or medical emergencies, and information about water supply. Similar to other emergency response and communication facilities, important equipment and supplies should be protected from potential flood damage through relocation to non‐flood prone areas or materials and equipment should be stored on elevated surfaces above ground level. Elevate existing transportation assets, utilize stormwater best management practices, and regularly clear debris or downed trees along roadways and sidewalks in areas near shelters to ensure easy access during emergencies.  Schools/Child Care Facilities: Upgrade HVAC systems and implement green roofs or tree planting efforts. Implement green infrastructure such as bioretention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens, and/or pervious pavement at Melrose High School and Middle School, and incorporate dry and wet floodproofing techniques in buildings that fall within future flood prone areas. Enforce building codes on fire prevention and elevator maintenance, as well as regular drills and training for students and teachers. Improve school and child care facility preparedness for an emergency and help minimize potential impacts associated with natural hazard events. Installation of a generator at City Hall will also allow for uninterrupted communications at the school facilities which use the City Hall infrastructure for connectivity.  Melrose‐Wakefield Hospital: Coordinate and cross‐train emergency management personnel from the City and the hospital so both are aware of emergency plans and protocols, including a plan to continuously and effectively communicate the Hospital’s capacity and hazard exposure with emergency personnel and the media during an emergency event. Elevate existing transportation assets, use stormwater best management practices, and regularly clear debris or downed vegetation along roadways leading to the hospital. Dry and wet floodproofing techniques may also be implemented throughout the hospital to help improve resiliency against flood impacts. Investigate if the hospital could act as a 24‐hour pharmacy to the public before, during, and/or after an emergency situation to serve as a location where the public may acquire needed medications when pharmacies may be closed or have inadequate supply.  Pharmacies: Store in‐demand or difficult to acquire medications outside future flood prone areas, or off the floor above possible flooding areas, to protect such valuable supplies 6‐5",
        "Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions from being inundated and lost during a severe flood. Extend hours of operation prior to an emergency to ensure the public has adequate opportunity to acquire needed medications as appropriate. Elevate existing transportation assets, use stormwater best management practices, and regularly clear debris or downed vegetation along roadways leading to the pharmacies.  Gas Infrastructure: Regularly maintain and restore damaged gas line infrastructure, as well as the monitor waterways where buried gas lines are nearby for scour or erosion. Use appropriate resilient design and materials when upgrading or expanding gas pipelines. Regularly train and/or certify gas infrastructure contractors and National Grid personnel on resiliency protocols. Continue to aggressively work with the National Grid to have leak prone pipe materials replaced with more resilient materials.  Electrical/Power Infrastructure: Implement microgrids where feasible to minimize the occurrence of wide scale power outages and expedite power reconnections. Maintain a buffer or clear zone between the edge of power lines and adjacent tree belts or woodland areas to minimize the potential for outages incurred as a result of falling trees or limbs. Elevate critical electrical equipment in future flood prone areas to protect against potential flood damages. Regularly maintain and repair damaged electrical systems and power infrastructure. Construct alternative energy systems and use renewable energy as the primary energy source where possible. Upgrade electric utility lines and/or install buried lines when feasible. Develop of a list of available “on call” electricians that can connect National Grid power lines from poles to the homes of at risk populations. Identify and repair locations where buried electrical infrastructure is prone to flooding and associated failure. Develop an ongoing training program to properly educate the City’s labor force on appropriate emergency response actions and ensure National Grid has done the same. Develop procedures and plans for when peak power demand exceeds capacity during an extreme heat event and/or the develop and implement design standards for electrical equipment that can withstand higher maximum temperatures.  Fuel Sources: Designate secure fuel storage locations for fuel reserves used during a natural disaster away from flood prone areas. Partner with gas stations across the City to extend hours of operation prior to an emergency event to ensure the public has access to adequate fuel supplies for long‐term hazard events.  Food Sources: Designate secure food storage locations away from flood prone areas to house food reserves that would be used in the event of a natural disaster. Partner with grocery stores to extend hours of operation prior to an emergency event to ensure the public has access to adequate supplies of food and water for long‐term hazard events. Grocery stores and food pantries should also be involved in the development of emergency shelter management plans to ensure adequate food and water supplies are available to emergency shelters during a natural hazard event. In addition, food source and safety information will be provided in multiple languages.  Communications Infrastructure: Close the City’s fiberoptic loop to form a redundant pathway for information to get back through the network if there is a breach in the loop. A voice over internet protocol (VOIP) system could also be utilized to allow telephone 6‐6",
        "Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions networks to quickly be routed to another location which would allow City officials’ phone numbers to travel with their cell phones. This would facilitate uninterrupted communication with City officials during the planning and coordination phase of emergency response and during and post disaster. Bury communication lines where possible. Maintain and restore damaged communication infrastructure. Upgrade emergency communication and real‐time notification systems used by travelers on transportation networks. Elevate critical communication equipment, or relocate equipment away from future flood prone areas. Ensure access to portable cell towers and generator systems that can provide temporary communication and electrical services to areas that need it during an emergency event. Ensure information technology (IT) equipment has redundancy, uninterrupted power supply, and other precautions for unforeseen events where deemed beneficial. Develop ongoing training programs that properly educate the labor force on appropriate emergency response actions.  Sewer Pumping Stations: Install back‐up power (either onsite or portable) and bypass capability at the five sewer pumping stations. Elevate pumping station equipment located within flood prone areas, where possible. Regularly maintain and repair damaged infrastructure, and continue infiltration and inflow reduction measures in sewers to prevent backups and overflows during high flow events.  Water Pumping Stations: Elevate water pumping station equipment located within flood prone areas, where possible. Regularly maintain and repair damaged infrastructure. Routinely maintain backup equipment to ensure its availability during emergency events.  Water and Sewer Pipelines: Identify areas of concern and prioritize repair and replacement efforts through water and wastewater infrastructure condition assessments. Regularly maintain and repair damaged infrastructure, and develop ongoing training programs to properly educate the labor force on appropriate emergency response actions. Training should include updating water system emergency response plans and understanding MWRA emergency protocols. Coordinate with neighboring towns and cities with regard to mutual aid water connections and potential sewer surcharge conditions when sending wastewater downstream. Maintain the map of mutual aid connections in the Water System Emergency Response Plan.  Stormwater Drainage Infrastructure: Conduct stormwater drainage studies to address flooding that results from insufficient capacity or other deficiencies in the drainage system, including the areas listed in Section 5. Results can be used to strategically repair deficiencies, increase capacity, or construct green infrastructure in areas that would benefit the most. Dredge stormwater outfalls in areas prone to flooding, as well as develop and implement a stormwater maintenance plan. Keep stormwater infrastructure mapping up‐ to‐date. Coordinate with neighboring towns, cities, and state agencies when sending drainage downstream and monitor associated infrastructure issues. 6.2.3 Environmental Hazard Mitigation Strategies to Improve Resilience The actions that can be taken to improve resiliency against flood, severe weather, and other natural hazard events for environmental assets in Melrose are summarized below. Refer to 6‐7",
        "Section 6  Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy and Actions Section 4.2.3, 4.3, or Appendix B for the vulnerabilities that are addressed through these actions and additional details for implementation.  Water Bodies: Lakes/Rivers/Reservoirs: Investigate opportunities to install flood control gates that would better manage flows during a significant flood event. Increase channel capacity within streams and rivers by removing large obstacles within channels or through the dredging of water features in flood prone areas. Plant trees and vegetation to expand vegetative buffers and stabilize river and stream embankments to reduce erosion and scour during high flow events while also mitigating the impacts that high temperatures can have on aquatic habitats. Encourage green infrastructure through City policies, ordinances, and design standards to better manage stormwater runoff and potentially reduce impacts associated with flood events.  Parks/Natural Areas/Open Space: Investigate and implement mosquito management measures, including ditch maintenance, to reduce the spread of disease from current and new mosquito populations, as appropriate. Protect and expand wetland areas, natural systems, and vegetative buffers where possible to improve flood management and conserve natural areas. Conduct routine maintenance of parks and natural areas to remove or relocate dead vegetation to reduce the risk of wildfire during drought or extreme heat conditions.  Tree Canopy: Create a funded tree warden or certified arborist position, or train existing personnel to obtain certification, to advise on resilient tree species and provide tree canopy assessments. Consider public‐private partnerships for funding tree planting and maintenance. Conduct routine monitoring of street trees and trees in parks and natural areas, to reduce the potential for wildfire, downed trees or limbs damaging communication, electrical, transportation, or other infrastructure assets. Efforts should focus on preserving and enhancing the tree canopy to reduce urban heat island effects and reduce emissions from cooling loads. Offer incentive programs or outreach targeting property owners to plant trees with higher survivability and resiliency against extreme conditions.  Wildlife: Investigate mosquito management measures that would help reduce the spread of disease within the wildlife or human populations of Melrose. Protect, expand, or restore wetland areas, natural systems, and vegetative buffers and perform routine monitoring of those areas for potential threats to vegetation, including the identification and potential removal of invasive species. Promote green infrastructure that provides habitat value in addition to stormwater volume and quality mitigation where possible.  Air Quality: Develop an air quality monitoring and alert system to notify the population of Melrose of poor air quality events and provide recommendations for safe levels of outdoor activity to reduce the risk of health impacts associated with air pollution, and provide a link on the City's website. Plant trees in urban areas. Continue to implement Complete Streets principles as well as the enforcement of anti‐idling laws for vehicles. Create campaigns that encourage behaviors that decrease energy use and reduce emissions. 6‐8",

        "Section 7 Implementation of the Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan 7.1 Implementation Process and Monitoring The goal of this NHMP is to identify both known and potential risks from current and future natural hazards and to develop, through the community planning process, actions to reduce the risk from these hazards. This NHMP represents the culmination of a significant planning effort that involved stakeholders from across City government, the community, and regional partners. This NHMP is the primary resilience planning document in the City of Melrose, the findings of which will be incorporated into planning documents and processes including the City’s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan. The mitigation strategies to address hazards summarized in Section 6 identify the responsible party for implementation along with the priority set by the community planning process. The implementation of high priority hazard mitigation strategies will be monitored by the responsible parties shown in Section 7.3 unless otherwise noted in Appendix B. In general, implementation of the recommendations in this NHMP will be tracked by the Public Works Department together with the Emergency Management Director on an ongoing basis for the effectiveness of achieving the NHMP goals. The NHMP will be available to the public on the City’s website along with the primary contact information for the Department of Public Works (DPW), the City Engineer, and the Emergency Management Director, all of whom will be available to receive and respond to public input on this NHMP. The DPW Director, City Engineer, and/or Emergency Management Director will present on the NHMP’s progress to the Board of Aldermen on an annual basis. Meetings with the Board of Aldermen are open to the public and broadcast on the City’s local television station, MMTV. The Public Works Department will also bring outreach materials on preparedness and resilience that are developed as a result of this NHMP to the booth they host at the City’s annual Victorian Fair every September – a popular, well‐attended public event. An Emergency Management team made up of the Police Department, Fire Department, Public Works Department, Emergency Management Department, Information Technology Department, and Mayor’s Office meets on a regular basis. The Director of Public Works and the Emergency Management Director will use this forum as a platform to present hazards and vulnerabilities identified in this NHMP and update this group on the status of the prioritized mitigation strategies. They will also solicit additional feedback on this NHMP as needed from the Emergency Management team. In addition, this NHMP will be evaluated regularly and reevaluated following any natural disaster to ensure it remains up to date and useful by the DPW Director and the Emergency Management Director. The Public Work Department will also oversee the formal adoption of the NHMP by the City – documentation of which is available in Appendix C. 7‐1",
        "Section 7  Implementation of the Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan 7.2 Schedule for Updating the Plan The City has committed to updating the NHMP every five years as required by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. The Public Works Department will spearhead the next Melrose NHMP Update beginning no later than mid‐2023. The update of the NHMP will meet the requirements in place at the time of its publication, including any public meetings, updates on the implementation of prioritized mitigation strategies, and an evaluation of further refined climate data, as available. Public meeting information will be widely publicized at least one week prior to each meeting. 7.3 Responsible Parties and Contacts Multiple agencies within the City government, community members, and regional partners provided input into this NHMP.

Melrose, Massachusetts.",
        "Summary of Findings 1.1 Overview The City of Melrose was awarded a $19,000 grant from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to conduct Community Resilience Building (CRB) workshops in the City. This funding is through a new program called Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP). Conducting the workshops allows Melrose to achieve “MVP” designation from the Commonwealth – a designation that gives the City access to further funding to implement resilient actions. Melrose is also in the process of updating the Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan (HMP) and will incorporate the findings from the CRB workshops; the HMP will be the primary resilience planning document for the City of Melrose. The City engaged the consulting firm, CDM Smith, to assist with both efforts. 1.2 Community Resilience Building Workshops In Melrose, the workshops held in conjunction with the MVP program were a new initiative to immediately integrate community‐derived priorities into a natural hazard mitigation process and identify actions to build resilience in the community. The workshops’ central objectives were to:  Define top local natural and climate‐related hazards of concern;  Identify existing and future strengths and vulnerabilities;  Develop prioritized actions for the community;  Identify immediate opportunities to collaboratively advance actions to increase resilience. A core team was established for this process, which consisted of:  Martha Grover, Energy Efficiency Manager  Elena Proakis Ellis, City Engineer  John Scenna, Director of Public Works Prior to the workshops, the core team identified preliminary hazards and areas of concerns. These were mapped and presented at the workshops and included in a participatory mapping exercise (see Appendix A). The core team, along with the consultant, identified departments and organizations recommended to attend the workshops. These were: Chamber of Commerce, Comcast, Conservation Commission, Department of Public Works, EMARC, Emergency Management Department, Fire Department, First Congregational Church, First Methodist Church, Friends of the Fells, Hallmark Health Emergency Preparedness, Health Department, Human Rights Commission, Information Technology, Mayor's Office, Melrose Energy Commission, Melrose Historical Commission, Melrose Housing Authority, Melrose Public Schools, Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, Mystic Valley Elder Services, National Grid, Office of Planning and Community Development, Parks Department, Pedestrian and Bicycle 1‐1",
        "Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building Advisory Committee, Police Department, Riverside Community Care, State Representatives/ Senators, and Verizon. All were invited by the Mayor to participate; see section 1.3.3 for a specific list of workshop participants. The workshops were held on two days: Thursday, April 5, and Wednesday, April 11, 2018. Prior to attending the workshops, the participants were asked to fill out a survey, a copy of which can be found in Appendix B, along with the survey results. 1.2.1 Top Hazards and Vulnerable Areas At the first workshop, participants were asked to identify connections between ongoing community issues, hazards, and local planning and actions in Melrose. They were also asked to identify and map vulnerabilities and strengths to develop infrastructure, societal, and environmental risk profiles for Melrose. Maps reflecting City landmarks and facilities, existing and potential areas of flooding concern, and possible heat impacts were prepared for discussion (see Appendix A). To facilitate this exercise, the following definitions from the World Bank1 were discussed with participants:  Hazard: A physical process or event (hydro‐meteorological or oceanographic variables or phenomena) that can harm human health, livelihoods, or natural resources.  Risk: The potential for consequences where something is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain.  Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental services and resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places that could be adversely affected by a hazard.  Sensitivity: The degree to which a system, asset, or species may be affected, either adversely or beneficially, when exposed to climate variability or change or geophysical hazards.  Vulnerability or Strength: The potential effects of hazards on human or natural assets and systems. These potential effects, which are determined by both exposure and sensitivity, may be beneficial or harmful. As a brainstorming exercise, participants were asked the following triggering questions from the CRB Workshop Guide:  What hazards have impacted Melrose in the past? Where, how often, and in what ways?  What hazards are impacting your community currently?  What effects will these hazards/changes have on Melrose in the future (3, 5, 10, 25 years)?  What/who is exposed to hazards and climate threats within your community?  Other concerns or considerations? 1 Source: World Bank: https://climatescreeningtools.worldbank.org/content/key‐terms‐0 1‐2",
        "Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building The hazards, risks, and vulnerabilities from this brainstorming session are presented in Figure 1‐ 1. Figure 1‐1 Melrose Hazards, Risks, and Vulnerabilities (brainstorm results) CDMth Sm1 1‐3",
        "Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building 1.2.1.1 Top Hazards The Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs (EEA) summarized the existing and expected future climate conditions by major watershed in the Commonwealth. Melrose falls into two watersheds; however, the majority of the City is in the Boston Harbor Basin. Therefore, projections from this basin were used as a basis for discussing future climate change in the City (see Appendix C). The key takeaways2 from EEA on the future climate conditions are:  Regardless of geographic scale, rising temperatures, changing precipitation, and extreme weather will continue to affect the people and resources of the Commonwealth.  Average, maximum, and minimum temperatures are expected to increase; seasonally, maximum summer and fall temperatures are expected to see the highest projected increase and minimum winter and fall temperatures are expected to increase.  The number of days receiving precipitation over one inch are variable, fluctuating between loss and gain of days.  Seasonal projections for total precipitation are also variable for the Boston Harbor basin. The winter season is expected to experience the greatest change with an increase of 0‐20% by mid‐century, and 3‐34% by end of century.  Annual and seasonal projections for consecutive dry days, or for a given period, are variable.  Precipitation will be more variable. “Extreme” precipitation events are likely to occur more often. With these climate change impacts in mind, the group was divided into three working groups, each of which was asked to identify the top four hazards from this list or others they felt were important to address. The Top Hazards were:  Extreme temperature3 (3 groups)  Flooding (2 groups)  Major Storms (2 groups)  Wind (2 groups)  Power Loss (2 groups)  Disease (1 group) 2 These impacts are direct from the document provided by EEA to MVP communities in December 2017 entitled “Massachusetts Climate Change Projections.” 3 One group identified extreme heat; two groups identified extreme temperatures which includes heat and cold. 1‐4",
        "Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building 1.2.1.2 Areas of Concern Identified by Core Team Prior to the meeting, the core team identified areas of concern due to potential hazards. They included sanitary sewer overflows, the ability to respond to large snowstorms, and the need for back‐up power at sewer pump stations, cooling stations, and especially at City Hall. Additional areas with flooding concerns were noted to include:  Geneva Road drainage that ties into Upham Street  Outfalls at Wyoming Cemetery, downstream to Malden, and structure at Swain’s Pond  Connection between Towners Pond and Swain’s Pond  Lebanon Street at Sylvan Street  City Hall parking lot  Railway bridge at Melrose Street  Conant Park at Ravine Terrace  Derby Road 1.2.2 Current Concerns and Challenges Presented by Hazards Melrose has faced natural hazards in the past like other Massachusetts communities, including flooding from the Mother’s Day storm in 2006, overwhelming snowfall totals during the winter of 2015, and most recently the nor’easter events in January and March 2018. During the March 2018 storm, City Hall lost power, which disabled the phone lines to emergency responders. In addition to the areas of concern raised by the core team, participants identified other concerns and challenges during the brainstorming session at the first workshop. These included:  Maintaining and improving quality of life in Melrose  Managing insects, pests, and wildlife with changes in precipitation patterns and increasing temperatures  Ability to stay in good financial standing and obtain insurance despite climate stressors  Cyber security concerns, maintaining communication pathways, and information technology systems (IT) during events  Vulnerability of transportation systems to all hazards – including: 1) pothole maintenance from multiple freeze‐thaw periods and 2) public transportation reliability  Damage to property during events 1‐5",
        "Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building  Population increases and the demands on public systems and housing availability  Fallen trees during storms and the ability to remove them in a timely manner  Poor air quality as temperatures rise, especially during heat waves  Increasing energy use and strain on the electrical grid during heat waves  Maintaining water quality through changing conditions  Ability of aging infrastructure to withstand current and future hazards 1.2.3 Specific Categories of Concerns and Challenges The working groups further discussed specific concerns and challenges in each of the categories of infrastructure, society, and environment. These findings, characterized as vulnerabilities, are presented in Appendix D in the Risk Matrix and in Table 1‐1 below. Of particular concern, as highlighted by every working group, was the lack of emergency generation capacity at City Hall. Melrose City Hall is the hub of communications in Melrose; calls to police, fire, ambulance, and schools are all routed through City Hall. During a power outage, like the one experienced during the March 2018 nor’easter, calls to these important services do not go through and calling out from land line phones is not feasible. This results in potential hazards of the highest magnitude through the lack of immediate communication during storm related events. 1.2.4 Current Strengths and Assets The working groups discussed strengths and community assets in each of the categories of infrastructure, society, and environment during the latter half of the first workshop. These findings are presented in Appendix D in the Risk Matrix and in Table 1‐1 below. Several strengths of note were discussed, including:  Melrose has improved and upgraded stormwater systems to manage and mitigate existing flooding issues. These include drainage improvements to Ell Pond and have had a dramatically positive impact on the community.  There are many faith‐based organizations and associated places of worship in Melrose. These are a strength due to the community resilience they provide, the potential to use these organizations as a conduit for information to the public, and as a physical location of refuge and aid during or after an event.  Melrose has an excellent team of first responders and emergency action plans. This coupled with a local hospital are community strengths; however, the emergency planning documents require updating, which is a vulnerability.  Melrose has a Shelter Management Plan and identified shelters to provide for citizens during a time of need, which is a strength, although services at these locations require review (e.g., air conditioning, backup power, food availability and storage, etc.) 1‐6",

        "Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building 1.2.5 Actions to Improve Resilience The second workshop was focused on developing and prioritizing actions to improve resilience in the City. Each working group developed actions that would reduce vulnerability and enhance strengths for the features identified during the first workshop. The actions target one or multiple of the hazards in each of the categories of infrastructure, society, and environment. These actions were prioritized by each group as a high, medium, or low priority and assigned a timeframe for action of either short, long, or ongoing. These findings are presented in Appendix D in the Risk Matrix. 1.2.5.1 Top Recommendations to Improve Resilience Each working group identified the top five priority actions to improve resilience based on vulnerabilities and strengths identified by their group. These were presented to all workshop participants, who then voted on their top priorities from the aggregated list. The top action across every team was the need to install an emergency generator at City Hall. This project naturally rose to the top of the immediate needs list for the City of Melrose. The top five priority actions presented by the working groups were:  Install a generator at critical public buildings and shelters4 (1 group), specifically City Hall (3 groups)  Install back‐up power and bypass capability at water and sewer pump stations, including elevating infrastructure as appropriate (2 groups)  Create a communications plan / conduct public outreach on hazards (2 groups)  Update the emergency management plan which includes an evacuation plan, communication, and drills (2 group) 4 One group generators at public buildings – including City Hall; two groups identified generators at City Hall specifically. 1‐8",
        "Summary of Findings – Community Resilience Building  Dredge stormwater outfalls, obtain a universal permit, and create a maintenance plan, which includes mosquito management (2 groups)  Update the MS4 permit (1 group)  Implement green infrastructure and green buildings, including zoning, stormwater, green energy, best management practices for developers, specific projects (1 group)  Create a funded, dedicated emergency management director and a memorandum of understanding for emergency response (1 group)  Create a funded tree warden position to advise on resilient tree species and consider public‐private partnerships for funding for maintenance and planting (1 group) After each team presented on their top five actions, each person was allowed three votes to allocate to any of the actions as show in Figure 1‐2. This voting process determined the prioritized actions which are the Top Recommendations to Improve Resilience in Melrose. Furthermore, some sub‐categories were established within these top priorities, as shown below: 1. Install an emergency generator at City Hall (17 votes) 2. Advance stormwater management actions including (9 votes): a. Dredge stormwater outfalls, b. Create a stormwater permit and maintenance plan, and c.

Increased stormwater leads to increased nuisance flooding, increased levels of pollutants entering the region's waterbodies, and higher demands on the combined sewer system. Stormwater also creates other challenges, including increased carbon emissions as water is pumped through sewer systems and then treated in treatment plants. This map highlights areas that may be at risk of decreased water quality and increased flooding due to increased rainfall events and was created by combining the following criteria: Current Flood Zones Estimated Runoff Potential Soil Permeability Slope Existing Wetlands Coastal Adaption Areas Sinks Water Quality Legend µ Figure 2: 1 Climate-Smart Cities Layers Metro Mayor's Police Station Affordable Housing Pavement !··-··1 Stormwater Challenges i.. ___ j Metro Mayors study area boundary r - 1 Fire Station Long Term Care Historic District Metro Area Planning Council (MAPC) town boundary City of Melrose, MA L _____ ; Priority lands already under protection City Hall Historic District Buildings Conservation Land Parks, open space, or other protected land ^^ Town Boundary Hospital Emergency Generators Addressing stormwater challenges priorities #* Railroad School Emergency Shelter • Veryhigh High Courts Library D Pump Stations 0 400 800 1,600 Moderate Feet \") P Water Pump Station \") P Wastewater Pump Station Source: City of Melrose, MassGIS, FEMA, TPL, and MAPC CDMlh 1) Climate-Smart Cities: Metro Mayor Climate-Smart Region, November 13, 2017 Coordinate System: NAD83 Mass.

        "Appendix B: Pre‐Workshop Survey Questions and Results Melrose Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness program Pre-Workshop Survey: March/April 2018 Thank you in advance for your involvement in the two-part Community Resilience Building Workshop series for Melrose’s Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) planning process and our upcoming Community Resilience Building workshops on April 5 and April 11, 2018. We are excited to work with you to identify and prioritize actions to improve Melrose’s resilience to climate change. These actions will aim to reduce impacts from climate-related hazards to infrastructural, societal, and environmental components to our community – today, and in the future. This information will also be used in conjunction with the on-going Hazard Mitigation Plan update which gives the City the opportunity to apply for grant funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for projects that are necessary to mitigate risks to the community from natural disasters. We are asking participants to complete this brief survey, which focuses on how the community currently perceives, assesses, and acts to reduce risks. This will help us understand your concerns and priorities to make the most of our workshops.

        "Appendix C: Climate projections provided by the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs MASSACHUSETTS CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTIONS Researchers from the Northeast Climate Science Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst developed downscaled projections for changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea level rise for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs has provided support for these projections to enable municipalities, industry, organizations, state government and others to utilize a standard, peer‐reviewed set of climate change projections that show how the climate is likely to change in Massachusetts through the end of this century. Temperature and Precipitation Projections The temperature and precipitation climate change projections are based on simulations from the latest generation of climate models1 from the International Panel on Climate Change and scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions.2 The models were carefully selected from a larger ensemble of climate models based on their ability to provide reliable climate information for the Northeast U.S., while maintaining diversity in future projections that capture some of the inherent uncertainty in modeling climate variables like precipitation. The medium (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) emission scenarios were chosen for possible pathways of future greenhouse gas emissions. A moderate scenario of future greenhouse gas emissions assumes a peak around mid‐century, which then declines rapidly over the second half of the century, while the highest scenario assumes the continuance of the current emissions trajectory. Fourteen climate models have been run with 2 emission scenarios each, which lead to 28 projections. The values cited in the tables below are based on the 10‐90th percentiles across the 28 projections, so they bracket the most likely scenarios. For simplicity, we use the terms “…expected to…,” and “…will be…,” but recognize that these are estimates based on model scenarios and are not predictive forecasts. The statewide projections comprising county‐ and basin‐level information are derived by statistically downscaling the climate model results.3 They represent the best estimates that we can currently provide for a range of anticipated changes in greenhouse gases. Note that precipitation projections are generally more uncertain than temperature. 1These latest generation of climate models are included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), which formed the basis of projections summarized in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2013). 2 Future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios are typically expressed as “Representative Concentration Pathways” (RCPs). They indicate emissions trajectories that would lead to certain levels of radiative forcing by 2100, relative to the pre‐industrial state of the atmosphere; RCP4.5 equates to +4.5W m‐2, and RCP 8.5 would be +8.5W m‐2. In effect, they represent different pathways that society may or may not follow, to reduce emissions through climate change mitigation measures. 3 The Local Constructed Analogs (LOCA) method (Pierce et al., 2014) was used for the statistical downscaling of the statewide projections.",
        "The downscaled temperature and precipitation projections for the Commonwealth are provided at three geographic scales (Table 1) for annual and seasonal temporal scales (Table 2), and can be accessed through the Massachusetts Climate Change Clearinghouse website (www.massclimatechange.org). The statewide projections are included in this guidebook, but temperature and precipitation projections at each of the Commonwealth’s major basins are accessible on the website and as a supplemental PDF to this guide. These climate projections are provided to help municipal officials, state agency staff, land managers, and others to identify future hazards related to, or exacerbated by changing climatic conditions. For the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) program participants, we recommend using climate projections downscaled to the major basin scale (Table 1) as there are regional differences across several climate indicators (Table 3). These projections can help MVP communities to think through how future hazards in their community may change, given projected changes in temperature and precipitation. Regardless of geographic scale, rising temperatures, changing precipitation, and extreme weather will continue to affect the people and resources of the Commonwealth throughout the 21st century. A first step in becoming more climate-resilient is to identify the climate changes your community will be exposed to, the impacts and risks to critical assets, functions, vulnerable populations arising from these changes, the underlying sensitivities to these types of changes, and the background stressors that may exacerbate overall vulnerability.

        "Table 3: List and definitions of projected temperature indicators Climate Climate Indicator Definition Variable Average annual or seasonal temperature expressed in degrees Average temperature Fahrenheit (⁰F). Maximum annual or seasonal temperature expressed in degrees Maximum temperature Fahrenheit (⁰F). Minimum annual or seasonal temperature expressed in degrees Minimum temperature Fahrenheit (⁰F). Days with Tmax > 90 ⁰F Number of days when daily maximum temperature exceeds 90⁰F. Days with Tmax > 95 ⁰F Number of days when daily maximum temperature exceeds 95⁰F. Days with Tmax > 100 ⁰F Number of days when daily maximum temperature exceeds 100⁰F. Days with Tmin < 32 ⁰F Number of days when daily minimum temperature is below 32 ⁰F. Days with Tmin < 0 ⁰F Number of days when daily minimum temperature is below 0 ⁰F. Heating degree-days (HDD) are a measure of how much and for how long outside air temperature was lower than a specific base temperature. HDD are the difference between the average daily Heating degree-days temperature and 65°F. For example, if the mean temperature is (base 65 ⁰F) 30°F, we subtract the mean from 65 and the result is 30 heating degree-days for that day. HDD serves as a proxy that captures Temperature energy consumption required to heat buildings, and is used in utility planning and building design.5 Cooling degree days (CDD) are a measure of how much and for how long outside air temperature was higher than a specific base temperature. CDD are the difference between the average daily Cooling degree-days temperature and 65°F. For example, if the temperature mean is (base 65 ⁰F) 90°F, we subtract 65 from the mean and the result is 25 cooling degree-days for that day. CDD serves as a proxy that captures energy consumption required to cool buildings, and is used in utility planning and building design. 6 Growing degree days (GDD) are a measure of heat accumulation that can be correlated to express crop maturity (plant development). GDD is computed by subtracting a base temperature of 50°F from the average of the maximum and Growing degree-days minimum temperatures for the day. Minimum temperatures less (base 50 ⁰F) than 50°F are set to 50, and maximum temperatures greater than 86°F are set to 86. These substitutions indicate that no appreciable growth is detected with temperatures lower than 50° or greater than 86°.7 5 For seasonal or annual projections, HDD are summed for the period of interest. For example, for winter HDD, one would sum the HDD for December 1 through February 28. Degree-days are not the equivalent of calendar days and thus why it is possible to have more than 365 degree-days. 6 For seasonal or annual projections, CDD are summed for the period of interest. For example, for summer CDD, one would sum the CDD for June 1 through August 31. Degree-days are not the equivalent of calendar days and thus why it is possible to have more than 365 degree-days. 7 Definition adapted from National Weather Service.

For a given period, the largest number of Consecutive dry days consecutive days with precipitation less than 1 mm (0.039 inches). Impacts from Increasing Temperatures Warmer temperatures and extended heat waves could have very significant impacts on public health in our state, as well as the health of plants, animals and ecosystems like forests and wetlands. Rising temperatures will also affect important economic sectors like agriculture and tourism, and infrastructure like the electrical grid. Annual air temperatures in the Northeast have been warming at an average rate of 0.5°F (nearly 0.26°C) per decade since 1970. Winter temperatures have been rising at a faster rate of 0.9°F8 per decade on average. Even what seems like a very small rise in average temperatures can cause major changes in other factors, such as the relative proportion of precipitation that falls as rain or snow. In Massachusetts, temperatures are projected to increase significantly over the next century. Winter average temperatures are likely to increase more than those in summer, with major impacts on everything from winter recreation to increased pests and challenges to harvesting for the forestry industry. Beyond this general warming trend, Massachusetts will experience an increasing number of days with extreme heat in the future (Table 3). Generally, extreme heat is considered to be over 90 degrees F, because at temperatures above that threshold, heat-related illnesses and mortality show a marked increase. Extreme heat can be especially damaging in urban areas, where there is often a concentration of vulnerable populations, and where more impervious surfaces such as streets and parking lots 8 NOAA National Centers for Environmental information, Climate at a Glance: U.S. Time Series, Average Temperature, published December 2017, retrieved on December 21, 2017 from http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/",
        "and less vegetation cause a “heat island” effect that makes them hotter compared to neighboring rural areas. Urban residents in Massachusetts – especially those who are very young, ill, or elderly, and those who live in older buildings without air conditioning – will face greater risks of serious heat-related illnesses when extreme heat becomes more common. Extreme heat and dry conditions or drought could also be detrimental to crop production, harvest and livestock. While warmer winters may reduce burdens on energy systems, more heat in the summer may put larger demands on aging systems, creating the potential for power outages. The number of cooling degree days is expected to increase significantly by the end of the century adding to this strain. In addition, heat can directly stress transmission lines, substations, train tracks, roads and bridges, and other critical infrastructure. Impacts from Changing Precipitation Conditions Rainfall is expected to increase in spring and winter months in particular in Massachusetts, with increasing consecutive dry days in summer and fall. More total rainfall can have an impact on the frequency of minor but disruptive flooding events, especially in areas where storm water infrastructure has not been adequately sized to accommodate higher levels. Increased total rainfall will also affect agriculture, forestry and natural ecosystems. More intense downpours often lead to inland flooding as soils become saturated and stop absorbing more water, river flows rise, and the capacity of urban storm water systems is exceeded. Flooding may occur as a result of heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or coastal flooding associated with high wind and wave action, but precipitation is the strongest driver of flooding in Massachusetts. Winter flooding is also common in the state, particularly when the ground is frozen. The Commonwealth experienced 22 flood-related disaster declarations from 1954 to 2017 with many of these falling in winter or early spring, or during recent hurricanes. The climate projections suggest that the frequency of high-intensity rainfall events will trend upward. Overall, it is anticipated that the severity of flood-inducing weather events and storms will increase, with events that produce sufficient precipitation to present a risk of flooding likely increasing. A single intense downpour can cause flooding and widespread damage to property and critical infrastructure. The coast will experience the greatest increase in high-intensity rainfall days, but some level of increase will occur in every area of Massachusetts. Intense rainfall in urbanized areas can cause pollutants on roads and parking lots to get washed into nearby rivers and lakes, reducing habitat quality. As rainfall and snowfall patterns change, certain habitats and species that have specific physiological requirements may be affected.",
        "Climate projections for Massachusetts indicate that in future decades, winter precipitation could increase, but by the end of the century most of this precipitation is likely to fall as rain instead of snow due to warmer winters. There are many human and environmental impacts that could result from this change including reduced snow cover for winter recreation and tourism, less spring snow melt to replenish aquifers, higher levels of winter runoff, and lower spring river flows for aquatic ecosystems. A small projected decrease in average summer precipitation in Massachusetts could combine with higher temperatures to increase the frequency of episodic droughts, like the one experienced across the Commonwealth in the summer of 2016. Droughts will create challenges for local water supply by reducing surface water storage and the recharge of groundwater supplies, including private wells. More frequent droughts could also exacerbate the impacts of flood events by damaging vegetation that could otherwise help mitigate flooding impacts. Droughts may also weaken tree root systems, making them more susceptible to toppling during high wind events.",
